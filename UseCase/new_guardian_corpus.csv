2015-12-17T08:44:33Z,Where media fails on the reporting of migrants and refugees,"Journalists who report on the global migration and refugee crisis often fail to tell the full story and routinely fall into propaganda traps laid by politicians, according to a report published by the Ethical Journalism Network (EJN). “Around the world, media coverage is often politically led with journalists following an agenda dominated by loose language and talk of invasion and swarms,” said Aidan White, EJN’s director. But it doesn’t have to be like that. As White said: “At other moments the story is laced with humanity, empathy and a focus on the suffering of those involved.” The 100-page report, Moving Stories, has been released just ahead of the United Nations-sponsored International Migrants Day on Friday 18 December. It reviews media coverage of migration in the European Union and in 14 countries across the world. Among the topics it highlights are: Missed opportunities: How European media outlets failed to raise the alarm about an imminent influx of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq, even though the story was there to be told a year before the crisis broke in 2015. Hate speech: How malevolent anti-migrant or anti-Muslim statements by politicians like Donald Trump in the United States and some European leaders fuelled increasing public concern and hijacked media coverage. Falling standards: How media failed to provide detailed and reliable information about the refugee crisis because of stretched editorial resources or due to the lack of presence of well-informed journalists able to provide in-depth and sensitive reporting; Sensationalism: How much journalism is driven by hyperbole, intolerance and distortion with media in confusion over what are the correct terms to use to describe migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. To counter these problems, the report recommends that news media take urgent action to appoint specialist reporters to the migration beat. It also calls for industry wide and in-house training on migration issues and problems of hate-speech; improved links with migrant and refugee groups; and more employment of journalists from ethnic minority communities to strengthen diversity in newsrooms. The report highlights how media coverage, much of it negative and focused on numbers of migrants on the move, took a dramatic turn with the death of Alan Kurdi and the publication of pictures of his body on a beach in Turkey. It was only from that moment that editors woke up to the human tragedy within the migration story. In his foreword to the report Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, sums up the challenge facing media: “It is not just a lack of humanity on the news agenda or a matter of luck or a matter of caring more about some people at the expense of others. We need a broader lens to see what really is going on. The reports states: “There is a tendency, both among many politicians and in sections of the mainstream media, to lump migrants together and present them as a seemingly endless tide of people who will steal jobs, become a burden on the state and ultimately threaten the native way of life. “Such reporting is not only wrong; it is also dishonest. Migrants often bring enormous benefits to their adopted countries.” Download the full report HERE"
2015-11-05T20:05:28Z,Diane Abbott: economic migrants and refugees deserve equal sympathy,"Economic migrants coming to Britain should be treated with the same sympathy as refugees fleeing war, Diane Abbott has said. The shadow international development secretary also said it is wrong and racist to claim, as some of her colleagues in the Labour party had done previously, that eastern European immigrants were the cause of wage cuts for English workers. Abbott was speaking on Thursday at an event to welcome refugees in north London also attended by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The refugee and immigration issue is likely to be controversial as Labour seeks to defeat a Ukip challenge in next month’s Oldham West byelection, triggered by the death of Michael Meacher. She said: “I would remind you, thousands of people crossing the Sahara, risking their lives in the Mediterranean, coming over the Balkans, are also economic migrants and we do not want to fall into the error of thinking that refugees are in some sense a class of migrant more deserving of our sympathy. “Just as our hearts goes out to Syrians struggling, dying, suffering and drowning, our hearts should also go out to economic migrants in Nigeria, Eritrea and north Africa, struggling, drowning and suffering. Economic migrants are not a lesser cause.” She said the migration crisis had been caused by problems such as climate change and instability, but “above all there are issues with a series of ill-fated western interventions in Libya, Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East”. The European Union is predicting that there will be as many as 3 million refugees arriving in Europe next year. Without naming any individual, Abbott also criticised “those in the Labour party that seem to want to argue that immigrants are in some sense the cause of our economic woes”. She said: “This is something I deplore. Immigrants in and of themselves do not cause low wages. Predatory employers, deregulated labour markets and weakened trade unions – they cause low wages.” She argued that some people, including members of the Labour party, wrongly contend that the current debate about immigration is not about race by pointing to the fact that eastern Europeans are white. Abbott said: “I would refer them to the toxic anti-Irish racism of the 19th century – the way the Irish were dehumanised and caricatured. Every single allegation made against the eastern Europeans – they were undercutting local labour, they were driving down wages, that they were the cause of the problems of the English working class – every single allegation that you hear made against eastern European migrants today, they said about the Irish in the 19th century. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.” The government’s response to the crisis was inadequate because the refugee conversation had been poisoned by the toxic debate about immigration year after year, she said. Abbott added that it was hypocritical of neoliberals to wring their hands about the effects of eastern Europeans on wages, since it was the liberalisation of labour markets and the weakening of trade unions that were the real culprits. She described Corbyn as “the first authentically leftwing leader of the Labour party in a generation”. Speaking at the event, Corbyn said his success in the Labour leadership election showed “the politics of me, not we, are over”. “It was a victory not for me, but for all those that want to see a different, better and more peaceful world,” he said. He called on Britain to “hold out the hand of humanity and not brutality to refugees. I do not use the language of swarm and swamp and all those things. I look at those people as fellow human beings, just like you, just like me, just doing their best to survive in a cruel and dangerous world”. Corbyn said David Cameron’s pledge to take in up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years was inadequate, pointing to the hundreds of thousands being granted asylum by Germany and urging the government to assist local councils in giving a place of safety to refugees in the UK. He insisted he held no brief for those fighting in Syria, and said he only wanted peace in the region. “Further bombing, further interventions, further boots on the ground, further wars is not going to solve the problem. All wars have to end by a political solution,” Corbyn added. Without specifying how many refugees the British government should take, the Labour leader pointed out that Germany has taken hundreds of thousands of refugees and Britain should be doing more. He said: “Refugees should not be treated as a problem, a threat, a difficulty and somehow or other to be confronted and kept out.“The problem across Europe will not be solved by the construction of razor-wire fences around countries, by having gun boats in the sea and by having electronic surveillance and tagging of people all across the world that are trying to achieve a place of safety.” The solution lay “in greater equality and above all by ending the series of wars that have disfigured this century so far,” Corbyn added."
2015-12-22T12:43:53Z,"Over a million migrants and refugees have reached Europe this year, says IOM","More than a million people have now reached Europe through irregular means in 2015, the International Organisation for Migration has announced, in what constitutes the continent’s biggest wave of mass migration since the aftermath of the second world war. Out of a total of 1,005,504 arrivals by 21 December, the vast majority – 816,752 – arrived by sea in Greece, the IOM said. A further 150,317 arrived by sea in Italy, with much smaller figures for Spain, Malta and Cyprus. A total of 34,215 crossed by land routes, such as over the Turkish-Bulgarian border. The overall figure is a four-fold increase from 2014’s figures, and has largely been driven by Syrians fleeing their country’s civil war. Afghans, Iraqis and Eritreans fleeing conflict and repression are the other significant national groups. The European migration flow is nevertheless far more manageable than in the Middle East, where roughly 2.2 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey alone. In Lebanon, 1.1 million Syrians form about one-fifth of the country’s total population, while Jordan’s 633,000 registered Syrian refugees make up around a tenth of the total. The denial of basic rights to refugees in those countries, where almost all Syrians do not have the right to work, is one of the causes of Europe’s migration crisis. Refugees who have lived for several years in legal limbo are now coming to Europe to claim the rights bestowed on them by the 1951 UN refugee convention. “In Jordan, life is so difficult,” said Nemer, a 24-year-old Syrian student, minutes after landing this week on the Greek island of Lesbos. “There’s no [legal] work. I can’t go to university. There’s no hope. And in Turkey it’s the same thing: no work and no hope.” Other refugees are fleeing directly from the war zones themselves. Aruba al-Rifai, a 44-year-old civil servant from the outskirts of Damascus, arrived on Lesbos this week having come straight from Syria. “The bombs are getting worse, and it’s just the beginning,” said Rifai. “I come to Europe to feel like a human being.” Among rights workers, Tuesday’s news prompted renewed calls for Europe to set up safe and legal access to refugees. Save the Children, which says that over a quarter of refugee arrivals to Europe this year have been minors, said the absence of a more humanitarian response meant that the values of the continent were now at risk. “Despite many European countries and people generously helping one million refugees, Europe is doing too little to protect and help vulnerable refugee children and stop families drowning on our shores,” said Kirsty McNeill, the charity’s campaigns director. “This is the test of our European ideal. When children are dying on our doorstep we need to take bolder action. There can be no bigger priority.” Among other demands, McNeill also called for better provision for refugees once they arrive in Europe. “Some reception facilities, especially at borders, aren’t adequately providing for basic needs like food, water or healthcare,” McNeill said in a statement. “The situation is expected to worsen with the onset of winter – especially for children -who are also more vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, violence and trafficking. We urge European states to focus on immediate humanitarian needs on the ground, especially for children.” The record movement of people into Europe is a symptom of a record level of disruption around the globe, with numbers of refugees and internally displaced people far surpassing 60 million, UNHCR said last week. “I don’t understand why people are insisting that this is a European problem. This is a global issue,” Michael Moller, director of the UN office in Geneva, told a news conference on Tuesday. The UN refugee chief Antonio Guterres called on Friday for a “massive resettlement” of Syrian and other refugees within Europe, to distribute many hundreds of thousands of people before the continent’s asylum system crumbles. He called for European countries to recognise the positive contributions made by refugees and migrants and to honour what he said were “core European values: protecting lives, upholding human rights and promoting tolerance and diversity.” Lesbos is now the main refugee gateway to Europe, with just under half of those entering the continent in 2015 doing so by using the island as a staging post between the Greek mainland and the nearby shores of Turkey. Despite the worsening weather, and despite a so-called crackdown on Turkey’s people-smugglers, the numbers arriving in December are still higher than in June and July. Over 15 boats arrived on Lesbos on Monday. Across the Greek islands, the average number of refugees arriving each day in December is 3,338, lower than the October peak of 6,828, but far higher than July’s 1,771. The IOM data is the latest in a slew of different and sometimes contradictory figures being used to quantify the European migration crisis. Other sources include the UN refugee agency, which is not publicly monitoring land arrivals; Frontex, the EU border agency, which sometimes double-counts people; and Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, whose data conflates numbers from the refugee crisis with those that refer to internal European migration. Between 12 and 14 million Europeans are estimated to have been displaced in the aftermath of the second world war."
2015-08-28T15:51:21Z,"Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers: what's the difference?","In the current migration crisis, the terms “migrant”, “refugee” and less commonly “asylum seeker” are used daily to mean one and the same thing. Each term, however, has a distinct meaning that carries different international obligations and consequences. If conflated, it can mean the difference between life and death. So what are thoe differences? Migrant At its simplest, a migrant is someone who moves from one place to another in order to live in another country for more than a year. The International Organisation of Migration estimates that 232 million people a year become international migrants and another 740 million move within their own countries. The are many reasons that people become migrants, but those who move to work or seek a better life are generally termed economic migrants. There are, however, also international students, those who move for family reasons and those who migrate because they are fleeing war and persecution. An individual case can be a mixture of all those things. It is, after all, possible to flee the war in Syria and want a better life for your family. Migrants from outside the EU are subject to immigration controls and may need a visa to enter certain countries, including Britain. They do not have immediate access to social housing or benefits, but may have an eventual pathway to settlement and citizenship. They can also be detained or deported if they fail to comply with immigration laws. Just over 636,000 migrants arrived in Britain in the past 12 months, according to the latest figures, which included 25,000 asylum seekers. Once migrants arrive in a country such as Britain there is little agreement over what the word covers. In the past “immigrant” has meant someone who intends to settle in a new country. “Migrant” has been increasingly adopted to cover those who come to work for a short period then return home. “The migrant population” is used to describe foreign nationals resident in a country, but also those who are foreign-born residents even if they have become citizens. Refugee A refugee is a person who has fled armed conflict or persecution and who is recognised as needing of international protection because it is too dangerous for them to return home. They are protected under international law by the 1951 refugee convention, which defines what a refugee is and outlines the basic rights afforded to them. The convention’s basic principle is that refugees should not be expelled or returned to situations where their life and freedom would be under threat. Once someone has been recognised as a refugee, they are supposed to be given access to social housing and welfare benefits and helped to find a job and integrate into society. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that there are almost 60 million forcibly displaced people around the world, including those displaced within their own countries. Asylum seeker States are under international obligation to consider claims for asylum and not to immediately return asylum seekers to the countries they have fled from. The refugee convention states that they must be given access to fair and efficient asylum procedures and measures to ensure they live in dignity and safety while their claims are processed. In the UK in practice this means living in no-choice accommodation outside London and south-east England on a minimal level of social security."
2015-09-04T08:20:59Z,"Refugees are Australia's most entrepreneurial migrants, says research","Refugees are not taking Australian jobs, they are creating new ones, according to new government research that reveals humanitarian arrivals are the country’s most entrepreneurial migrants. People from the UK and India – most of whom arrived on skilled or family visas – contributed the largest share of the $38bn earned by migrants in Australia in 2009-10, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released on Friday, reveals. But it was migrants who arrived as refugees who reported the highest proportion of their incomes that year “from their own unincorporated businesses”. This income grew with the length of time they spent in Australia, and “increased sharply” after five years of residency. The report built on earlier research showing humanitarian migrants tended to work several jobs in their first few years in Australia to build capital to start their own businesses, the ABS said. One such entrepreneur is Bassam Jabbar, who recently arrived from Iraq, and with the help of Settlement Services International (SSI), has established a glass-etching artwork business. He told Guardian Australia the biggest hurdle to starting a business was “knowing the country, knowing how people think, the regulations”. “Refugees have left their country, their society, their language behind and so of course they find it easier to work in their own business – especially artists,” he said. Nearly 10% of humanitarian migrants’ incomes in 2009-10 were generated by their own businesses, almost twice the figure recorded in other categories, such as skilled and family migrants. This income was overwhelmingly made by men, most aged between 25 and 44. Afghans earned the largest share of the profits generated by humanitarian migrant businesses. Violet Roumeliotis, the chief executive of SSI, said she “wasn’t surprised at all” by the data. “Being from countries where they need to be enterprising to survive, because there’s no welfare state, refugees are keen to pick an area of passion or where they have a skill and start a business,” she said."
2015-09-16T18:21:55Z,Refugee crisis escalates as migrants break through Hungarian border,"Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war entered a new phase on Wednesday as hundreds of trapped refugees briefly broke through a border gate on the now-blocked Hungarian border, leading to frenzied clashes with Hungarian police, while hundreds of others forged a new route through Croatia. Hungarian riot police fired teargas and water cannon across the border with Serbia after frustrated crowds, who had gathered there in their thousands when Hungary closed its frontier on Tuesday, tried to burst through a gate that connects the two countries. Hungary’s actions were met with fury by the Serbian government, which said its northern neighbours had no right to fire into Serbian territory. Serbia’s prime minister accused Hungary of “brutal” and “non-European” behaviour and urged the European Union to respond. “We will not allow anyone to humiliate us. I call on the European Union to react, for its members to behave in line with European values,” Aleksandar Vucic told Serbian state television. “If the EU does not react, we will find a way to protect our borders and European values as well,” he said. Amnesty International reported that at least seven children had been injured in the chaos, one sustaining a head wound and another blinded by pepper spray. Hungary said 20 policemen had been hurt. An official said they had detained 29 migrants during clashes and described one of them as an “identified terrorist”, without expanding further. Tensions boiled over after thousands of refugees fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan began arriving at the Horgoš border crossing between Serbia and Hungary in the hours after Budapest finally sealed it following months of threats to do so. For many refugees, whose understanding of how to navigate Europe is largely gleaned from the more than 170,000 people who had successfully transited through Hungary since the start of the year, the move came as a shock. Frustrations were amplified further when a handful of Syrians who were subsequently allowed into Hungary to claim asylum had their applications rejected within minutes, seemingly without a proper assessment of their individual cases and backgrounds. The tipping point came after an Iraqi refugee, one of 60 who was caught trying to breach the new border fence in separate incidents on Tuesday, was convicted in a specially convened Hungarian court. He was the first to be prosecuted under new Hungarian laws enacted this week that criminalise the act of crossing the fence. A few hours after his expedited conviction, a few miles to the south of the courthouse in Horgoš, crowds kicked in the gate to the official border crossing. Documenting the scenes on the ground, Amnesty’s head of crisis response, Tirana Hassan, said the chaos was an indictment of Europe’s unjust response to the refugee crisis, which governments have largely tried to contain with a series of border closures rather than offering refugees safe and free passage to the continent. “Things are at boiling point,” Hassan said as a wounded woman was carried past her. “This is a clear message that Hungary and the EU need to find real solutions to the refugee crisis. Keeping people in limbo will only make it worse.” A temporary pressure valve emerged on Wednesday on Serbia’s border with Croatia, after Croatia’s prime minister, Zoran Milanović, condemned Hungary’s border closure and promised to help speed the flow of refugees through his country if necessary. “We are ready to accept and direct those people,” Milanović said, claiming that people “will be able to pass through Croatia and we are working intensively to enable that”. Serbia then began bussing refugees arriving at its southern border with Macedonia straight to the town of Šid, close to its western border with Croatia. Others headed there by public bus and taxi from the Hungarian border, and by mid-afternoon a steady of flow of people were marching through the flat farmland from Šid towards Croatia. The Croatian police were waiting for them, with vans parked in the fields ready to drive refugees into Tovarnik, the first town on the Croatian side. In what has become a familiar, harrowing scene, there were old men limping through the fields, parents walking with children on their shoulders, and a woman in a wheelchair. Some admitted they were entering an unknown, just as the first few Syrians who crossed into Hungary a year ago did so without knowledge of whether it would work. While Croatia said it would aid people’s transit, Slovenia – the next country along the route – said it would make people apply for asylum, even though it is not a desired destination for most refugees. For its part, the Hungarian government said it could build another border fence along its shared border with Croatia. The final domino to fall was Austria, which lies beyond Slovenia and whose government said it could implement border checks along its Slovenian border. To add to the uncertainty, Croatian mine experts warned that there remained around 2 sq km of live landmines on the Serbian border. Miljenko Vahtaric, assistant director at the Croatia Mine Action Centre, told the Guardian: “We have marked all these areas on our maps – but unfortunately refugees don’t have any means to get these maps. So there is always the possibility that somebody could enter these suspected hazardous areas and get wounded or even killed.” Confronted with these myriad problems, refugees walking into Croatia said it was worth the risk. “We just heard about this route,” said Mohamed Ahmed, a 26-year-old Syrian doctor from Deir Ezzor, as he strode towards Croatia with his older sister Noor and younger brother Ali. “We thought we should check it out immediately, see if it is a route or not. It’s not difficult for people who are fleeing from terrible conditions to do it.” A few hundred metres behind him, Ahmed Riad, a 58-year-old Iraqi from Islamic State-controlled Samarrat, limped along in flip-flops. He first went to Croatia as a tourist in 1982, and remembered the blue buildings of the university. Now, 33 years later, he was returning as a refugee, and his first sight was a thin blue line of police. “The police are waiting for us?” Riad asked his friends. “Will they send us back?” And without knowing the answer, he walked across the latest frontier of the European migration crisis, into Croatia. “It’s terrible,” were his last words before leaving Serbia, after being asked his opinion on Europe’s treatment of refugees. “They must accept us. They must help us.”"
2015-09-03T13:54:52Z,Cameron must help refugees and bin the economic migrant label,"When it comes to refugees David Cameron has a record of not rushing into a response in the face of a public outcry that more must be done. When in January 2014 the UN launched an appeal, backed by 25 charities including Oxfam and Amnesty International, to take part in a large-scale programme to resettle 30,000 people fleeing Syria, it was weeks before Cameron responded. When he did, he declined to take part in the UN programme, saying it would be tokenistic given the huge number of refugees. Instead he stepped up Britain’s aid programme to help refugees in the region and set up a separate vulnerable persons relocation scheme, which prioritised victims of sexual violence, elderly and disabled people and victims of torture. As of June, only 215 people have come to Britain under this scheme. In April, the refugee crisis came to a new head during the general election, when hundreds of people drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean. Their plight provoked a new public outcry but it was not until after the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, had demanded that Britain should help pluck them from the sea that Cameron ordered the Royal Navy to take part. Unfortunately, no major Royal Navy ship is involved any longer in proactive search and rescue operations. So what considerations are involved in Cameron’s stance on taking more refugees? The government rightly points out that it has been the second largest aid donor in the world, after the US, committing more than £900m to help the 4 million UN-registered refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and neighbouring countries by providing food rations and other help. In July, Justine Greening, the international development minister, insisted the policy was working because “only 2% of the 11 million displaced Syrians have sought asylum in Europe”. But the latest flows of desperate people show that the conditions in those camps have become so unbearable that it is no longer a solution. What about responding to the demands of the Germans, Italians and French for Britain to share the responsibility for relocating around Europe those refugees who have made it across the Mediterranean and had their claims for asylum recognised? Britain has refused repeated requests to take part in two EU schemes: the first to relocate over the next two years 40,000 of those who have made it to Europe, and the second, more modest, scheme to resettle 20,000 refugees from the Middle East and north Africa around Europe. Theresa May has insisted that opening up such legal routes to protection will only act as a “pull factor” encouraging more people to come. The greatest pressure Britain will face within Europe in the build-up to the crucial EU interior ministers’ meeting on 14 September will be to participate in the two schemes. The decisions by Germany and Sweden to suspend the Dublin convention and open their doors to asylum seekers regardless of having reached another EU country first has intensified the pressure. The problem with being flexible is that Cameron has insisted most of those trying to cross the Mediterranean are not people fleeing wars but economic migrants seeking a bigger life. The distinction makes a big difference, because even Britain recognises that refugees must be given international protection and help to settle while economic migrants can be sent back to where they came from. In this crisis Britain has argued most strongly for the registration, fingerprinting and processing of asylum claims of those who make it across the Mediterranean, with a view to rapidly return those whose claims are rejected. On Sunday, May signed a letter with the French and Germans, calling for “hotspot” processing centres in Italy and Greece, an EU-wide list of countries it is safe to return rejected asylum seekers to and a for a rapid returns programme. The Germans are keen that a number of Balkan countries, including Kosovo, Albania and Serbia are on the list as they account for a significant slice of the 800,000 asylum applications they anticipate this year. Britain would also like licence to rapidly return Albanians who feature strongly in UK asylum applications. But all the evidence shows that most of those crossing the Mediterranean are refugees not asylum seekers. EU statistics show that 94% of the Syrians who make it to Europe are given official refugee status, 88% of Iraqis are recognised as refugees, 90% of Eritreans and 66% of Afghans. If they can make it, they will get help, but as the recent scenes at Calais show, getting into Britain to claim asylum is a lot more difficult than it might appear. Cameron, however, will need to drop his claim that most people trying to come to Britain are economic migrants rather than refugees to do more to help them. Some voices have started to demand that Britain should only take more unaccompanied children or victims of sexual violence. Well, the existing UK vulnerable persons relocation scheme already prioritises women who have been victims of rape in Syria, and the suggestion of only helping the orphaned children ignores the fact that we already officially recognise that even the most able-bodied adult male Syrian deserves our protection if only they could reach Britain. The danger is that while Britain has a tradition of humanitarian protection it also has a longer tradition of solving these questions by military means as well, whether in this case it means using the Navy to seize the smugglers’ boats or bombing Syria - both of which options Cameron is also considering."
2015-09-19T19:23:08Z,Refugee crisis: young migrants blaze new trails through Europe,"When the refugee route to the European Union swerved west into Croatia last week, some of the first people to blaze the trail were the three Ahmed siblings from Deir Ez-zor. After Hungary, the gateway to Europe for more than 170,000 refugees this year, closed its border on Tuesday, thousands of the Ahmeds’ compatriots simply stayed put, unsure of where to go next. But Mohamed, Noor and Ali Ahmed didn’t waste time. After just one day, they paid for a taxi to the last Serbian town before Croatia, and then began marching through the flat farmland that stretches across the Serbo-Croatian border. The eldest, Mohamed, a 26-year-old doctor, admitted they had no idea of what to expect. “We just heard about this route,” added Ahmed. “We thought we should check it out immediately, see if it is a route or not.” It’s impossible to say how refugees collectively shift direction, or to specify which of them are most responsible for forging or popularising a new path. But the fastest movers, and the most daring (or foolhardy) decision makers, are often small groups of mobile twenty-somethings like the Ahmeds. When the Hungarian route was first used by sizable numbers of Syrians late last summer, the first accounts of the trip on Facebook appeared to be written by young people for other young people. “Wear nice clothes, hair gel, and perfume,” advised one page that offered early tips on how people could enter Hungary. There was nothing on how to do it with children. When that route finally closed last week, the last people to give up on it were the large families who waited in hope at the border gates, even after most others had left to take a punt on Croatia. “We will stay here until we hear that Croatia is a safe route,” said a cautious Kawa Uso, a Kurd travelling with his extended family. If you’re not trying to carry several children across a continent, you can move faster and take more risks, explains Zahraa Daoud, a 23-year-old trying to navigate Croatia last week with a group of similarly aged friends. “It’s much better this way,” says Daoud, a Syrian literature student. “We’re all young guys and girls, we’re all healthy, we can walk and run and do anything.” For Nooreddine Hamed, a 38-year-old Syrian engineer, every calculation he makes along the route is that much harder because he has five children with him. “It’s much slower,” Hamed says. “Your children have luggage, not just you. And you have to look after them. They need more rests and toilet breaks.” His family left home in Syria two weeks ago, a week before Daoud. Now both groups are at the same place in the trail, and the Hameds are about to get overtaken again. “The crowds we walk with change all the time because we go so slowly,” Hamed says. Much has been made of the refugees’ hive-mind on social media, the sharing of information on Facebook and WhatsApp between those who have successfully made it to northern Europe, and those in their wake. Social media helps to explain how the Hungarian route went from being a niche in 2014 to a full-on refugee superhighway this year. The more the word spread about the trail – and the more tips that were shared about routes, smugglers and tactics – the more it became a viable option. However, what last week’s events have shown is that there are limits to the speed at which the hive-mind works. Information can only be shared as long as people have the internet. And as they hop between countries, most refugees get online only fleetingly. So the news that Hungary had closed its border took a while to reach people. Even on Thursday, more than two days after it was shut, refugees were still arriving there, shocked that the path was now blocked. “Are you sure?” asked one late Syrian arrival, Alaa Eddine, after being informed that Hungary was closed. “This is the route they told me to come.” With no Facebook groups or successful refugees to call on, people have had to rely on other methods of information gathering – a process that takes longer, and is more uncertain. In the absence of a new known route, Daoud says she started asking UN officials and local policemen. “You don’t just ask one policeman,” says Daoud. “You’re looking for the policeman who says, ‘Don’t tell anyone I’m telling you, but you should do this …’ ” Others rely on smugglers to plan the route. Interviewed earlier this summer in Serbia, an Afghan surgeon described how he had paid a smuggling network around €10,000 to plan every stage of the journey for him. “Sometimes they give me GPS, sometimes they give me a map, sometimes they send me a car,” said Yama Nayab, who fled Afghanistan with his family after being stabbed near the heart. Last week, even the smugglers were struggling. Asked about possible alternative routes through Croatia, one Belgrade-based smuggler initially seemed surprised. Others kept taking refugees to the Hungarian border, even after it was closed. In the end, it was an intervention from the Serbian government that ultimately forced the biggest change in the European migration route since last year. After the Hungarian government was unmoved by requests to reopen its border, Serbia simply began bussing people entering from Macedonia in the south to Croatia in the west. It was a decision that most refugees didn’t properly understand. One asked if they were going to have to cross another sea. “What’s the name of this country?” asked a second man, 40-year-old Ali Sadoun from Iraq. “Croatia?”"

2015-07-27T11:57:49Z,"These are refugees, not migrants, arriving in their thousands on Greek shores | Kirk Day","As I stood in the middle of the squalid Kara Tepe transit camp on Lesbos, I was struck by the utter perverseness of the refugee drama unfolding on this Greek island. I was supporting a flash-mob of local volunteers and tourists – supported by local officials – to clean the camp, which is now a temporary home for 3,000 refugees. Litter was everywhere – and posing a health risk. The selflessness and dedication of the local volunteers, who have been responding to the crisis virtually unaided for several years, is awe-inspiring. As I picked up the trash under a searing sun, four questions came to my mind, the answers to which should make us all uncomfortable. First, why is the crisis repeatedly referred to by the media and by officials in European capitals as a “migrant” crisis? Here, in Greece, nothing could be further from the truth. According to the most recent figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, of the more than 77,000 arrivals in Greece since the beginning of the year, 85% are refugees. More than 60% of these are fleeing the conflict in Syria, with others escaping continued violence in Afghanistan. Likewise, the majority of people arriving nearby in Italy are fleeing armed conflict in Somalia or conscription in Eritrea. Even among those who are not refugees, many arriving on Europe’s shores are vulnerable for other reasons. Some are unaccompanied children, or victims of sexual trafficking, or have been tortured and traumatised as they made their way across the Sahara to Africa’s Mediterranean coast before eventually reaching Europe. Refugees and other vulnerable people deserve the protection and assistance to which they are entitled under international law. Second, this crisis was not unexpected. For some time, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and others have warned that countries neighbouring conflict areas are reaching their maximum capacity to absorb any more refugees. Without legal alternative routes for refugees to enter other European countries, people fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere have taken matters into their own hands, risking their lives – often on flimsy rubber dinghies across dangerous stretches of the Aegean and Mediterranean – to seek the sanctuary of Europe. With more people displaced by conflict globally than ever before– 59.5 million – Europe has to recognise that this problem is not going away, and that it needs to respond meaningfully to provide help. Third, why has much of the world looked away from the crisis in the Mediterranean? The IRC is built to respond to emergencies in some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden countries. That we have had to deploy an emergency response team to Europe to make sure refugees receive clean water and have access to toilets, rather than defecate in the open, is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in the region. For far, far too long, local Greek officials and volunteers have had to shoulder this burden, and at a time when they have had to endure paralysing austerity measures and the most recent financial crisis. Despite these hardships, the compassion and generosity of local groups has put the international community to shame. And, the refugee crisis in Greece is only likely to get worse. Local officials and aid experts estimate that 200,000 refugees will come to Greece this year. This will undoubtedly overwhelm the primarily local-led relief efforts. Europe also needs to provide more support to Greece so that it can provide a humane and dignified reception for refugees. When they arrive on Lesbos, refugees are not provided with medical check-ups or other assistance, aside from that provided by community volunteers. Until very recently, refugees often walked 40 miles, often in 32C (90F) heat, from the northern coast where they landed to the Kara Tepe transit camp. This is simply cruel. Fourth, why have European members states continued the ongoing asylum charade, forcing refugees to further risk their lives by requiring them to furtively travel to their desired asylum destinations? Europe’s asylum policies mean that a refugee has to apply for asylum in the country where he or she first arrives, which for those coming from Libya and Turkey almost always means Italy or Greece. Desperate to rejoin family members in other European countries or to live where there are real job prospects, many people avoid registration and continue their journeys illegally. Would it not be more humane to allow these vulnerable groups to seek asylum at European embassies in Athens, or better yet, in European embassies in their home regions? Or at the very least ensure safe passage to their desired onward destinations – often to be reunited with waiting family members? As it stands, refugees who reach Greece are then forced to travel through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to other destinations in Europe, a route making them vulnerable to human traffickers, gangs and corrupt officials. Ultimately, at what point do we all conclude that these people have already suffered enough and deserve to be aided in their flight to safety? At the International Rescue Committee, we have already made this decision. Kirk Day is the International Rescue Committee’s emergency field director in Lesbos."
2015-11-19T14:09:16Z,Aid groups say Balkan states blocking refugees based on nationality,"Countries along the Balkan migration trail have begun refusing to admit people of certain nationalities, amid a backlash against refugees in the aftermath of the Paris attacks last Friday. Humanitarian workers active along the borders of Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia reported that refugees and migrants from countries other than Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq were now being stopped, raising the spectre of a migrant logjam in Greece. The move comes after Slovenia, the most northerly country along the trail, suddenly tried to return 168 Moroccan migrants to Croatia on Thursday, in the first major development along the Balkan migration route since Hungary shut its border in September. The decision sparked panic among the countries to Slovenia’s south, who feared that Slovenia was about to block access to anyone who could not easily prove their need for refugee status, and consequently turned back all migrants from Africa and southern Asia. Slovenia said on Thursday afternoon it had not made any permanent decisions, and promised to admit refugees as long as Germany and Austria continued to subsequently take them. But a police spokesman confirmed that Slovenia would discuss with its Balkan neighbours how to limit the flow of so-called economic migrants in the future. “We absolutely need to provide protection to those who need it, whose lives are threatened, who are escaping war zones,” said a spokesman for the Slovenian interior ministry. “For others we will need to reach an agreement on how to respond. No country has limitless capacity, so the capacity should be for those whose lives are really in need.” For now, campaigners on the ground said people from Africa, Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh – who collectively amount to less than 10% of the flow through the Balkans, according to the UN – were already trapped in limbo at the borders of Croatia, Serbia, and Macedonia, since the three countries did not want to risk the possibility of anyone being stuck on their territory. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Macedonia had begun to build a barrier along its southern border with Greece. A spokeswoman for the Macedonian interior ministry denied any such barrier was being built, but MSF’s team leader on the border said it was clear that some kind of obstacle was being constructed. “It’s obvious that they want to do something,” said MSF’s Antonis Rigas. “Every 20 metres they’ve put out stones. What for? They haven’t started the construction, but I’m an engineer, and I can say it’s there for something.” Earlier in the week, Macedonia’s cabinet said it was considering whether to build a fence. But it claimed that such a fence, if built, would be used to block the passage of migrants only if upstream countries did the same, risking a bottleneck on Macedonian territory. Serbia has promised not to build a fence, but Slovenia is preparing one in order to better control the flow of refugees. Hungary completed work on a fence in mid-September, causing the refugee route to swerve westwards into Croatia. Should the Balkan countries block the route entirely, Greece may be forced to deal with a logjam of refugees. An average of 4,750 people a day have arrived on its shores from Turkey this month, down from the October average of 6,800 but above the August daily rate of 3,500. Though their problems have received less attention than those of Syrians, many refugees from Africa and south Asia claim to be fleeing human rights abuses. A backlash against migrants and refugees has intensified after a passport used by a migrant to enter Greece in early October was found near the body of a dead bomber in Paris. Police are not yet sure whether the passport holder was a the terrorist. But the uncertainty has led to fears about the threat posed by thousands of undocumented migrants entering Europe’s south-eastern borders, some of whom carry fake documentation. A spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the Balkan countries risked failing to uphold the UN convention on refugees should they begin to screen arrivals on the basis of their origin. “It is important that every individual who is seeking asylum has access to a fair and efficient asylum procedure, regardless of their nationality,” the spokeswoman said. “UNCHR is monitoring the situation and recommending governments that each case is decided based on its predicaments not on the nationality of the asylum seeker. All countries along the Balkans route are signatories to the 1951 convention and UNHCR has been working with the government to build their asylum systems.” Over 600,000 people have so far attempted to walk through the Balkans after landing in Greece in 2015."
2015-10-13T16:02:02Z,From suffering to detention: why does the US put asylum seekers behind bars? | Crystal Vance Guerra and  Gabriel M Schivone,"Middle Eastern and African asylum seekers are languishing in US detention centers – completely removed from the political radar. Despite increased attention in recent years over the plight of undocumented people and the Obama administration’s deportation boom, detainees from Africa and the Middle East are often forgotten. The incarceration of some now even borders on indefinite detention. Hisham is one of them. “I am finished from here,” he said over the phone on September 1. Speaking in broken English, Hisham, an Arab migrant, was calling to notify one of us, Gabriel, his immigration sponsor, that a major Western government just denied his plea for humanitarian asylum. The often cheerful young man had taken a sinuous journey over ocean, jungles and deserts halfway across the world – detained by multiple governments along the way – to escape persecution and poverty. Though it may sound like it, this globe-trekking migrant wasn’t calling from an aid shelter in Eastern Europe, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have arrived, fleeing violence and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. He was calling from a cluster of large detention centers in Southern Arizona run or contracted out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). An undocumented Palestinian from Gaza, Hisham’s indirect route to the Arizona detention center included roughly a year cooped up in a Cypriot refugee camp before being sent to Venezuela. From there, speaking little-to-no Spanish, he and his travel companion, Mounis, also from Gaza, traveled north to the Arizona/Mexico border trudging several thousand miles through Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. Hisham and Mounis aren’t an anomaly. Right now, according to data provided to us by Ice spokesperson Virginia Kice, as of 5 September the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is keeping 1,387 undocumented African and Middle Easterners from 22 countries in detention facilities across the US. By far, the highest number of migrants hail from countries convulsing from armed conflict and economic destabilization over recent years, in large part thanks to US foreign and economic policy. A review of the top origin-countries for those detained reads like a checklist of the migrants making up the European immigration crisis: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, Eritrea, Somalia and so on. Among the lowest numbers of detainees on the list hail from the Persian Gulf countries where there’s plenty of state control and repression but relatively stable, lucrative economies. Ice has taken custody of the detainees because they are undocumented, transferred from local police custody in the US interior or apprehended by Border Patrol along the nation’s northern or southern borders. The detainees remain in Ice custody for an undefined period of days or weeks until deportation or release. Hisham and Mounis, however, have been detained for 11 months. Without any set release or deportation date now that his asylum case has been denied, Hisham’s imprisonment in particular now pushes towards indefinite detention. Of the more than 1,300 Middle Eastern and African migrants in custody as of last month, Ice Spokesperson Kice speculates: “Probably most of them are violent criminal offenders …” But asylum sponsors like Gabriel have met many asylum applicants over the years, all of them without criminal histories, so we are skeptical of this broad-stroke claim labeling them as violent criminals. According to the US government lawyer at a bond hearing this past May, Hisham himself “lacks a criminal history and doesn’t pose a danger” to US society. Hisham and Mounis joined a swelling migration flow from the Middle East and Africa in recent years. The rates of Middle Eastern and African migrants moving through Mexico have increased nearly 400% from 306 in 2011 to 1,152 as of June 2015, according to data provided by Mexican immigration authorities. US Border Patrol apprehensions of migrants from the same 22 countries referred to above also reflects this migration flow. As of August, 209 of these migrants were held in short-term Border Patrol custody on their way to ICE. This number is down slightly from 250 in 2014 but still higher than the 194 apprehensions in 2013. This sort of apprehension data is often a crude, least-of-all estimate of total undocumented populations present in the country. And it suggests the desperate measures that so many migrants like Hisham and Mounis, left without any other option, take to enter the US. Their odyssey-like migrations, riddled with obstacles, highlight both the inaccessibility and inadequacy of the refugee aid offered to these migrants in the US. So why isn’t the White House talking about these refugees now in detention? The Obama administration has only mentioned those formally conferred refugee status, referred by overseas agencies; not those already lingering here in immigration enforcement limbo. The administration should satisfactorily explain why these migrant detainees are being held. There’s enough evidence to demand that the Obama administration urgently review their cases in view of a migration crisis that not only continues worsening in Eastern Europe. It’s also stoking a detention crisis of refugees ignored in the US. Obama granting emergency stays to undocumented, non-criminal Middle Eastern/African people currently in detention, who also fled persecution and violence, are just as necessary as his pledges to raise refugee acceptance rates in the future. Concrete measures like these would show the world that the US can better directly start doing its part to aid those in need, regardless of whether they fled after or before the world started noticing their straits. The day Hisham arrived at the US-Mexico border, according to his case file, he was asked by the Homeland Security officer who interviewed him why he sought asylum in the United States. Hisham replied: “Because it is a free country and you have the right to live as a human being.” Hisham’s answer could have been the answer of his many migrant counterparts in refugee camps overseas, as well as his neighbors who today remain in Ice facilities across the country. As a nation that claims to believe in human rights, what will Obama’s answer to them be?"
2015-12-11T10:42:07Z,"The media needs to tell the truth on migration, not peddle myths | Alberto Nardelli","Over the past week a lot has been said about the success of the far-right Front National at the French regional elections, while the reaction to Donald Trump’s increasingly discriminatory tone has, rightly, been one mostly of disgust. We are right to stand up to the Le Pens and Trumps of this world. When they splutter remarks that are incendiary and false, we have a responsibility to correct their inaccuracies. The reasons why the ideas of the Front National take hold are plentiful and complicated. There is no single simple explanation. However, there can be no doubt that misinformation does not help – and we in the media should feel a professional and moral obligation to confront our own industry when it misleads. The front page of Thursday’s Times of London splashed: “EU buckles as Merkel’s migrants hit 1 million.” The headline topped an article about comments made by the UK prime minister, David Cameron, who said that net migration of 300,000 a year was not sustainable in Britain. The piece also referenced demands that Cameron is making to other European leaders to apply restrictions to EU nationals’ access to UK’s welfare. The Times story pieces together different stories and conflates a range of issues. The result is a distasteful minestrone. First, the one million figure refers to the number of asylum seekers that have arrived in Germany so far this year. The majority of these are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. They are refugees fleeing wars. Second, whatever one thinks of Britain’s level of migration - whether it is too high or not is besides the point - the number has little to do with refugees. The UK hardly takes any refugees. In fact fewer than 5% of migrants to Britain over the past year were asylum seekers. Third, we can state with certainty that refugees escaping conflict are not doing so to claim in-work tax credits. Fourth, the migrants are Angela Merkel’s only insofar as Germany is one of a handful of countries that is welcoming refugees instead of putting up fences, turning the other way, or, like Britain, taking in pitifully low numbers. The problem with the article is more than just a question of interpretation or of cavalier use of terms. Facts without humanity are meaningless. The choice of words we use matters and carries consequences. Behind the use of words like “migrant”, “refugee”, “asylum seeker”, “people”, “swarms” and “floods”, there is powerful symbolism. When terms used for people fleeing war, violence and atrocities, or those used for people moving in search of work, or a better life, become pejorative and generate antipathy, we have a problem. We are choosing not to unite around a shared purpose, but to drive a wedge through society. We are taking an us v them view on the world. There are grave risks when the perception of an issue and facts do not align. It doesn’t matter if the misalignment creates the idea of a country that isn’t grounded in reality – when untruths are repeated often enough they generate fear among people. In turn this defines and drives behaviour. Consider these facts: Britons believe that 23% of migrants are coming to UK to seek asylum while the actual proportion is less than 5% Nearly 40% of Europeans cite immigration as the issue of most concern facing the EU – more than any other issue. Only a year ago, less than 25% of people said the same. One in two of the British public mention immigration as among the most important issues facing the country. Most Europeans greatly overestimate the proportion of their country’s population that is comprised of migrants. The Times of course is not alone. Nearly every day we read headlines about the true toll of mass migration on UK life, the crisis in our schools, the swarms on our streets, migrants stealing our jobs, draining the NHS and fuelling a surge in crime – all actual headlines. Last week a journalist fabricated a tale in order to be able to claim that he had travelled along a refugee route without a passport. This is how far we have come. The same newspaper that carried that particular story (for which it has apologised), had only weeks earlier controversially led with “1 in 5 Brit Muslim’s sympathy for jihadis”. The point is this: the likes of Le Pen and Trump are not a product of the media. However, too often the media provides them with the ammunition and fertile ground that they require to thrive. Don’t take my word for it. Take Trump’s: During a trip to Europe in the 1930s a young John F Kennedy wrote a letter to a friend. In it he said: “It seems so easy to fall into a distorted view of public affairs based more on personal bias than on informed understanding.” The challenge we face is not new. But it is one that remains not only critical, it is one we have mostly failed to meet. If we want to confront the Le Pens and Trumps of this world then we need to change the way we talk about the people that they vilify."
2015-09-03T17:48:26Z,Migration crisis: Germany presses Europe into sharing refugees,"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, looks set for victory in her campaign to press Europe into a new system of sharing refugees after France caved in to a proposed new quotas system and Brussels unveiled plans to quadruple the number of people spread across most of the EU. In a major policy speech on Europe’s worst migration emergency, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is to table proposals next Wednesday for the mandatory sharing of 160,000 refugees between 25 of the EU’s 28 countries. Britain, Ireland and Denmark are exempted from having to take part, but Dublin has already agreed to participate and David Cameron is under increasing pressure for Britain to pull its weight as the migration crisis escalates with scenes of chaos and misery on Europe’s borders. Berlin and Paris have sought to maintain a common position for weeks, but the French equivocated on the key issue of binding quotas. On Thursday, the president, François Hollande, aligned himself with Merkel’s drive for compulsory EU sharing of refugees. Merkel announced from Switzerland that both sides had agreed a common platform and Hollande said there should be a “permanent and obligatory mechanism” for receiving refugees in the EU. “The president and the chancellor have today decided to forward joint proposals on the organisation of the reception of refugees and a fair sharing in Europe,” said the Élysée Palace. Germany, along with the European commission, has been pushing hard for a new mandatory system since May when Juncker tabled much more modest proposals for the compulsory sharing of 40,000 bona fide asylum-seekers over two years. A summit of EU leaders in June rejected the quotas, saying they could only be voluntary and eventually agreeing to share only 32,000. The east European countries and Spain were the main opponents. Four east European prime ministers are to meet on Friday to consider their positions. Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, reiterated his opposition to quotas in Berlin this week. But the speed of developments on the ground is dictating political responses. Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits as president of the European council, said the EU should agree to share at least 100,000 refugees. In June, he opposed the quotas system. The proposed figures - 100,000 to 160,000 - refer merely to a mandatory quotas system, beyond the much higher numbers of asylum claims that the countries will have to process in any case. Germany alone expects 800,000 this year. There is certain to be a fight over the new policy when EU interior ministers hold an extraordinary session on the migration crisis on 14 September. In Brussels on Thursday, Hungary’s hardline anti-immigrant prime minister, Viktor Orban, said quotas would only encourage more people to head for Europe from the Middle East and Africa. “Quotas is an invitation for those who want to come,” he said. “The moral human thing is to make clear, please don’t come.” But the east Europeans are under intense pressure to fall in with the German line and already Poland and Lithuania are making concessions. There were pitiful scenes in Hungary where migrants thronged Budapest’s main railway station and packed into a train they believed was going to Austria en route to Germany, which has opened its doors unconditionally to refugees from Syria. The train was halted 30km out of Budapest and met by a phalanx of riot police who sought to empty the carriages and march the people to a camp. The Hungarian leader, widely criticised for his anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, went on the offensive in Brussels. He said Europe was in the grip of madness over immigration and refugees and argued that he was defending European Christianity against a Muslim influx. “Everything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,” Orban wrote in Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. “Europe’s response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union’s misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation. Irresponsibility is the mark of every European politician who holds out the promise of a better life to immigrants and encourages them to leave everything behind and risk their lives in setting out for Europe.” He painted the refugee emergency as a crisis between Christianity and Islam, with Hungary on the frontline, erecting razor wire fences to keep people out and defend European civilisation against incomers. “Those arriving have been raised in another religion and represent a radically different culture. Most of them are not Christians, but Muslims,” he said. “This is an important question, because Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity. Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian? There is no alternative and we have no option but to defend our borders ... If Europe does not return to the path of common sense, it will find itself laid low in a battle for its fate.” In Brussels, he invoked Hungary’s partial subjugation by the Ottoman empire in the 17th century as the reason why Hungarians did not want to live alongside Muslims. In Washington, White House press secretary, Josh Earnest said that the European Union “certainly has the capacity” to deal with the refugee crisis and indicated that the US would support its allies with technical expertise – such as from the nation’s Coast Guard – and continue to offer financial assistance to meet humanitarian needs."
2015-09-03T11:30:02Z,Migration crisis: pressure mounts on Cameron over refugees,"David Cameron is facing increased calls for Britain to take more refugees from the war-torn Middle East as the pressure is ratcheted up by a senior UN official, as well as a growing number of Conservative MPs, after the publication of shocking pictures of a drowned Syrian boy. The former Conservative chairwoman Sayeeda Warsi called on Downing Street to relent and take thousands more refugees, but there is no sign yet that Cameron is willing to shift in the face of a public, political and media outcry to change course. Peter Sutherland, the UN special representative on international migration, said while some countries were “massively bearing the burden” of the migration crisis, the UK was among those that could do more. Warsi said Britain must be prepared to be humane by taking further refugees, adding that it should focus on extra help for unaccompanied children as well as victims of sexual violence. Urging Cameron to rethink, she said: “There is no criticism of the government in listening. There is no shame in responding to a humanitarian crisis. What we have seen across the board are calls to think again.” It is expected that both Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, will be giving interviews on Thursday and at the very least there will be a change of tone. In what is likely to be the tip of the iceberg, a number of Tory MPs urged a more flexible stance. Tom Tugendhat, Conservative MP for Tonbridge, said on Twitter: “I’ve spoken to many in west Kent who want us to do more and I agree with them. Our common humanity demands action at home and abroad.” But he has also recognised the complexity of the position and the possibility that many travelling to Europe are economic migrants. David Burrowes, MP for Enfield and vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, said the government “should accept thousands, not hundreds”, adding “at the very least we should accept 1% of refugees because we accept more than 1% responsibility”. His view was echoed at the weekend by Johnny Mercer, a former soldier and MP for Plymouth Moor View. He said: “Mothers trying to keep their children afloat on a lifeboat should not think Britain will turn its back. You do not choose where you are born and we should use that to do what we can.” Nadhim Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, tweeted: “We are nothing without compassion. Pic should make us all ashamed. We have failed in Syria. I am sorry little angel. RIP.” The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, tweeted: Nicola Blackwood, the Conservative MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said Britain had a proud record of providing sanctuary to those fleeing conflict. “We cannot be the generation that fails this test of humanity,” she tweeted. By 12.30pm more than 140,000 people had signed a petition to parliament asking MPs to “accept more asylum seekers and increase support for refugee migrants in the UK”. It claims: “The UK is not offering proportional asylum in comparison with European counterparts. We can’t allow refugees who have risked their lives to escape horrendous conflict and violence to be left living in dire, unsafe and inhumane conditions in Europe.” A petition that exceeds more than 100,000 has to be considered by parliament for debate, although in practice MPs are bound to debate the crisis in any case, probably in the form of a government statement on Monday when the Commons returns from its summer recess. However, a Downing Street source, while accepting the image of a dead boy on a Turkish beach was shocking, continued to suggest the government did not believe taking a few thousand refugees would solve the crisis. The UK has taken over 200 vulnerable refugees in the past year and granted asylum to 5,000 Syrians since 2011. Downing Street pointed out that the UK had been at the forefront of providing aid to the refugee camps on the borders of Syria. Speaking on BBC2’s Newsnight, SutherIand said the crisis demanded a united response from Europe’s leaders and that Britain needed to play its part. “I think that this country can do more. The only way to solve this problem is by a united European response and that means sharing responsibility for appalling suffering,” he said. “This is a humanitarian crisis that Europe has not experienced in our time of a dimension which demands a common response. “At the moment it is true to say that a number of countries are massively bearing the burden of this.” While Sutherland said Germany, Sweden, France and Italy were among those doing their bit, the government spokesman insisted the UK was also playing its part. “These photos are clearly shocking. This is why we continue to be at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria – including as the second biggest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid, having already pledged £900m,” the spokesman said. “In addition to this financial support, we have granted protection to almost 5,000 Syrians since the crisis began and continue to tackle the organised trafficking gangs seeking to profit from this human misery.” Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham called for parliament to debate whether the UK should take in more refugees. Burnham urged Cameron to call a debate and vote on the refugee crisis when parliament returns next week. “Over this summer, we have seen an unfolding humanitarian crisis of epic proportions across the Mediterranean and mainland Europe,” he said. “But the response of David Cameron and his ministers has veered from the inadequate to the misjudged. His government’s inaction as the situation has escalated is a stain on our nation’s conscience. “If the prime minister refuses to act, then my first act as leader would be to apply to the Speaker for an emergency debate on the refugee crisis.” His comments came after his Labour leadership rival Yvette Cooper suggested the UK could take 10,000 Syrian refugees. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said the government’s refusal to take more than a few hundred refugees was morally wrong and “politically foolish” while Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: “We must do more.”"
2015-09-02T16:48:59Z,Refugees welcome? How UK and Germany compare on migration,"The numbers More than 4 million refugees have fled Syria since the war there began in 2011. According to the UN’s refugee agency, almost 1.8 million have gone to Turkey, more than 600,000 to Jordan and 1 million to Lebanon – a country whose population is just 4 million. On Monday, Angela Merkel said Germany expected to take at least 800,000 asylum seekers this year. The figure is likely to go up, and could hit 1 million, Berlin says. In 2014 the European nation that accepted the largest number of refugees in proportion to its population was Sweden. Hungary, Malta, Switzerland and 13 other countries accepted more asylum applications than the UK, according to Eurostat. Between June 2014 and June 2015, the UK took 166 Syrian refugees. They were resettled from camps in Jordan and other neighbouring countries under a new government scheme. The “vulnerable persons” relocation initiative began in March 2014. Under it, the UK has taken 216 people. In June David Cameron said the scheme would be “modestly expanded”. The Home Office says that since 2011 almost 5,000 Syrians including family members have been given asylum under normal procedures. However, the figure includes many Syrians who were already living in the UK, and who were unable to return home because of war. Britain is the second biggest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid. It has pledged £900m, the Home Office says. Political conversation There has been relative silence from British ministers over the distressing scenes unfolding across Europe. In an article for the Sunday Times over the weekend, Theresa May, the home secretary, promised a tough new approach to immigration. May coolly referenced “the events of this summer” but didn’t once use the word refugee. Critics say the government is deliberately conflating two separate categories. In a speech this week on the crisis, in which she used the word refugee on 28 occasions, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, accused the Conservatives of “treating immigration and asylum as the same thing when they are completely different”. The government’s target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, which it has repeatedly failed to meet, includes asylum seekers. The government is highly unlikely to adopt a more open approach and is wary of following the example of Germany, where a clear distinction is made between immigration and asylum. The Tories face intense political pressure from Ukip over the large number of migrants from eastern Europe in the wake of the enlargement of the EU in 2004, and are in no mood to make the case for a more measured approach on asylum seekers. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has tried to outmanoeuvre the prime minister by calling for a larger number of Syrian refugees to be accepted. The Refugee Council describes Downing Street’s current rhetoric on asylum as “inaccurate, dangerous and inflammatory”. Asked for examples, it cited David Cameron’s use in July of the phrase “swarm of people” to describe refugees camped out in grim conditions at Calais. On Wednesday the prime minister said taking more refugees wasn’t the answer and talked in vague terms of meeting “big challenges”. The council notes that the number of asylum applications to the UK has flatlined in recent years – there were 24,914 in 2014, a small figure given the world is in the grip of its worst refugee crisis since the second world war. The Refugee Council’s advocacy manager, Anna Musgrave, said: “We have a proud tradition of protecting refugees. We’re not living up to it. It’s extremely disappointing. What’s needed in this country is real leadership on this.” On Tuesday the former foreign secretary David Miliband said Britain should take its fair share of refugees, and complained that the government had misnamed what he said was a refugee crisis, not a migrant crisis. The political conversation in Germany has been markedly different. This week Merkel used the language of shared European ideals and said the continent as a whole had to deal with the problem. “If Europe fails on the question of refugees, its close connection with universal civil rights will be destroyed,” she warned. In July the German chancellor tried to comfort a teenage Palestinian asylum seeker who burst into tears in front of her during a televised debate. This month Merkel was widely criticised for acting too slowly in condemning anti-refugee riots in the Saxon villages of Freital and Heidenau. But after she spoke out, both centre-left and centre-right politicians have largely united around Merkel’s leadership on the issue. For the left, accepting refugees is about solidarity with those fleeing persecution and war. For conservatives there is a pragmatic impetus too: Germany is an ageing society with a shrinking population, and might benefit from an influx of young, highly motivated workers. Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, sister party to Merkel’s CDU, has been the only major party to sound a more critical note. Downing Street is refusing to take part in a new quota system proposed by Berlin, which would see refugees fairly distributed among all 28 EU states. This strategy may entail consequences. German officials have said Cameron has made various demands of fellow EU states before the UK’s referendum on EU membership. These are unlikely to be met if he won’t do more on refugees, they have hinted. Private engagement Thousands of ordinary Germans have volunteered to help the refugees now arriving daily. Some have filled up their cars with shopping, and distributed clothes, nappies, food and cuddly bears. Others have offered German lessons, translation and babysitting. Martin Patzelt, an MP from Merkel’s CDU party, has housed two refugees from Eritrea. They are now living with him temporarily at his home in Brandenburg. In particular, women have offered to help – 70% of those offering services to refugees are female, according to a recent survey. The response has sometimes been overwhelming. A Berlin-based group, Refugees Welcome, which matches refugees with people willing to give them a room, has been flooded with offers. More than 780 Germans have signed up. On Tuesday police at Munich station tweeted the public to stop bringing donations, saying that they had been inundated. In Britain, the refugee crisis has been less acute. There are signs here too, however, of ordinary citizens wanting to contribute. A pro-refugee rally in central London is planned for 12 September, just before the Brussels summit. The organisers said it is vital that May “takes with her the conviction that the British people that she represents are open to helping refugees.” They added: “We can’t continue to allow thousands to die trying to reach the EU and their legal right to claim asylum.” Groups such as City of Sanctuary and the Unity Centre in Glasgow have long offered support to asylum seekers. Media Two newspaper cuttings have highlighted the differences in tabloid attitudes between the UK and Germany. Writing in the Sun, Katie Hopkins likened refugees crossing the Mediterranean to cockroaches. By contrast Bild, Germany’s bestselling title, ran the front-page headline “We are helping” above a picture of two refugee children. Arguably, neither gives an accurate picture of media coverage. The German press may traditionally be more restrained when it comes to anti-immigration rhetoric, but Bild in particular has run articles implying that refugees get an “easy ride”. One said the Hamburg transport authorities waived fines for refugees caught without a ticket on the underground, for fear of provoking bad headlines – something the authorities deny. The true difference may lie in the fact that even right-leaning tabloid newspapers in Germany have balanced critical coverage of migration into Germany with sympathetic reportage on the plight of refugees crossing the Mediterranean. One of Bild’s chief correspondents, Julian Reichelt, has been as vocal in his support of Syrian refugees as he has was previously critical of the Greek government. In Britain, on the other hand, the tone of much tabloid coverage has been remorselessly negative. In May the Daily Mail ran the headline “How many more can Kos take?”, reporting that “thousands of boat people from Syria and Afghanistan” had set up a “migrant camp” on the Greek island – and that British holidaymakers found the situation “disgusting”. Last week the Mail illustrated a story about the rise in net migration to the UK with a photo of refugees crawling through razor wire on the Hungarian-Serbian border and the headline: “How many more can we take?” It said many of the “migrants” would now try to “sneak into Britain”. On Wednesday, meanwhile, Bild lambasted David Cameron over refugees, dubbing Britain “the slacker of Europe”. It said the UK had taken only 114 refugees for every million of population – a third of the EU average. Germany had taken 905 and Hungary a whopping 3,322, it reported. However there appeared to be a shift on Thursday with the Sun’s front page and editorial urging the prime minister to help those in situations “not of their own making” saying: “Mr Cameron, summer is over … Now deal with the biggest crisis facing Europe since WW2.” Football In recent months “Refugees Welcome” banners have appeared at the home grounds of German football teams with a traditionally leftwing fan base, such as Hamburg’s FC St Pauli. Remarkably, they have also popped up at clubs that in the past have had to distance themselves from neo-Nazi supporters, like Borussia Dortmund. Even in Dresden, which has seen high-profile anti-migration marches, the local club Dynamo Dresden has handed out free tickets to 300 refugees. Third-division Berlin club SV Babelsberg 03 has started a third team made up entirely of refugees, called Welcome United, while Schalke 04 have released a video of the team expressing solidarity with refugees, with the hashtag #StandUpIfYouAreHuman. Most of these initiatives have grown organically from local fan groups. There have been no records of similar fan-driven initiatives in the UK game – perhaps ironic, given that the slogan “Refugees Welcome” was first displayed on a Glasgow football ground. In 2007 Celtic’s left-leaning “Green Brigade” supporters unveiled a banner that read “Refugees Welcome – Created by Immigrants”. Attacks on refugees If Germany has accepted disproportionately more asylum seekers than Britain, it has also seen a much higher number of violent incidents directed at asylum seekers. By the end of last week, the German interior ministry had recorded 336 assaults on refugee shelters since the start of the year – over a 100 more than in the whole of 2014. The majority of these attacks had a rightwing motive. In Britain, the Home Office does not publish comparable statistics. The UK charity Refugee Action said it was anecdotally aware of isolated assaults on individuals, and no arson attacks. Unlike in Germany, where refugees have often been sheltered in schools, gyms or hotels, asylum seekers in Britain are usually housed in mixed accommodation, which is less easily identifiable. A large number of attacks in Germany have taken place in the former east: in 2014, 47% of racist assaults were recorded in the five regions that once made up the GDR, even though only 16% of asylum seekers have been allocated to the so-called Neue Länder. Merkel has refused to point the finger at specific regions, saying: “I don’t want to turn this into an east-west conflict.” The legal framework Germany’s proposed quota system will be discussed on 14 September at an emergency summit in Brussels. On Monday Merkel said it “wasn’t right” that some countries were refusing to share the burden. Asked whether David Cameron might do more, she joked: “I won’t get out my instruments of torture.” It was better to “talk to, rather than at” allies, she said diplomatically. Britain and east European countries including Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have fiercely resisted the plan. The Spanish are also not keen. The Home Office has indicated that Britain will not take part in any compulsory EU resettlement scheme or be bound by targets as part of a voluntary scheme. As Merkel noted this week, the UK’s obligations towards Syrian refugees fleeing war are compassionate rather than legal. The UK, Ireland – both outside the Schengen zone – plus Denmark have opt-outs from the EU’s common asylum policy, agreed in the Lisbon treaty. Britain insists that another piece of legislation should be upheld – the so-called Dublin regulation, under which displaced people should claim asylum in the first EU state they arrive in. Germany has unilaterally lifted the Dublin protocol. It says the regulation clearly isn’t working, as tens of thousands of refugees head north through the western Balkans towards Austria and Germany. Britain also believes that the convention is now effectively inoperable. If everyone who entered the EU through Italy or Hungary was sent back to those countries, they would be unable to cope."
2015-10-19T00:02:01Z,"Battle for Aleppo threatens to create fresh refugee exodus, says Turkish PM","The battle for Aleppo, compounded by Russian airstrikes on the city, threatens to create a new refugee exodus from Syria, Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, has warned. Speaking after talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Davutoğlu called for action to prevent a new wave of refugees from moving north across the Turkish border. Aleppo is under assault both from Isis and from forces backing the Syrian government, including Iranian fighters and Russian aircraft. As the influx of refugees into Europe continued, Hungary closed its border with Croatia at the weekend, forcing thousands of migrants to find a new route to through Slovenia and into Austria. On Sunday, Slovenia said it would restrict its intake to 2,500 arrivals a day to ease pressure on both its own and Austria’s borders. The decision caused delays further down the migrant trail, raising fears of human bottlenecks. Davutoğlu said on Sunday: “It is our priority that steps will be taken to prevent an increase of refugees from Aleppo due to the offensive [there] by Iranian militia, Isis and Russian attacks.” “Aleppo is Syria’s second-biggest city. The [Russian] airstrikes in and around Aleppo as well as the Isis attack on the city worry us. They could cause another wave of refugees.” Merkel said Germany was prepared to accelerate accession process for Turkey’s membership of EU in exchange for Turkish help to secure European borders and to make sure that fewer refugees reach Europe. “How can we organise the accession process more dynamically?” Merkel asked at the press conference in Istanbul. “Germany is ready to open chapter 17 this year, and to make preparations for [chapters] 23 and 24. We can talk about the details,” she added, referring to EU accession procedures. Faced with a record influx of refugees this year, Germany is keen for countries on the migration frontline – particularly Turkey and Greece – to deal with the problem there rather than export it north. The onward passage of refugees through the Balkans towards central Europe in recent weeks has placed huge pressure on transit countries. Human rights groups have condemned the European plan for ignoring the rights of refugees. “Talks between the EU and Turkey on ‘migration management’ risk putting the rights of refugees a distant second behind border control measures designed to prevent refugees from reaching the EU,” Andrew Gardner, Turkey researcher for Amnesty International said on Saturday. Davutoğlu said Turkey was prepared to cooperate with Germany and the EU to prevent illegal migration, but underlined that the refugee crisis could not be solved without finding a solution to the war in Syria. Pointing out that Turkey has more than two million Syrian refugees and has spent approximately $7.5bn (£5bn) since the refugee crisis began, he said the international community needed to show more support. The government in Ljubljana said it had refused on Sunday to allow in a train carrying 1,800 migrants from Croatia, after more than 3,000 people surged into the tiny EU member state the day before. German police union chief Rainer Wendt told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper Germany should build a fence along its border with Austria. “If we close our borders this way, Austria will also close its border with Slovenia, and that’s exactly the effect we need,” he said.

2015-12-20T09:00:48Z,Prejudice against migrants speaks 311 different languages,"Did you know that the English language is “starting to die out” in British schools; indeed, that in some of them “English is barely heard at all”? Answer yes if you read a Daily Express front page “special investigation” that reported 311 different tongues apparently spoken in our classrooms. Answer no if you read last week’s Independent Press Standards Organisation verdict on the tale, which found it “inaccurate” and “completely unsupported” by the cited data. Commodious correction with front page presence enforced. Good for Ipso, you may say. At least the Voice of Desmond must fall silent for five minutes or so. But then put this finding in a wider, more dismaying context. “ Moving Stories” – a new report from the Ethical Journalism Network – sets media coverage of refugee crises and migrant flows in exactly that broader landscape and duly seeks many, rather obvious, reforms: expertise, particular care, training, access, increased resources. In sum, standard ethical answers to ethical dilemmas. But, then again, the report’s recommendations can’t be more compelling than the basic situation it outlines – one which changes from country to country, from Turkey to the Gambia to China; lands where migration and attitudes to it vary profoundly. What you think about it depends on where you sit. There is no One Problem: there are countless different problems. And that is our special problem. Which columnist said: “I don’t care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don’t care … these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit ‘Bob Geldof’s Ethiopia circa 1984’, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors”? Which big TV channel warned that “Islamic State is flooding Europe with refugees”? Which prime minister warned that “two million refugees are waiting on the border”? That first, now notorious, quote comes, of course, from Katie Hopkins in the Sun. But the television news headline is Bulgarian, as is the PM with two million on his mind. And Moving Stories has many more grisly examples – from Italy to the inevitable US – of supposed fact stewed in fear, hate and botched perception. What’s to be done (apart from building checklists)? The Italian Carta di Roma, an agreement on responsible coverage of the refugee crisis between many of Italy’s major media players, damns “inaccurate, simplified or distorted information” in clause 1. The editors’ code at Ipso in Britain echoes almost exactly the same formula, with “misleading” instead of “simplified”. There’s no rocket science here. Facts on refugee numbers, refugee plights, refugee solutions are vital. Facts on migrant languages, migrant assimilation, migrant children are vital, too. Of course it’s all difficult: too many national standpoints, too many myths, too much misunderstanding-cum-malice. Of course one person’s fact can be another person’s prejudice. But don’t hide modest satisfaction when the woolliest yarns are disentangled. Make a new passion for fact-checking the theme song of 2016. Leveson: the force doesn’t reawaken After Part One, you’ll remember, there was supposed to be Leveson Part Two. But settle down at the back. Various reasons for a pronounced lack of action can be evinced. Judges (least of all Sir Brian) see no point in presiding over such arid revels. Governments manifest nil enthusiasm for finding the cash. But the basic reasons for total forgetfulness lie in the original briefs. Stage Two was supposed to examine “the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other media organisations or other organisations. It will also consider the extent to which any relevant police force investigated allegations relating to News International, and whether the police received corrupt payments or were otherwise complicit in misconduct.” Well, we sort of know what happened inside News International. See the decision not to pursue criminal corporate proceedings. And we know how the trail ran dry at Trinity Mirror (though not, of course, the mighty legal tsunami of civil claims still washing up on the Mirror’s beach). But the role of the boys in blue – including some in the uppermost regions of Scotland Yard? There the Leveson Crystal Ball One misted over pretty swiftly. Crystal Ball Two, then, would surely have been about the links, the columns, the contracts – the merry-go-round that found Fleet Street and the Yard much too close for comfort. Thank heavens for officialdom’s wisdom in deeming that we’ve heard quite enough of such discomfiting stuff. Case closed."
2015-07-09T11:10:37Z,Greek island refugee crisis: local people and tourists rally round migrants,"On the northern coast of Lesbos, on the shore outside a famous local hotel, the footfall is usually limited to tourists. But on a recent morning, there was an unusual interloper. It was the president of the local village, Thanassis Andreotis, standing on the back of his white pick-up and tuggin the remains of a huge inflatable dinghy up from the beach below. Every morning, refugees use dinghies like this one to get from the Turkish shore – six miles away in the distance – to the Greek islands. And Andreotis saw it as his human duty to pick up the debris. “It’s way, way, way more than last year,” Andreotis, a retired policeman said. “Last year I’d be doing this once a week. Now it’s once a day.” There have long been refugees trying their luck in these waters. But this year, amid the world’s biggest wave of mass-migration since the second world war, the numbers arriving on this isolated shoreline have reached record levels. Arrivals to the Greek archipelago are already 50% higher than for the whole of 2014 – and have even now out-paced Italy. Lesbos, hitherto known as an exquisite tourist destination, has become the frontline – the Greek Lampedusa. It could not have happened at a worse time. The Greek economy is close to collapse, with the European Central Bank threatening on Wednesday to withdraw its support for Greek banks by the end of the week. Not that Andreotis blamed the refugees. “They’re hunted by their government and they’re running everywhere from horrible things,” he said, hauling the last bits of dinghy up from the beach. And he said that lots of local people – some of whom are themselves descendants of migrants who left Turkey in 1922 – agree with him. When he recently went into the centre of town with a megaphone and called for donations for the migrants, “within 10 minutes there were four cars of supplies”. With the central government unable to properly provide for many of its citizens, let alone migrants, this is how the humanitarian vacuum has often been filled. Western reporting has centred on how the wave of migrants, sharing beaches with wealthy holidaymakers, have incensed foreigners and residents alike. There is certainly an awkward juxtaposition: further round this Lesbos beach, tourists sunbathed metres from an Angry Birds arm-band left on the beach by an infant migrant. But there is also another story – one of locals, tourists and expats doing their best in tough circumstances to provide as warm a welcome as possible for a less fortunate kind of expatriate. One of the first welcomes is provided by a British couple, Eric and Philippa Kempson, who live just metres from the closest beaches to Turkey. An eccentric long-haired artist who doesn’t own a mobile, Eric Kempson is an unexpected connoisseur of Aegean smuggling networks. Originally from Windsor, he’s lived here on the north coast of Lesbos for 16 years, earning his living by carving boutique wooden jewellery and sculptures. But over the past few months Kempson has developed a new specialism. He’s learned to spot the migrant dinghies from the moment they leave Turkey at dawn. Early each morning, he and his wife rush up and down the Greek shoreline, handing out water, dry clothes and food to the most vulnerable arrivals. “Usually there are two black boats that come out, mainly Afghans, Pakistanis, mostly men,” Kempson said. “About an hour later, we normally get three grey boats full of Syrians, and those are the ones we usually focus on because they’re full of women and children.” It has been an upsetting experience. “When you see two-week-old children, people with cut feet, and people who haven’t eaten for days – you can’t do anything. I hadn’t cried in 20 years, and I am a hard bastard. But I’ve cried so much in the last four months.” In logistical terms, the Greek government cannot cope either. The EU now wants to establish so-called quarantine zones for migrants on the Greek islands – but the government here already lacks the capacity to house the current wave of arrivals. So in the south of the island, local activists have taken things into their own hands, turning an old scout camp into a makeshift, volunteer-run migrant reception centre called the Village of Altogether. Driving migrants here from the beaches has been a legal grey area, and under a Greek law only lifted on Wednesday you could be accused of the crime of people-smuggling. “But on the other hand,” said a defiant Efi Latsoudis, one of the camp’s founders, “we cannot stay watching hundreds of people with their children – walking, lying in the streets – and let them die there under the sun. It’s impossible. That’s also a crime, to let someone die in the street.” In the north of the island, in the village of Molyvos, others have followed suit. An Australian who’s lived here for four decades, Melinda McRostie, has turned a slip of land behind her well-known quayside restaurant into a makeshift migrant campsite. As soon as Kempson sends her the day’s headcount, her kitchen team at The Captain’s Table get to work preparing food for the island’s newest guests, largely using food and supplies donated by tourists and locals. “It’s obvious that it’s not something that’s going to stop,” said McRostie, of the wave of arrivals that have landed on Lesbos in recent weeks. “So the only obvious thing to do is to do something about it.” McRostie can fit up to 180 people on the land behind her restaurant. This day, there are just 51 Afghanis and a single Pakistani here, sleeping off their exhaustion under the shade of a tarpaulin. Each of them lost all their remaining belongings earlier in the morning, after their boat started sinking a kilometre from Greece. Only quick work by the Hellenic coastguard saved their lives. “Suddenly there was water coming on the boat, and the engine stopped,” remembered Tawfiq Amini, a former mechanic for the US army in Afghanistan, who fled home after the Taliban threatened him for working with foreigners. “Everyone was shouting, the women were screaming. Everyone threw their bags in the water because we thought the boat was too heavy.” Doing her best for people like Amini every day, McRostie has found it emotionally tough. “I’ve stopped remembering names,” she said, carrying two trays of sandwiches from her storeroom to the camp. “I’ve stopped asking stories. It’s just too hard.” But there are some on Lesbos who never wanted to listen in the first place. “Get them away from here,” shouted another local restauranteur, pointing at the makeshift camp that backs on to his property. He was worried it will put off customers. The same day, a vicious rumour circulated via social media that Muslim migrants had defecated in churches, and defiled their icons. It turned out to be a lie, but the takeaway is clear: there are those on the island’s far right who want to stir up resentment of migrants. Golden Dawn, Greece’s far-right party, is certainly quick to seize its chance. “We will do everything we can to protect the Greek homeland against immigrants,” the party says in response to the defecation story. The abuse has sometimes got personal. Kempson said he receives threats because of his activism. During a conversation with the Guardian, an anonymous caller rang his house phone and breathed silently on the other end of the line. “No matter where you are in the world, you’ll get these threats,” he said. “You’ll have people with black hearts who hate human beings.” Andreotis said it was a challenge to keep people united. “There are people who think this will impact tourism,” he says, the dinghy now safely squeezed into his pick-up. “But by and large we’ve managed to make sure that people don’t think there’s anything to be afraid of.” One thing that has worried people is the risk of prosecution should they help a migrant. In order to apply for papers to leave for the mainland, migrants need to get to the island’s capital, Mytilene, 40 miles to the south. Until this week, if they landed on the island without being rescued by coastguards, they couldn’t legally be driven to Mytilene. A law – only overturned on Wednesday – that equated assisting migrants with the act of people-smuggling meant that public buses wouldn’t let them board, and locals were threatened with €100 (£71) fines if they gave anyone a lift. Two were even arrested. Kempson was explicitly warned by the police against driving anyone into town, and was also stopped helping people on the beaches themselves, lest he be accused of smuggling. The result has been that most migrants, in order to embark on the next stage of their journey to mainland Europe, have to walk 40 miles in the heat. In the main bus stop at the edge of Molyvos, a group of Syrian Kurds who fled the advance of Islamic State 10 days ago were bracing themselves for the trek. The ban on giving lifts to migrants had not yet been lifted, and they were weighing up whether to walk – or to plea for local officials to make an exception. “Us men can walk it, but not the women and children,” said a 40-year-old, who called himself Abu Azab. “There’s two pregnant women with us. Did we really risk death at sea for this?” Even in the face of censure, many locals have been doing their best to help under the radar – and even in full view. A few days ago, 41 drivers organised a convoy from Molyvos to Mytilene, each car carrying migrants in full violation of the law. The police did not dare arrest anyone. Tourists have also been at it in their hire cars. Miel Lammens, a Belgian lab technician on holiday in Lesbos for the second time, has driven three groups of migrants southwards, under his own steam. He dropped them a short way from built-up areas, to avoid being detected. “In the beginning I was worried – I thought, should I do this or not?” Lammens said. “But when you pass them and see the women and children, you think, yes, I should. I must do something. It costs me nothing.” Lammens also scoffed at the idea that migrants have ruined anyone’s holidays. “The island has not changed because there are refugees,” he said. “Tourists can still lie on the beach without any problem. I haven’t seen any refugees begging. There’s no problem. If you go to Rome, people are begging for money. But here you don’t have that. I have no idea why you’d cancel your vacation.” There are even some who have devoted their holidays to helping the migrants. One couple flew in specifically to assist the Kempsons in their daily mission. Sabine Fischer, a German nurse, hadn’t heard of the refugee influx before arriving on the island for a holiday but decided to help once she saw the situation. So every morning for a fortnight, she has helped McRostie prepare food and talk to the migrants. “Somehow it just developed,” Fischer said. “They needed someone to help in the morning. I think: I’m here, I don’t have to do any work, I can help.” And McRostie hoped more people follow in Fischer’s wake – not necessarily to help at the camp, but simply to maintain the local economy. “Greece already has one crisis, and now we’re having another one,” said McRostie. “We need tourists to support us.” This article was updated on 9 July 2015 to take in the lifting of a law that equated helping migrants with people smuggling"
2015-10-21T14:19:45Z,Refugee crisis: Syrians arrive at a British base on Cyprus,"Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: A group of 114 Syrian refugee, including 28 children, have arrived on the British airbase in Akrotiri on the southern coast of Cyprus, after being abandoned by people smugglers. Kyriacos Mavri, commander of the Cyprus coast guard, told the Guardian that 114 refugees from Syria were left to fend for themselves in two fishing boats after travelling from Turkey. The smugglers fled in a fast boat. The group have been detained on the base while high-level talks take place between Britain and Cyprus over who takes responsibility for the group. The UNHCR said the group were the responsibility of the UK, while Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Cyprus was responsible. The MoD has released images of the refugees looking well. It said the incident highlights the need “to provide humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries; to disrupt the trafficking gangs and to address the root causes of instability that cause people to seek a new life elsewhere”. A search and rescue operation is underway off the Aegean island of Samos after a boat believed to be carrying refugees sank. Officials with the European border agency, Frontex, and a Greek military naval ship have joined the search north east of the island for 15 people who are still missing. Firefighters have extinguished a fire at a migrant camp in Brezice, on Slovenia’s border with Croatia. The blaze started when people set fire to blankets in protest at being kept. It came a day after 8,000 people crossed the border between Croatia and Slovenia. Slovenia has granted powers to the army to manage its border. The new law allows to troops to warn, direct and temporarily restrict the movement of persons or engage in crowd control. The European Union is calling for another extraordinary summit on the migrant crisis. A statement from EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s office on Wednesday said “there is a need for much greater cooperation, more extensive consultation and immediate operational action.” Nations invited to attend are Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. We’re going to pause the blog for now. The UN’s refugee agency has confirmed that 114 refugees arrived at RAF Akrotiri in two 13 metre wooden boats. “No rescue operation was necessitated as there was no distress signal prior to their docking,” a statement from the UNHCR said. It is awaiting further details: “UNHCR is still waiting to receive detailed information from either the SBA or the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Cyprus. UNHCR has not been able to visit the refugees because access to the military barracks would require authorisation from the SBA which we are yet to receive.” The UNHCR also revealed that “high-level” meetings are underway between British official at the base and Cyprus. It has offered to help mediate. The UNHCR appears to have a different reading from the MoD of an agreement between Cyprus and the UK on who is responsible for the refugees. The UNHCR statement said: Under the terms of the 2003 memorandum of understanding signed between the Republic of Cyprus and the UK, asylum seekers arriving directly onto the SBA are the responsibility of the UK but they would be granted access to services in the Republic at the cost of the SBA. Earlier the MoD said refugees were the responsibility of Cyprus. It said: We have had an agreement in place with the Republic of Cyprus since 2003 to ensure that the Cypriot authorities take responsibility in circumstances like this. A search and rescue operation is underway off the Aegean island of Samos after a boat believed to be carrying 31 refugees sank earlier today, writes Helena Smith. The Greek coastguard, which has dispatched two ships to the scene, says 16 people were rescued when the boat capsized in rough waters near the island. Officials with the European border agency, Frontex, and a Greek military naval ship have also joined the search north east of the island for the 15 others who are still missing. AP has video of that fire at a migrant camp in the Slovenian village of Brezice near the border with Croatia. The camp’s residents were evacuated by police, who say the blaze started when people set fire to blankets in protest at being kept at the camp for more than 24 hours rather than being allowed to continue their journeys to western Europe. The Greek Cypriot media is now reporting that relatives of the refugees have begun gathering outside the gates of the base’s military zone, writes Helena Smith. The well-respected Politis newspaper reckons there are 114 refugees in total including women and children and says there are Syrian and Palestinians amongst them. The gathering appears to suggest that the refugees arrival was part of a well-coordinated plan. “Relatives of the passengers of the two ships have gathered at the gates of the military base on Akrotiri. According to what they have said, they were informed of the arrival of their relatives and [knew] that there final destination was Cyprus.” Those on board had told them they had started their journey from Lebanon on boats “carrying Syrians and Palestinians.” The agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the bases foresees Cypriot authorities examining any asylum request submitted by those entitled to claim it, local officials said. Those who do not claim asylum automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the British bases. “Right now the British bases are doing what they have to do based on their own rules, their own laws,” said Loukas Hadjimichael, deputy head of the department of civil defense adding that British officials were cooperating with the island’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “We haven’t reached agreement yet over whether we will take them, if we will handle them …. or if they will go anywhere else.” “Whatever movement takes places within the Republic of Cyprus will happen in collaboration between the ministry of foreign affairs and the British bases,” he said. The refugees who arrived on Akrotiri, including 28 children, were abandoned by Turkish people smugglers about two miles from the coast, according to the commander of the Cyprus coast guard. Kyriacos Mavri, commander of the Cyprus coast guard, told the Guardian that 114 refugees from Syria were left to fend for themselves in two fishing boats after travelling from Turkey. The smugglers left in a fast boat, the refugees told coast guards who came to the group’s rescue. He said: The people who were trafficking them abandoned them in two fishing boats about one or two miles from the beach just outside the SBA [Sovereign Base Area]. They left in a fast boat. The sea was OK. A fisherman raised the alarm, after seeing Syrian type fishing boats. He said it was probably illegal immigrants. We went to the scene and we informed the SBA. We looked for the smugglers but they had disappeared. Somehow the refugees managed to pilot the boats to shore but I don’t know the detail. We reached them at about 7.15 in the morning. I was on my way to Nicosia at the time, but my sub-commander handled this case. When the refugees were questioned they said they came from Turkey, but I don’t know where. We were told they were all from Syria. There were 67 men, 19 women and 28 children. Many of them had iPhones with them and they were very well dressed. Everybody was OK, they didn’t have any health concerns. They are now under the custody of SBA in the British area. Marvi said the refugees are expected to be transferred to the authorities in Cyprus. “I’ve heard they may be handed to Cyprus, but that’s a decision for the politicians,” he said. Marvi speculated that the smugglers told the refugees that they were being left on mainland Europe. They probably told the refugees this is Greece or Italy and then they left. That’s my guess, that’s what they usually say. The refugees don’t want to come to Cyprus, they want to go to Greece or Italy, because once they get to Cyprus they can’t move freely as it’s an island. So probably they just took the money and sped away. They usually charge them to €3,000 to €4,000 each. More images released by the MoD of the scenes from Akrotiri appear to show the refugees looking well. The Ministry of Defence has released images of some of the refugees arriving on Akrotiri. It said as many as 180 people could have arrived. The refugees on Akrotiri will not be released today, writes Helena Smith. With Cyprus’ Akrotiri base being used as a launching pad for airstrikes against Islamic state militants in Iraq, there are murmurings the refugees could pose a security risk to operations. This is likely to guide the way the refugees are handled over the coming days, well-placed sources on the island told the Guardian. Insiders, who did not want to be named, said accommodation in the base’s military zone could be found to house the refugees if need be. A spokeswoman on the base, Connie Pierce, said it was “very unlikely” that the media would be given access to the refugees today. British military police are likely to want to conduct an in-depth screening of the refugees first. More than 800 French celebrities including Jeanne Moreau Eric Cantona, and the economist Thomas Piketty have urged the French government to tackle insanitary conditions facing migrants at Calais, writes Angelique Chrisafis in Paris. The group, which also included the director of NGO Médicins du Mond, signed an open letter to the newspaper Libération, said the conditions at the makeshift “jungle” camp were dangerously inhumane. As temperatures drop, refugees and migrants seeking to get to the UK, are living in precarious make-shift tents on muddy wasteland with a lack of shelter, scarce access to water and not enough food. Aid workers have warned of serious health concerns including outbreaks of the skin condition scabies. The situation, which aid groups have long described as a humanitarian crisis, has worsened in recent weeks as the number of people sleeping rought there has swelled from 3,000 to 6,000. After the unprecedented appeal by well-known French figures, the French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve will travel to Calais this afternoon for the seventh time in recent months to explain what measures the state is taking to protect the most vulnerable in Calais. He has reiterated that the French state will be “humane” but “firm” on the issue of those in Calais. He said the French figures who signed the appeal were “voicing a concern that I hear and I share.” Cazeneuve is expected to announce in Calais that he will increase the capacity for emergency accommodation for women and children. There is still some confusion about how many refugee boats landed on Akrotiri. Initial reports said two arrived. The Ministry of Defence later confirmed three boats, but later reports said four boats were involved. The MoD has just issued a statement saying “number of boats with migrants on board have landed on the short of RAF Akrotiri.” It added: At the moment our key priority is ensuring everybody on board is safe and well and when we can release further details we will. “We have had an agreement in place with the Republic of Cyprus since 2003 to ensure that the Cypriot authorities take responsibility in circumstances like this. “Events like this underline why it is important for us to develop a comprehensive approach to the migration crisis working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance in Syria and neighbouring countries; to disrupt the trafficking gangs and to address the root causes of instability that cause people to seek a new life elsewhere.” The Croatian news site HRT has broadcast footage of refugees crossing the Sulta river to get from Croatia to Slovenia. It quoted one refugee as saying: “The river is very cold. We need help, clothing, food, we are completely wet.” The group spent the night sleeping rough after the crossing the river, it said. Peter Sutherland, the UN’s special representative for Migration, said the influx of refugee to Slovenia once again highlights the need for countries across Europe to do more to help. The EU’s migration chief Dimitris Avramopoulous is due to hold talks in Slovenia on Thursday to discuss the crisis. A EU programme to relocate up to 160,000 asylum seekers is underway, but so far the numbers involved are small. Firefighters have extinguished that fire at the migrant camp in Brezice, on Slovenia’s border with Croatia, AP reports. The cause of the fire is not known, but and refugees migrants had been lighting fires outside their tents in the camp which is a temporary home to thousands of people. Many of those at the Brezice camp arrived in the dark of night after wading or swimming across the Sutla River in temperatures close to freezing. In the last month more than over 20,000 migrants have entered Slovenia from Croatia, with many thousands more on their way. The nationality of the refugees and migrants who washed up at Akrotiri base is still not confirmed. Earlier police spokesman at the base George Kiteos told local media that they “appear” to have come from Syria. But speaking to Helena Smith he said it still remained unclear whether all the refugees were Syrian. Can the Syrians who arrived at Akrotiri claim asylum in Britain? As the case of the Iraqi Kurds illustrates this is still a matter of legal dispute. But since then Britain and Cyprus have agreed that refugees who land on sovereign UK territory are handed over to Cyprus. Asked whether refugees would be able to claim asylum in Britain, an MoD official said: “that’s not our understanding”. Britain fears setting a precedent that could encourage other asylum seekers to regard the Sovereign Base Areas as a fast track to the UK from the Middle East and north Africa. A spokesman for the British bases on Cyprus confirmed that 110 refugees are being held at the Akrotiri base, writes Helena Smith. “They arrived on the coast in the bit of the base that is closed off. They were brought to shore and are currently in the process of being identified and screened,” George Kiteos, a police spokesman of the British bases told the Guardian. “What happens to them next is up to the politicians to decide.” Connie Pierce a British spokeswoman there, said the refugees were being held in the base’s military zone and that it was very unlikely there would be press access to them today. A Cypriot government official said cooperation on the matter would be dictated by the memorandum of understanding that exists between the Republic of Cyprus and the British-run bases. “We are ready to help if requested … for the moment all the individuals are under the control of the bases. We have no involvement whatsoever,” said Olivia Michalidou, spokeswoman for the island’s civil defence department. This is the first time in the current refugee crisis that refugees have landed on Akrotiri, but the base is still at the centre of a long-running legal battle involving Iraqi Kurds who arrived there in 1998. At the time the administration on the base tried to pass the burden on to the Cypriot authorities but was told the migrants were Britain’s responsibility, as Michael Theodoulou explains. The migrants were moved from Akrotiri to Dhekelia several months later. They were housed in rudimentary, former married quarters for British service families that were due to be demolished, and provided with weekly welfare allowances. It was meant to be a temporary measure. Sixteen years on, 21 of the boat people remain in Richmond Village. With children born there and family members who later joined them, they make up a group of 67. Just over half are children, all of whom are stateless. The Richmond villagers are embroiled in one of Britain’s longest and most bizarre refugee dramas. “Our situation is unbearable,” Layali says. “We feel so cut off from the rest of the world. We’re in limbo.” The “forgotten village” has no shops, no amenities and just a handful of dusty streets. It feels a world apart from Dhekelia’s nearby main military compound, where British forces and their families lead busy lives in a well-ordered setting that resembles a chunk of middle England transplanted into the Mediterranean. The Akrotiri base went into lockdown when the refugees arrived, according to ITV’s Emma Murphy who was on the base at the time to report on British airstrikes against Islamic State militants. She reports: The strangest of ironies is that the lock-down was the result of at least 140 migrants, mainly from Syria, washing ashore in small boats on a beach at the base. Many of those brought to safety were fleeing the tyranny of Isis - they reached safety as Tornados took to the skies on another anti-Isis mission. Welcome to live coverage of the refugee crisis in Europe after 140 Syrian arrive at a British military base on Cyprus and a fire broke out a migrant camp in Slovenia. Here’s a roundup of what we know: A possible new front in the migration crisis has opened up after four boats carrying refugees from Syria arrived at RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus. The refugees, including women and children, have been transferred to a temporary reception area at the sovereign base, which has been used to launch airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. A fire has broken out at a camp for migrants in Slovenia. Some refugee tents have burned. More than 20,000 migrants have entered Slovenia since Saturday when the refugee route toward Western Europe switched toward the Alpine nation. Slovenia has granted powers to the army to manage its border. The new law allows to troops to warn, direct and temporarily restrict the movement of persons or engage in crowd control. The European Union is calling for another extraordinary summit on the migrant crisis. A statement from EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s office on Wednesday said “there is a need for much greater cooperation, more extensive consultation and immediate operational action.” Nations invited to attend are Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia."
2015-11-30T07:21:11Z,Europe split over refugee deal as Germany leads breakaway coalition,"Months of European efforts to come up with common policies on mass immigration unravelled on Sunday when Germany led a “coalition of the willing” of nine EU countries taking in most refugees from the Middle East, splitting the union formally on the issues of mandatory refugee-sharing and funding. An unprecedented full EU summit with Turkey agreed a fragile pact aimed at stemming the flow of migrants to Europe via Turkey. But the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, frustrated by the resistance in Europe to her policies, also convened a separate mini-summit with seven other leaders to push a fast-track deal with the Turks and to press ahead with a new policy of taking in and sharing hundreds of thousands of refugees a year directly from Turkey. The surprise mini-summit suggested that Merkel has given up on trying to persuade her opponents, mostly in eastern Europe, to join a mandatory refugee-sharing scheme across the EU, although she is also expected to use the pro-quotas coalition to pressure the naysayers into joining later. Merkel’s ally on the new policy, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said of the mini-summit: “This is a meeting of those states which are prepared to take in large numbers of refugees from Turkey legally.” But he added later that any such agreement would be voluntary and not binding, while the Dutch rejected German-led calls to resettle large numbers directly from Turkey. The frictions triggered by the split were instantly apparent. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who chaired the full summit with Turkey, contradicted the mainly west European emphasis on seeing Ankara as the best hope of slowing the mass migration to Europe. “Let us not be naive. Turkey is not the only key to solving the migration crisis,” said Tusk. “The most important one is our responsibility and duty to protect our external borders. We cannot outsource this obligation to any third country. I will repeat this again: without control on our external borders, Schengen will become history.” He was referring to the 26-country free-travel zone in Europe, which is also in danger of unravelling under the strains of the migratory pressures and jihadist terrorism. Juncker said he would come up with a system for redistributing an annual “contingent” of refugees from Turkey among the coalition of the willing countries. Reports in Berlin put the figure at 400,000. He was expected to leave that until after the looming French regional elections for fear of boosting the chances of the anti-EU, anti-immigrant Front National of Marine Le Pen. Earlier, Turkey promised to help stem the flow of migrants to Europe in return for cash, visas and renewed talks on joining the EU. The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, called it a “new beginning” for the uneasy neighbours. A key element is €3bn (£2.11bn) in EU aid for the 2.2 million Syrians now in Turkey. The money is intended to raise their living standards and so persuade more of them to stay put rather than attempt perilous crossings to the EU via the Greek islands. The final offer of “an initial” €3bn represents a compromise between the EU, which offered that sum over two years, and Turkey, which wanted it every year. The money will be paid out bit by bit as conditions are met, French president Francois Hollande said, leaving the total payout unclear. “As Turkey is making an effort to take in refugees – who will not come to Europe – it’s reasonable that Turkey receive help from Europe to accommodate those refugees,” Hollande told reporters. He added that the deal should also make it easier to check migrants arriving and keep out those who pose a threat, like Islamic State militants who struck Paris two weeks ago. Also on offer to Ankara, which wants to revive relations with its European neighbours after years of coolness, is a “re-energised” negotiating process on Turkish membership of the EU, even if few expect it to join soon. Many Turks could also benefit from visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen zone within a year if Turkey meets conditions on tightening its borders in the east to Asian migrants and moves other benchmarks on reducing departures to Europe. “Today is a historic day in our accession process to the EU,” Davutoglu told reporters on arrival. “I am grateful to all European leaders for this new beginning.” David Cameron said: “This summit matters because we need a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis in Europe and obviously that involves Turkey. “Britain will continue to play our role, which is about supporting Syrian refugees in the refugee camps and in Turkey. “In terms of the discussions this afternoon, a lot of it will be about the Schengen no borders zone that we’re not a member of. Britain in the European Union will keep our border controls, vital to our security that they are.” After the summit, Cameron held talks with Tusk on Britain’s renegotiation with the EU. Downing Street said: “They agreed that we continue to make good progress. While some areas are more difficult than others, discussions are ongoing with member states to find solutions and agree reforms in all four areas outlined in the PM’s letter to the European Council president. “These discussions will continue in the coming days, including with bilaterals between the PM and other European leaders in Paris tomorrow, and all EU leaders will have a substantive discussion of the UK renegotiation at next month’s European council as planned.”"
2015-04-06T06:21:30Z,Reclaim Australia rallies 'hurtful' to new migrants and refugees,"Refugees and new migrants feel more isolated and vulnerable following last weekend’s Reclaim Australia rallies, community leaders said. The anti-Islam rallies on Saturday attracted hundreds of demonstrators nationwide who were protesting against halal certification, sharia law and increased Muslim migration. Counterprotests were held in several cities, in some cases eclipsing the original rallies. Edward Solo, vice president of the Federation of African Communities Councils in Australia, said the anti-Islam rallies are “hurtful”. “It is really a fearful message,” he said. Solo said many new arrivals will worry that they will be the next targets of the rallies. “It is hurtful to your efforts to rebuild your lives [which were] shattered back home,” he said. Kon Karapanagiotidis from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that the protests build on the anti-refugee sentiment that has been stirred up by the government’s hardline border protection policies. “This is a community that feels like it is under attack, a community that feels isolated and unwelcome,” he said. “Reclaim Australia makes asylum seekers feel more under threat.” Joe Caputo, chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Council of Australia, was wary of giving the protesters too much publicity, labelling them “a totally isolated fringe group that is insignificant”. He said demonstrators were “ignorant”, “misinformed” and “out of this world”, pointing to the fact that no mainstream organisations or politicians attended the rallies as evidence that they are in the minority. But chief executive of the Arab Council, Randa Kattan, warned that even small groups can be dangerous. “In terms of numbers they might be insignificant, but in terms of damage, it is significant,” she said. Kattan said it “only takes one incident” of racism or hatred to spark simmering tensions. The protesters are “squeaky wheels grabbing attention” in order to exploit existing divisions, she said. Solo dismissed protesters’ concerns that Australia would consider adopting sharia law, saying that “lacks serious grounds for action”. “Nothing of that nature can happen now ... or in the immediate future,” he said. Karapanagiotidis has criticised politicians from both sides for not speaking out against the Reclaim Australia rallies, drawing a contrast with German chancellor Angela Merkel who spoke out against ultra rightwing group Pegida by saying members had “hatred in their hearts”. He said the silence of politicians is “damning”, accusing them of exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment. Executive director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation, Hass Dellal, said that there is a “fear of the unknown” within the community, and that the rallies “shouldn’t be dismissed”. He said the best way to overcome that fear is via interfaith initiatives and through open engagement between diverse groups."
2015-11-02T15:49:56Z,There’s no perfect answer to the migrant crisis – and we must face that | Jeffrey Sachs,"There are no easy answers to Europe’s migration crisis. Perhaps that fact alone – the reality that all options are insufficient – could be the basis to build a consensus out of the bitter divisions that now grip the continent. The answer to the crisis in the longer term will depend less on migration policy and much more on smarter ways to avoid such crises in the first place. Those brave politicians who welcome the refugees, like German chancellor Angela Merkel, take a stand of basic human decency. People are fleeing for their lives from terror and war. To deny them asylum would violate the most basic standards of compassion. For you were strangers in a strange land, God reminds the Israelites in setting forth the principles of social justice. Those favouring asylum are also in fact pragmatic. The international law of refugees (including the 1951 refugee convention) bars the forced return of refugees to their homeland. The European court of human rights has long upheld this principle. And with all the walls, and border patrols, Europe is no island. Nor for that matter is the US. Trying to forcibly stop the migrant influx into Europe would fail. Yet those who oppose the refugees have their own valid points. It is true, and not simply cruel, to point out that the flow of refugees reflects the massive and repeated failures of western foreign policies. The US in particular has repeatedly used military force to try to impose its preferred regimes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and beyond. This regime-change policy lies in tatters and more than 10 million displaced people are the consequence. It is also sensible, and not merely cruel, to demand from the politicians a longer term strategy. Accepting a one-time influx of refugees is compassionate. Asserting that Europe’s door is open to migrants and refugees without limit is reckless, not compassionate. No high-income society can throw its doors open to all interested comers: the press of humanity to Europe (or the US) would be essentially unlimited. Gradual migration is important and replenishes our societies; wide-open doors are unfeasible and unmanageable. In the 19th century migrants to the US came with nothing and expected little from the state when they arrived. There were no social transfers; no public healthcare; no guaranteed housing. And only a modest gap between the incomes they were leaving behind and those they would find upon arrival. They came poor but they did not create an underclass, just another addition to the poor they found on arrival. Today, the migrants are leaving societies with incomes a fifth or a tenth of those of their target destinations in Europe and the US. An economist might say open the borders but withhold the social payments that currently attract the numbers, thereby reducing the flow. Yet the refugee sceptics know better. They don’t want to create a new, large and persistent underclass within their own societies. Even without social benefit the numbers would be huge; and the populations on arrival would create new subgroups of penury and social dislocation. The sceptics judge rightly that this is a realistic risk. Nor are the new host countries able to commit large social transfers to an unending, and essentially unlimited, number of new arrivals. Withholding benefits would lead to a new underclass; paying benefits would lead to a fiscal crisis. There is, in short, no good answer. Such an honest reflection could, by itself, help our societies think more clearly about the least bad options. The first implication, in my view, is to accept the humanitarian responsibility of taking in the refugees while simultaneously moving to end the Syrian bloodbath. This can be done if the US and its allies (Saudi Arabia and Turkey) stop trying to overthrow President Assad; and if the US, its allies, and Russia and Iran – with the support of the UN security council – back a joint action against Islamic State. Once peace is restored, most of today’s refugees should return home; and would do so if there were a viable future. In our madness – for what else is it? – the US and its allies spend trillions of dollars on useless wars but then typically balk at funds to rebuild homes, schools, clinics and the rest. The irony is that Europe’s aid budgets are being swallowed in caring for refugees on European soil, when that money should be used to build stable economic futures in the source countries. The second step for Europe and the US is to finance the investments needed for a viable life in the fragile regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia that otherwise will be unremitting sources of mass migration. Europe and the US increasingly reject foreign assistance because, they claim, budgets are tight. Yet how foolish it is to believe that cuts in foreign assistance will be real savings in the long term. If conditions abroad are unviable, the wars, migrations and environmental catastrophes driving today’s crisis will continue to be replicated and expanded. A serious agreement on climate change is also an insurance policy against future mass migration. We know well that the Syrian disaster had some of its roots in the mega-droughts of the last decade. Many more environmental refugees are sure to follow a business-as-usual trajectory of global warming. The climate negotiations in Paris are therefore a key piece of the puzzle. The right wing is cruel to reject the humanity of those whose lives depend on our succour. Yet the pro-refugee politicians will not win the day if they fail to address the deeper causes of the crisis. Accepting the refugees today has to be accompanied by a rapid end to the Syrian war; an end to the US-led wars of regime change; more cooperation in the UN security council; and long-term investments in sustainable development. The flood of refugees will abate to a manageable level only when people everywhere, including in poor and unstable regions, see a safe future for themselves and their children in their home countries."
2015-11-11T13:16:08Z,US millionaire extends migrant rescue mission to Turkey and Greece,"An American millionaire has launched a private rescue mission in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to save the lives of a still-increasing number of refugees and migrants sailing from Turkey to Greece. The Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas), a charity founded and run by Chris Catrambone, an American entrepreneur, already runs a rescue mission off the coast of Libya, and will now operate a second boat in waters between the Turkish coastline and the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos. The ship’s two speedboats will be named after the two Syrian children, Aylan and Galip Kurdi, whose deaths in early September sparked international outrage. Several hundred thousand refugees, mainly Syrian and Afghan, have crossed this stretch of the Aegean Sea this year, and a rising number are now drowning due to the stormier weather conditions. A record 3,460 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far in 2015, roughly 450 of whom drowned in the Aegean, according to figures supplied by the UN refugee agency. Explaining the decision, the charity’s director, Martin Xuereb, said: “As long as people are crossing for one reason or other, there needs to be an asset there that mitigates loss of life at sea. We’re not saying that saving lives will solve the issue of migration, we know it’s much more complex than that. But we’re there to look after the individuals or groups who feel they have no other option to take to boats whether it’s the central Mediterranean [north of Libya], or the Aegean.” Moas’s decision to expand search-and-rescue operations comes on the day that EU leaders meet in Malta for the latest in a series of conferences about how to end migration to Europe. Xuereb said he hoped the existence of Moas, and the high level of donations it has received from the general public in recent months, will show European leaders there is a substantial level of public support for more humane responses to the crisis. “I think what we have done is show that there is a section of people who do not want to be bystanders and do not want people to drown at sea,” said Xuereb, the former commander-in-chief of the Maltese army. “I’m not just talking about Moas, but the thousands of people who have supported us.” Moas will also begin rescue missions off the coast of south-east Asia in the coming months. Doctors Without Borders also operates rescue missions in the southern Mediterranean."
2015-08-10T18:26:00Z,10 truths about Europe’s migrant crisis,"When you’re facing the world’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, it helps to have a sober debate about how to respond. But to do that, you need facts and data – two things that the British migration debate has lacked this summer. Theresa May got the ball rolling in May, when she claimed on Radio 4 that the vast majority of migrants to Europe are Africans travelling for economic reasons. The media has followed suit, one example being the Daily Mail’s unsubstantiated recent assertion that seven in 10 migrants at Calais will reach the UK. Foreign secretary Philip Hammond this week not only repeated May’s claims about African economic migrants, but portrayed them as marauders who would soon hasten the collapse of European civilisation. Hammond, like many people, could do with some actual statistics about the migration crisis. Here are 10 of the key ones: 62% Far from being propelled by economic migrants, this crisis is mostly about refugees. The assumption by the likes of Hammond, May and others is that the majority of those trying to reach Europe are fleeing poverty, which is not considered by the international community as a good enough reason to move to another country. Whereas in fact, by the end of July, 62% of those who had reached Europe by boat this year were from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, according to figures compiled by the UN. These are countries torn apart by war, dictatorial oppression, and religious extremism – and, in Syria’s case, all three. Their citizens almost always have the legal right to refuge in Europe. And if you add to the mix those coming from Darfur, Iraq, Somalia, and some parts of Nigeria – then the total proportion of migrants likely to qualify for asylum rises to well over 70%. 1% If you read the British press, you’d think that Calais was the major battleground of the European migrant crisis, and that Britain was the holy grail of its protagonists. In reality, the migrants at Calais account for as little as 1% of those who have arrived in Europe so far this year. Estimates suggest that between 2,000-5,000 migrants have reached Calais, which is between 1% and 2.5% of the more than 200,000 who have landed in Italy and Greece. Just as importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that as many as seven in 10 have reached Britain after arriving in Calais. The Daily Mail admitted this several paragraphs into its article. 0.027% Hammond said that the migrants would speed the collapse of the European social order. In reality, the number of migrants to have arrived so far this year (200,000) is so minuscule that it constitutes just 0.027% of Europe’s total population of 740 million. The world’s wealthiest continent can easily handle such a comparatively small influx. 1.2 million There are countries with social infrastructure at breaking point because of the refugee crisis – but they aren’t in Europe. The most obvious example is Lebanon, which houses 1.2 million Syrian refugees within a total population of roughly 4.5 million. To put that in context, a country that is more than 100 times smaller than the EU has already taken in more than 50 times as many refugees as the EU will even consider resettling in the future. Lebanon has a refugee crisis. Europe – and, in particular, Britain – does not. £36.95 Many claim that Britain is a coveted destination for migrants because of its generous benefits system. Aside from the reality that most migrants have little prior knowledge of the exact nature of each European country’s asylum system, it is not true that the UK is particularly beneficent. Each asylum seeker in Britain gets a meagre £36.95 to live on (and they are not usually allowed to work to supplement this sum). In France, whose policies are supposedly driving up the numbers at Calais, migrants actually receive substantially more. According to the Asylum Information Database, asylum seekers in France receive up to £56.62 a week. Germany and Sweden – the two most popular migrant destinations – pay out £35.21 and £36.84 a week respectively, only fractionally less than Britain. 50% In the dog-whistle rhetoric of Hammond and Theresa May, the archetypal contemporary migrant in Europe is from Africa. But again, that’s not true. This year, according to UN figures, 50% alone are from two non-African countries: Syria (38%) and Afghanistan (12%). When migrants from Pakistan, Iraq and Iran are added into the equation, it becomes clear that the number of African migrants is significantly less than half. Even so, as discussed above, many of them – especially those from Eritrea, Darfur, and Somalia – have legitimate claims to refugee status. 4% Last autumn, the EU opted to suspend full-scale maritime rescue operations in the Mediterranean in the belief that their presence was encouraging more migrants to risk the sea journey from Libya to Europe. In reality, people kept on coming. In fact, there was a 4% year-on-year increase during the months that the rescue missions were on hiatus. Over 27,800 tried the journey in 2015, or died in the attempt, until operations were reinstated in May, according to figures from the International Organisation for Migration. Only 26,740 tried it in 2014. The disparity suggests that migrants were either unaware of the rescue operations in the first place, or simply unbothered by their suspension – a thesis borne out by my own interviews. “I don’t think that even if they decided to bomb migrant boats it would change peoples’ decision to go,” said Abu Jana, a Syrian I met as he was planning to make the sea voyage earlier this year. 25,870 Contrary to the perception of the UK as the high altar of immigration, it is not a particularly major magnet for refugees. In 2014, just 25,870 people sought asylum in the UK, and only 10,050 were accepted. Germany (97275), France (68500), Sweden (39,905) and Italy (35,180) were all far more affected. When the ratings are calculated as a proportion to population size, the UK slips even further down the table – behind Belgium, Holland and Austria. If the ratings were calculated on 2015 rates, then even impoverished Greece would rise above the UK in the table. Just as tellingly, the UK has welcomed just 187 Syrians through legal mechanisms at the last count. Turkey has around 1.6 million. €11bn Hammond and David Cameron argue that the solution to migration is to increase deportations. They believe this will save Britain money, as less cash will be spent on paying each asylum seeker £36.95 per week. However, this strategy ignores the cost of deportations – whose alleged financial cost could rival that of the asylum seekers’ benefits bill. According to a series of investigations by the website The Migrant Files, as many as €11bn have been spent on repatriating migrants to their countries of origin since 2000. A further billion has been blown on Europe-wide coordination efforts to secure European borders – money that could have been spent on integrating migrants into European society. -76,439 Despite the hysteria, the number of refugees in the UK has actually fallen by 76,439 since 2011. That’s according to Britain’s Refugee Council, which crunched the numbers gleaned from UN data and found that the number of refugees in the UK fell from 193,600 to 117,161 in the past four years. By comparison, the proportion of refugees housed by developing countries in the past 10 years has risen, according to the UN, from 70% to 86%. Britain could be doing far more.

2015-09-03T18:24:18Z,Rethinking and responding to the refugee crisis | Letters,"Europe’s politicians promised to “control the borders”. They spent millions of public funds on fences and border guards, but it hasn’t stopped refugees (The shocking, cruel reality of Europe’s refugee crisis, 3 September). Their number in Europe is still small compared to those refugees supported in the Middle East, but their arrivals and the consequent citizen solidarity have opened the space for political realism. The leaders of Serbia, Macedonia, Germany now accept that trying to blockade their borders is futile. The rest of Europe must face the facts too. Let’s abandon the official fantasy that states can always dictate how and when people cross borders. That approach has failed, and driven thousands of migrants to pay millions to smugglers and corrupt border officials. We need a new approach, rooted in reality. Governments can help refugees move to their place of safety in orderly ways. Border control officials should end their slow, wasteful processes that deliberately keep migrants in uncertain status for years. They should streamline procedures to quickly grant residence permits to refugees and migrants who cannot be removed, enabling them to play a full role in our societies. The UK successfully operated this approach to Kosovar refugees. Labour migration policies should be realistic, fitting the growing demand for young workers. Migrants with no basis to stay should be removed after fair, transparent procedures. Migrants who have not been detained and feel they have been treated fairly are more likely to cooperate with removal: Sweden’s experience shows this. Fortress Europe with its detention and threats of armed force has failed to deter migration. A Europe that treats arrivals humanely, consistently and quickly, with opportunities for labour migration through legal routes from home countries would reduce chaos and expense and allow for real management of migration’s benefits and costs. The alternative is increasing public chaos, migrant deaths and organised crime that harms all of Europe. Simon Cox Migration lawyer, Open Society Justice Initiative • Both your editorial and Yvette Cooper’s calls for a more moral approach to the acceptance of refugees are commendable, but have very little real chance of happening. Europe faces two different migration crises: the lack of ability to control the entrance of huge flows of migrants from outside Europe, and the open border EU policies that means the continent’s nations cannot control the flow of migrants internally. Mostly as a result of the latter, the UK general election saw 4 million voting for Ukip and 4.4 million supporters ensuring they got the most votes in the European election. Furthermore, this public concern about the uncontrolled growth in migrants from European countries into the UK was reinforced by August’s record high net migration figures of a third of a million. Most us are horrified by daily stories of confrontations at the borders, and deaths at sea and in lorries. But with the possible exception of Germany, there is no evidence that most Europeans want to grant asylum to migrants in the numbers seeking it. However, if the rules of the EU were changed to allow countries to take back control of their borders, then the resulting reduction in the migration of Europeans just might allow public sympathy for the plight of asylum seekers to turn into support for them to stay, until it is safe for them to return home. Colin Hines East Twickenham, Middlesex • I am an Austrian national, living in Vienna, and I am experiencing the refugee drama in and around Austria on a daily basis. While Austria, a small country of 8.5 million inhabitants, has taken in thousands of refugees and will continue to do so, I find Britain’s refusal to take in refugees appalling. Perhaps Britain should be reminded that it is at least in part responsible for the chaos that followed the US and Britain’s invasion of Iraq. One can only hope that Britain will have a rethink at the EU conference on the refugee crisis on 14 September. Peter Holly Vienna • In the understandable concern about refugees, one idea being mooted is for each EU country to be allocated a set number to be admitted. But how will that help when those EU countries who signed up to the Schengen agreement have dismantled their borders? Unless Schengen is abandoned, I fail to see how this allocation idea will work in the manner intended. We will still see some countries overwhelmed and others without their fair share. Tim Pollard Purley, Surrey • The Tory/Cameron stand over refugees is becoming a factor in Britain remaining in the EU. The shambles of the EU’s response (except Angela Merkel’s) is making some people consider whether we want to remain in. Then there are the Germans and others who wonder whether we are worth having in when we can be so heartless. Yet the people and their representatives – Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Greens and Welsh – are all calling for the Tory government to climb down and do what Britain has always done for refugees. It shows how appalling our system of government is: built on a minority of votes to carry out a mandate it doesn’t have. Let the churches, mosques and synagogues ask their followers to volunteer to take some refugees into their homes. I think we would find Yvette Cooper’s politically brave 10,000 would have at least a nought added. Peter Downey Bath"
2015-09-03T11:08:35Z,Refugee crisis: what can you do to help?,"The shocking image of a boy who drowned trying to flee the war in Syria has prompted calls for governments to do more to tackle the refugee crisis, but what can individual citizens do to help? So far Germany has put other nations to shame with plans to take 800,000 asylum seekers this year. There has also been a series of impressive voluntary campaigns and gestures, from Refugees Welcome – a scheme for sharing homes with those fleeing conflict and persecution described as ”an Airbnb for refugees” – to a professional football club fielding a third team made up entirely of refugees. By contrast the response of the British media has been characterised by fear rather than compassion, but there are plenty of ways that individuals can offer support. We want to hear about how you’ve helped those seeking asylum. But in the meantime, here’s a guide about some of the ways you can contribute. Give Money A number of charities and non-governmental organisations have opened appeals specifically aimed at helping the plight of refugees. Various organisations spell out exactly what a specific donation could provide. Here’s a sample: Migrant Offshore Aid Station: The charity which runs independent rescue boats to rescue migrants at risk of drowning has seen a huge spike in donations since pictures of the drowned Syrian boy emerged. Médecins Sans Frontières: The humanitarian agency has three rescue ships in the Mediterranean, on Tuesday alone they rescued 1,658 people in its biggest day of operations. Aylan Kurdi Fund: A specific fund named in honour of the drowned boy was set up within 24 hours of the circulation photographs of his body emerging. All proceeds will go to the humanitarian agency Hand in Hand for Syria. Refugee Council: A donation of £100 could pay for the education and travel for two children for a week. Unicef: The UN’s children’s charity is providing life-saving supplies such as clean water, medicine and psychological support. It says a donation of £9 could provide an emergency water kit for a family. Save the Children: It says a donation of £50 could buy two hygiene kits including soap, towels and toothbrushes. British Red Cross: A donation of £30 could buy 28 mats to help Syria refugees cope with the cold. Islamic Relief: Three families could be fed for a month on a donation of £210, the charity says. The crowdfunding website Just Giving has a list of specific appeals for migrants in Calais. It includes one of students trying to raise £750 to buy mobile phones, footballs, camping equipment, dictionaries, storage boxes, sanitary items and waterproof clothing. The UNHCR is running camps, providing shelter and aid to refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, as well as helping refugees across Europe. Other Donations It is not only cash that can help. Refugee Action is offering to take old cars as donations. It says the last scrap car it took raised £126 for refugees. It is also looking for old mobile phones and even printer cartridges. A Facebook group Music Against Borders is looking for musical instruments for migrant musicians in Calais. Teacher Mary Jones is looking for donations of books for her Jungle Books library named after the Calais migrant camp. The grass roots campaign Calais Action is urging supporters to donate in any way they can. It has put together a map of drop-off and collection zones. Volunteer The US refugee charity the International Rescue Committee has opportunities to volunteer at all of its 22 offices. Roles include mentoring refugee families and helping refugees find jobs. The organisation also asking for donations. Protest March on Downing Street in Solidarity with Refugees on Saturday 12 September. The protest begins at noon at London’s Marble Arch. The International Organisation for Migration is urging supporters to get involved in its #MigrantsContribute campaign, which promotes the cultural, economic, and political contributions that migrants make to society. A number of online petitions have been launched, including one calling for a more compassionate Europe-wide response to the crisis and another urging Britain to accept more asylum seekers. What are you doing to help?"
2015-11-27T10:00:04Z,Don't let the Paris climate talks ignore people displaced by global warming | Roberto Lovato,"We are all entering uncharted waters as the effects of climate change begin to create categories of migrants that have no precedent: migrants rendered stateless after their island nations disappear; migrants constituting a vast, roaming “environmental refugee” population; migrants fleeing climate-intensified wars and violence like that in Syria and Central America. In a matter of days, global leaders will enter the most delicate and potentially catastrophic discussions about civilization and migration in history. The UN COP21 conference on climate in Paris could decide the fate of people being displaced by climate change – the number of which has been forecast to be as many as 1 billion people, with 200 million being the most widely cited figure. In September New Zealand rejected Ioane Teitiota’s quest to become the world’s first officially recognized climate-change refugee, and deported him back to the island nation of Kiribati instead. Kiribati is so vulnerable to sea-level rise that its government recently purchased land in Fiji so that it would have a place to relocate its citizens when the islands are eventually submerged, a fate that now seems inevitable. Is this how the west will deal with climate-change refugees? COP21 should be addressing this very question yet, incredibly, the mention of the term migrants may be cut from the final agreement coming out of the critical global gathering. In October a revised draft of the conference agreement showed proposed deletions of any mention of “migrants” from the final conference agreement. Deleting just a over a dozen words will have many unfortunate consequences, including letting the countries of the global North off the hook for continuing with their current strategy. Instead of actually facing the crisis, the global North will just be policing migrants. Before the Paris attacks, the COP21 host country’s president, François Hollande, warned in a press conference in September that, without substantive climate action, “We won’t have hundreds of thousands of refugees in the next 20 or 30 years, but millions.” He also reminded the countries of the global North to fulfill their commitment, made during the 2009 Copenhagen (COP15) talks, to increase aid to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to $100bn a year by 2020. That was before France’s 9-11. Since then, serious talk about serious issues is being replaced by the dangerous and outmoded xenophobic talk that has been making a worldwide comeback in the wake of the Paris attacks. The calls by Marine Le Pen, France’s far-right National Front party leader, to “expel” all the “illegal migrants who have nothing to do here” were echoed throughout the United States, where all Republican presidential candidates sounded immigration alarms. Marco Rubio, for example, called the attacks on Paris part of a larger “clash of civilizations” and also called for the United States to immediately “halt new admissions of refugees from Syria”. This has devastating effects on migrants: painting them as threats, rather than people fleeing threats from civil war, the rising ocean or, as is increasingly the case, violence and conflict that scientists say has been worsened by the effects of climate change. This shift now provides Northern countries another way to mask their unwillingness to deal with the migration crisis that their production and consumption habits have played a role in creating. Yet it is likely that “the burden of providing for climate migrants will be borne by the poorest countries – those least responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases”, according to the International Organization for Migration. The COP21 talks should take a reality-based approach, beginning with actually mentioning the word migrants in the agreement that comes out of the talks, as earlier drafts did. Before the titanic waves of coming displacement, members should also reinstate the idea that Australia (the nation whose outspokenness against dealing with climate migration has it playing the role of Donald Trump on the world migration stage) worked to have stricken from the plan: establishing a “climate change displacement coordination facility” to help with both emergency relief and planned relocations. Also being discussed (at least by the most climate-vulnerable countries) are proposals to include language that opens the door to providing legal protection to climate refugees. These protections aren’t simply a moral imperative; they represent the only civilized approach to climate migration. This piece was published in coordination with Creative Time Reports."
2015-09-11T13:44:17Z,'They need and deserve our help': introducing the Refugees Crossing art project,"“Does Europe have a migrant crisis or are we just trying to ignore a humanitarian crisis?” Over the last few months Bern O’Donoghue has been unhappy about what she sees as an unethical position the UK government has taken on the refugee crisis. “The language used by the government to describe the refugees, and the unwillingness to offer more help to people arriving in Europe asking for basic human rights has left me ashamed.” In order to challenge the use of derogatory language and misinformation about refugees, migrants and immigrants, O’Donoghue has created the art project Refugees Crossing, asking people to put fact filled paper boats in places where people travel and congregate. “We all need to help these people and engage the government to take a more compassionate position. Each paper boat has a fact about refugees on them. I’d like the boats to be seen in towns and cities across the UK, to remind people that refugees need and deserve our help.” While the boats are being shared by people in the UK, recent interest from residents of New York and Budapest confirms the project is gaining momentum. “So far I’ve had at least 45 people sign up. I’ve been asking people to get involved properly since the beginning of last week and I’ve sent out nine packs so far. Those who have signed up have been very enthusiastic and they are also getting friends and work colleagues involved.” Bern encourages people to share their images on social media. “If you share the boats on Twitter, please give the location plus #refugeecrisis and #MigrantLivesMatter. Balanced information about the crisis as part of your upload is also welcomed. The more we share the real information about these people, the sooner they’ll receive the help needed.” Here are just some of the paper boats that have been ordered and placed in public places around the country: “Most people I know and mix with are supportive of immigration and asylum and refugees and know the difference but it is clear from a minority I meet and from below the line comments in news and social media that there is ignorance and prejudice. So anything that helps overcome that is good in my book. Plus it’s a small thing I can do” - Christo, Leytonstone “I got involved because much of the reporting of this issue is appalling, and myths around migration abound. I got so frustrated with some attitudes to migrants and refugees in my own town that I set up Folkestone United to counter negative rhetoric, and to bring together all those who see migration as a positive thing. We have to find as many different ways of getting our message out into the world as we can” - Bridget Chapman, Folkestone “This project has spoken to many of us in Bury St Edmunds Quaker Meeting. Our book of discipline reminds us: ‘That which is morally wrong cannot be politically right.’ We hope that in distributing these little boats round one English town, we will challenge both ourselves and our neighbours” - Jill, Suffolk “It would be hard not to be moved by the plight of the Syrian refugees who are being hit from all sides. However, the response from the public has been heartening and totally at odds with that of our government. This small gesture is just one way of saying that the government does not speak for all of us and is an imaginative way of countering the negative reporting of the mainstream national press” - Tom Batty “I am the great-granddaughter of migrants. I have been a migrant. And I want to live in a country that offers a warm welcome to those forced to leave their homes because of war and persecution. Taking part in this project is a creative way of responding to the humanitarian crisis Europe is currently grappling with, and of saying that migrants and refugees are welcome in my hometown of Manchester” - Rebecca Hurst “The main reason I got involved with this project was to help challenge the extremely negative narrative that has come constantly from the media directed at this crisis. When words such as immigrant, migrant and even refugee begin to be used in a pejorative sense, something is very, very wrong. I think the boats are a powerful image and placing them in places where people are travelling is pertinent. If just one person picks up one of the boats I’ve placed, reads the caption and it makes them think, then I feel like I have done something.” - MrsVB “We need as many British citizens as possible demanding that our government stops denying humans humanity wherever it can get away with it. It’s fundamental that we disrupt the cultivation of hate and fear by media outlets in the UK. Time to create our own counter-dialogue, where we push for a radical redefinition of the word ‘refugee’ and what we expect for each one of them” - Cate Johnston “The photos in the media of the suffering of the people trying to escape danger are heart rending. I am happy to be part of raising awareness by placing these wonderful little boats in as many places as I can” - Kathleen Madigan More information about Refugees Crossing and how to get involved in the project can be found on this Facebook page."
2015-12-02T17:00:00Z,"Detain refugees arriving in Europe for 18 months, says Tusk","Refugees arriving in Europe should be detained for up to 18 months in holding centres across the EU while they are screened for security and terrorism risks, the president of the European council has said. Donald Tusk also put himself strongly at odds with Europe’s most powerful politician, Angela Merkel, by declaring that there was no majority among European governments for a binding quotas system to share refugees between them. The mandatory refugee-sharing regime is the German chancellor’s chief policy for dealing with the migration crisis, not least since about 1 million are expected to enter Germany this year. In a lengthy interview with the Guardian and five other European newspapers, Tusk, the former Polish prime minister, described Merkel’s open-door policy on refugees as “dangerous” and derided data claiming that Syrian-war refugees made up a majority of those trying to get to Europe. Public confidence in governments’ ability to tackle the immigration crisis would only be restored by a stringent new system of controls on the EU’s external borders, he said. Tusk’s remarks contradicted Berlin’s stance and also the asylum policies being drafted across the street from his Brussel’s office in the European commission. In a reference to Merkel’s comment on the migration crisis, Tusk said “some” European leaders “said that this wave of migrants is too big to stop. I’m absolutely sure that we have to say that this wave of migrants is too big not to stop them. But this change of approach must be a common effort. It’s not about one leader. “I think that what we can expect from our leaders today is to change this mindset, this opinion, [which is] for me one of the most dangerous in this time.” In a warning to the rest of Europe, Merkel recently told the Bundestag that the survival of the EU’s free-travel Schengen area hinged on whether national governments could agree on a permanent new regime of sharing refugees. In September she pressed for a majority vote at an EU summit making the sharing of 160,000 refugees obligatory despite strong resistance from eastern Europe. Berlin and the commission are now pushing for a more ambitious permanent scheme directly resettling refugees across the EU from Turkey and the Middle East. Tusk brusquely dismissed this. “There is no majority in Europe to win when it comes to resettlement or the next phase of [refugee] relocation. And not because of the eastern and central parts of Europe only. But many more countries. “In the mid-term and long-term perspective, we can’t use qualified majority voting as something like political coercion … [There are] more countries sceptical towards a permanent and obligatory mechanism. And I can understand why. “All member states will be ready to show more solidarity if they feel that Europe as a whole is ready to protect external borders more effectively. I mean that they are able to reduce this number of refugees, because that is the biggest fear today in Europe. “Debate today is not among politicians or intellectuals or commentators. For the first time in many, many years, I have noticed the debate is really public because the fear and uncertainty is so genuine. You can feel this fear, these feelings on the street. We are talking about our capacities in Europe. No one is ready today to receive these kind of numbers, including Germany.” His remarks highlighted the ever-deepening rift within the EU over how to deal with the refugee crisis. Tusk’s opposition to Berlin also puts Merkel in a tight spot as she appears increasingly isolated both at home and in Europe over migration policy. She may be abandoning hopes of securing sufficient support for a new EU-wide system. But defeat for Merkel would come at a price, with bitterness growing in Germany at the lack of solidarity being shown by the country’s EU partners in the crisis. Similar rancour is evident in Sweden, which proportionately takes in more refugees than anywhere else in the EU. “It’s not only about reducing the flow of migrants,” said Tusk. “Please don’t downplay the role of security. If you want to screen migrants and refugees, you need more time than only one minute to fingerprint. In international law and also in European law we have this rule of 18 months as the time for screening we need. You can and you should retain migrants as long as screening is ready [until screening is completed]. “It’s not only an obligation for frontline countries. We can do it in many parts of Europe. But we need to say very openly that we will do it. Also for security reasons, but not only for this. We have to. This is why fear is so tangible and, in fact, justified. It is the first time in our history that we have to fight this kind of amount and this kind of problem. “This control on our external borders, and procedures inside the frontline countries, but also in some other countries, is something that will reduce this readiness to go to Europe. Today access to Europe is, simply speaking, too easy.” Tusk suggested that it was a myth that the majority of refugees reaching Europe were Syrians in flight from war and said that more than two-thirds were irregular migrants who should be turned back. According to the International Organisation for Migration, nearly two-thirds or 64% of people crossing from Turkey into the EU via the Greek islands by October this year were Syrians – 388,000 of a total of 608,000. A quarter of those making the crossing were children, the IOM said this week. Of 12 deaths in the past week, nine were children and 90 died in October alone. Half of the children arriving in Europe this year were from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, the IOM said. Tusk contested this. “I’m talking about migrants. Sorry, but it is something like a justification that we have refugees [who are] only Syrian and that’s why we have to be as open as today. It’s not true. “Syrians are only the 28-30% of the influx. Seventy per cent of them are [irregular] migrants. This is why we need more effective controls. It’s obvious.”"
2015-10-20T09:27:21Z,More Eurotunnel delays as refugees rush terminal,"Eurotunnel customers faced hours of delays on Tuesday morning after refugees rushed the terminal in Calais in a desperate bid to break through security. Waiting time for passenger services in Folkestone was about two hours while the delay in Calais was about three hours. Eurotunnel said it was unable to sell tickets to passengers without reservations at either end. Eurotunnel has suffered disruption to its services throughout the summer, and now faces new tactics from refugees and migrants, whose numbers have swelled to 6,000 in the makeshift camps outside Calais, known as the Jungle. Eurotunnel said hundreds of refugees had tried to breach the 20-mile perimeter in recent days, in diversionary tactics. These large groups draw police and security personnel away from sensitive access points – roads and tracks near the terminal – that smaller groups then try to breach. The longer nights provide greater opportunity for refugees to operate under the cover of darkness. “These major surges in the early hours overcome security personnel and then they have to spend a couple of hours clearing the tracks and platforms,” said John Keefe, a Eurotunnel spokesman. The mayor of Calais has said troops may be needed to cope with the rising number of migrants trying to reach Britain. Natacha Bouchart said the population of the shanty camps had doubled to about 6,000 in recent weeks, adding that lawlessness in the camps was untenable. At least 15 people have died in or near the tunnel since the start of the cross-Channel migrant crisis at the beginning of the summer. One person died last week after being hit by a freight train at the Channel tunnel’s Coquelles terminal. The surge in migrants attempting to cross the Channel has led to increasing security at the terminal, including extra fencing and the deployment of more border force search and dog teams. “The groups in the camp consist of very intelligent people trying to work out how to overcome obstacles and outwit the police,” said Keefe. “These are the desperate throes of people as they see the exits closing. They will get through the fencing, either through, over or under. They are very resourceful. These 6,000 people have a single goal. We’re not convinced that the problem will ease over the winter as people are arriving in Calais via new routes in eastern Europe.” The Home Office said it had recently spent £7m on security measures at the Coquelles terminal and continued to work with the French authorities to monitor the situation. The EU has agreed a plan – resisted by Hungary and several other eastern European countries – to share out 120,000 refugees among its members, a small proportion of the 700,000 migrants the International Organisation for Migration expects to reach Europe’s borders from the Middle East, Africa and Asia this year. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, says more than 10,000 people are stranded in Serbia, with more on the way but nowhere to go."
2015-10-14T22:44:23Z,Thousands of refugees expected to take to boats for new life as Asia's monsoons end,"Thousands of “irregular” migrants fleeing Bangladesh and Myanmar are expected to board boats for new countries in coming weeks as the end of the Asia’s south-west monsoon season reopening the Bay of Bengal-Andaman Sea route to south-east Asia. In three years, the number of people boarding rickety fishing boats – leaving Myanmar and Bangladesh for countries further south in south-east Asia – has nearly tripled to 63,000 people last year, UN figures show. Each year for the past three years, the post-monsoon spike in the number of people seeking to migrate irregularly by sea across the region has been higher and come earlier in the year. A similar surge was expected this “sailing season”, Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the UNHCR, told Guardian Australia. “The number of people leaving on smugglers’ boats in the Bay of Bengal have increased in recent years, and that trend is likely to continue unless the root causes [of their migration] are addressed,” she said. In the first half of 2015, 31,000 people boarded boats in the region, a 34% increase on 2014’s record figure. Nearly 100,000 people have tried to migrate by sea through the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea since the start of 2014. After a surge of boat departures early this year, the annual monsoon has brought quiet to the route over the past few months. But with the rainy season ending, a new wave of migration is expected. After spending the northern summer rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean sea, the privately owned ship MY Phoenix – operating under the name MOAS, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station – is moving to the Bay of Bengal to assist stricken vessels in south-east Asia. “MOAS will be shedding light on another aspect of this pressing global phenomenon in an area where there is no known NGO rescue presence at sea,” MOAS’s founder, Christopher Catrambone, said. “Once the monsoon rains subside, tens of thousands of Rohingya and others are expected to resume their dangerous sea crossings.” But MOAS’s efforts to rescue people might be complicated by the politics of south-east Asia. Only two countries, Cambodia and the Philippines, are parties to the Refugees Convention, which formalises protections for refugees and allows people to claim asylum. Many countries are expected to refuse to allow MY Phoenix to disembark passengers. Migrant boat journeys across the Bay of Bengal usually start in the weeks immediately after the rains stop and Eid al-Adha – the Muslim festival of sacrifice – is completed. This year Eid al-Adha fell on 22 and 23 September. In recent years, the smugglers who broker the trips have begun using larger metal-hulled boats that are less affected by monsoon weather and able to carry more people. Migrants initially pay between $US50 and $US300 for passage, but many are then extorted by smugglers who demand thousands of dollars more from the passengers or their families, or else the migrants are abandoned at sea, on remote islands, or held in secret jungle camps. Mass graves holding the bodies of hundreds of migrants were uncovered this year in Malaysia and Thailand. At least 1,000 people are missing from journeys in 2015, presumed to have died or drowned at sea, or died at the hands of smugglers on land. In May this year as many as 8,000 people were left stranded on boats at sea because south-east Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia refused to let them land and, in some cases, towed their vessels back to sea. Asylum seekers on board fought each other to death over dwindling food and water supplies, according to observers, and the UN warned the vessels would become “floating coffins” if they were not allowed to land. The Philippines broke the impasse by offering to accept several thousand refugees, and spurring other countries to allow boats to land. Many of the migrants have not yet found durable solutions. Political violence is common in Bangladesh, and the country is experiencing an increasing wave of communal Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks, but most of the Bangladeshi nationals taken from the boats in May were found by the UNHCR not to have a claim to refugee status, but rather were economic migrants, and have been returned to their country. A new migrant labour deal between Malaysia and Bangladesh – which could allow up to 1.5 million low-skilled Bengalis to find work in Malaysia – is hoped to ease the number seeking passage by boat. However, those on boats in May who were Myanmarese Rohingya – an ethnic minority who face intense apartheid-style persecution in Myanmar – remain mostly in camps in the country where they disembarked. “Many Rohingya who left Myanmar cited mixed reasons for leaving, including difficult conditions at home or in camps for people displaced by the 2012 inter-communal violence. They said limited freedom of movement and limited access to services made it hard to work or survive,” Tan said. “The Rohingya who left Bangladesh felt there were no prospects where they were. Some had spent more than 20 years in government-run refugee camps, or in makeshift sites where they were subject to exploitation due to their lack of documentation.” After a temporary solution to the boat deadlock was brokered in May, there has been little progress on a longer-term regional plan for dealing with flows of migrants by boat. The UN’s $13m appeal for funds to respond to the maritime crisis is only 45% funded, and a multinational taskforce, agreed to by countries at a meeting in May, has not yet formed. “A taskforce could help countries to coordinate rescue at sea efforts, pre-identify places of disembarkation, and agree on common standards on reception and solutions for boat arrivals,” Tan said. “These issues need to be discussed and agreed on before the onset of an emergency, not in the middle of a crisis. “This is a regional challenge that calls for regional solutions. With an emphasis on saving lives, UNHCR is asking countries to move beyond ad hoc, disparate responses which could allow smugglers to exploit gaps. Instead, they should work together to address the problem comprehensively in countries of origin, transit and destination.”"
2015-09-20T05:02:15Z,Human migration will be a defining issue of this century. How best to cope? | Alexander Betts,"This is the first time in its history that the European Union has faced a mass influx of refugees from outside the region. Each year, as UNHCR announced record numbers of displaced people, the general assumption – until recently – was that this is a problem for other parts of the world. However, rising displacement that had mainly affected the Middle East and Africa has finally reached Europe’s shores in significant numbers. Many are beginning to ask whether the current crisis represents a temporary peak in displacement or presages a new, long-term trend. On what basis can we know? Will the dystopian images we see at the Hungarian-Serbian border of desperate families being beaten back by armed guards or the shocking image of Alan Kurdi become “the new normal”? The simple answer is: it depends. It depends significantly on us, and the policies we, and our leaders, choose to adopt – nationally, regionally, and globally. Asylum numbers do fluctuate over time depending on the state of the world, and Europe has witnessed significant spikes in numbers before. In 1992, the EU received 672,000 asylum seekers, and numbers remained high during the Bosnia conflict. In 2001, numbers again peaked at 424,000 following the Kosovo crisis and with many arriving from Somalia and Afghanistan. This year, numbers are likely to exceed those figures but not dramatically, especially when one considers that in 1992 there were 15 EU member states and today there are 28. In general terms, the number of refugees in the world is broadly a function of the number of wars and human-rights-abusing dictatorships at any given time. Today, there are a series of internal and regional armed conflicts around the world. Most of these are in two regions, the Middle East and Africa. There are humanitarian emergencies in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Somalia, Nigeria and, closer to home, in Ukraine. The UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, has described a “world at war”. If we were able to address the root causes of those conflicts, the number of refugees in the world would decline significantly. However, there are also grounds to believe that refugees and displacement are likely to become a defining issue of the 21st century. Two global trends in particular suggest this: fragility and mobility. In both cases, the international community is struggling to come up with viable collective responses. First, a growing number of states are characterised by chronic fragility, with weak governance leading to an inability or unwillingness to ensure the most fundamental human rights of citizens. The Fragile States Index places countries such as South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, Syria and Afghanistan towards the top of this list. A significant trigger for this has come from failed state-building projects. Yet the world has had little answer to fragility; in addressing root causes the UN security council has been ineffective. Consequently, many people have been forced to cross borders in search of fundamental rights. Second, there is greater human mobility than ever before. In 1970, there were 70 million international migrants; today there are well over 200 million. With globalisation, the opportunity and inclination to move is greater than ever. States continue to pursue the politically expedient fiction that they can unilaterally assert sovereign control over immigration but the reality is more complex. Related to this, a common popular belief is that if, for example, Syrians exercise agency and choice to move onwards they must be “economic migrants” rather than refugees. The reality is different; there is nothing inconsistent about the idea that someone can be a refugee fleeing persecution and still take the opportunity to seek asylum further afield. Throughout the crisis, a debate has been on whether it is a “migrant” or a “refugee” crisis. It has been important for the public to understand that most people coming to Europe have been from refugee-producing countries and that “refugees” have a particular set of rights under international law. Furthermore, people have a right to seek asylum, and have their claims to refugee status adjudicated. However, the stark dichotomy between “refugee” and “economic migrant” masks a growing trend: that many people coming fall between those two extremes. The modern global refugee regime was established at a particular juncture of history, in the aftermath of the Holocaust and at the start of the cold war. The 1951 convention on the status of refugees defines a refugee as someone fleeing “persecution”, based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group, or political opinion. The interpretation of that definition has adapted over time. But at its core was the idea of protecting people whose own governments were either out to get them or unable to prevent persecution by others. Today, the sources of cross-border displacement are increasingly complex, and many fit poorly with the 1951 convention. Environmental change, food insecurity, and generalised violence, for example, represent emerging sources of human displacement. In strong states, the government can usually provide some kind of remedy or resolution to people affected by these types of crisis. However, much less so in fragile states. People who fall outside the internationally recognised definition of a refugee but are nevertheless fleeing very serious socio-economic rights deprivations might be called “survival migrants”. In the contemporary world, a significant proportion of the people we attempt to describe as economic migrants fall into this category. Survival migration has been an emerging challenge. Nearly a decade ago, Zimbabwean asylum seekers fleeing Robert Mugabe’s regime made up the largest group of asylum seekers in the world. Most British people would probably assume that at the height of the crisis between 2003 and 2009 the majority would have been refugees. However, in South Africa, to where the overwhelming proportion fled, only about 10% were recognised as refugees and up to 300,000 people a year were deported back to Zimbabwe. The reason for this was simple: they were not judged to fit the 1951 convention definition of a refugee. However, on ethical grounds, it was incontrovertibly cruel to deport people back to a country in a state of socio-economic and political collapse. This example illustrates how current policy responses bypass engagement with long-term trends. The world as a whole lacks a vision for how to respond to the changing nature of displacement. So much of the current “crisis” is not a crisis of numbers but a crisis of politics. We need bold leadership that correctly and honestly articulates the causes of movement and outlines global solutions. The 1951 convention offers an important and irreplaceable starting point. At a time when its core norms are being flagrantly violated, from Hungary to Australia, states need to publicly reaffirm its core principles. However, the drafters could not have been expected to anticipate every future scenario. Five major gaps in the refugee regime stand out, which require long-term policy development at national, regional and global levels. ■ Access How are people supposed to claim asylum? In Europe, asylum is based on an inherent contradiction; people are expected to arrive spontaneously in Europe, yet border management means the only means to do so is “illegal” entry. It is this paradox that underlies the smuggling industry, the chaos at Europe’s border, and the loss of life in the Mediterranean. Europe’s current proposals do nothing to address this. One solution would be a humanitarian visa system that allows asylum seekers to travel legally to a country in which they can claim asylum. ■ Responsibility-sharing The current refugee regime creates an obligation on states to provide asylum to refugees on their territory. However, it is vague on the obligations states have to support refugees on the territory of other states. This leads to a fundamental inequity, because responsibility is de facto allocated on the basis of proximity. This becomes a particular problem when a crisis like the Syria situation occurs. Historically, this gap has been addressed through the UN secretary general calling for a global conference, usually run by UNHCR, at which a framework for cooperation is negotiated and commitments made. This is needed for Syria and the Mediterranean. ■ Survival migration Increasingly, people fleeing fall into a neither/nor category. Many people leaving fragile states fall outside the 1951 convention definition but cannot in any way be described as “voluntary” migrants. If they cannot achieve the basic conditions for life and dignity in their country of origin, then, ethically, they are in an analogous situation to refugees. In theory, international human rights law should offer some form of protection to such people but jurisprudence is generally conservative. One solution would be to develop a supplementary “soft law” framework in order to ensure meaningful, temporary protection of such people. If such movements are going to occur, all states are better off addressing them within a predictable, common framework. ■ Markets The dominant approach to refugees is state-centric. It is dominated by a boats-and-camps logic that views refugees either as a border management issue or as a humanitarian concern. It is too often assumed that refugees need be an inevitable burden. Empirical research challenges this; with the right policies, refugees often make a positive economic contribution. Rather than just providing food, clothing and shelter in closed refugee camps, we should be supporting refugee self-reliance through a development assistance fund that can simultaneously benefit refugees and hosts. In a transnational world, there is nothing incompatible about someone being a refugee and also having the opportunity to integrate into labour markets. Doing so offers a route to greater sustainability, and enables refugees to eventually go home and rebuild post-conflict societies. ■ People not in need of international protection A major reason for the crisis of legitimacy of asylum around the world is that states have few practical ways to respond to people without a human rights-based or humanitarian claim. Removal and deportation processes are costly, and challenging both diplomatically and often challenging also from a human rights perspective. In part, we have to accept that the price of asylum is a low level of non-removable people who are not in need of protection. However, there are also creative ways in which alternative channels can be opened. In an era in which many states need workers, collective action by governments, including on skills matching, might enable alternative and democratically legitimate solutions to be created. In the long run, states will be collectively better off working together than acting in isolation. But at national, regional and global levels, leadership is needed to build a vision for a global refugee regime adapted to the needs of a changing world.

2015-12-11T15:02:34Z,Banksy uses Steve Jobs artwork to highlight refugee crisis,"Banksy has revealed a new artwork, sprayed on a wall in the Calais refugee camp called “the Jungle”, intended to address negative attitudes towards the thousands of people living there. The work depicts the late Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, with a black bin bag thrown over one shoulder and an original Apple computer in his hand. The work is a pointed reference to Jobs’s background as the son of a Syrian migrant who went to America after the second world war. In a rare statement accompanying the work, Banksy said: “We’re often led to believe migration is a drain on the country’s resources but Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant. Apple is the world’s most profitable company, it pays over $7bn (£4.6bn) a year in taxes – and it only exists because they allowed in a young man from Homs.” The graffiti is one of a series of works Banksy has created in response to the refugee crisis. During his trip to Calais, the artist covered several walls across the French port with related graffiti, including a riff on Theodore Gericault’s Raft of the Medusa, featuring a luxury yacht. This summer, his temporary “bemusement” park in Weston-Super-Mare featured an installation of boats filled with bodies. On the closing night of Dismaland, Banksy also invited Pussy Riot to debut their song criticising the global failure to help the migrants entering Europe. Since the park closed in September, the artist has been shipping leftover infrastructure from Dismaland to help build emergency housing for the 7,000 migrants, mainly from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, now living on the site of a former rubbish tip in Calais. The “Dismal aid” project has seen site crew from the theme park build accommodation, community buildings and a children’s play area in the camp."
2015-05-05T21:45:39Z,Health screening program for refugee and migrant children under funding threat,"Serious illnesses in vulnerable refugee and migrant children risk going undetected if a New South Wales screening program fails to secure state government funding. The program, Optimising Health and Learning, is a partnership between schools and health services which screens children who have recently arrived to Australia for health issues that may hamper their education. The president of the program, Rob Lindsay, said he helped to establish the pilot program in 2011 when he was deputy principal of Menai high school using seed funding of $25,000 from the National Australia Bank’s school grants program. “It was so successful that in 2013 the project won the NSW premier’s public sector award and the NSW health innovations award,” Lindsay said. “Despite all this, government funding to secure the sustainability of the project has not been forthcoming and our funding will run out in June. “Without the project, between 1,000 and 1,200 refugee and vulnerable migrant children will be exited into mainstream high schools each year with an inhibited capacity to learn, because illnesses affecting their learning will not have been detected.” As part of the program, registered nurses conduct health checks on children attending intensive English language centresin preparation for high school. About 90% of refugee children and 75% of the migrant children screened through the program had at least one condition that needed treatment, Lindsay said. “There’s an urban myth out there that health screening of refugee and migrant children is done before or when they get to Australia, but to get a full, comprehensive health screening you have to be over 18,” Lindsay said. On arrival in Australia students and their families faced language or education barriers to accessing health care, which meant vision and hearing problems, diseases, and iron and vitamin deficiencies went undetected, he said. The NSW health minister, Jillian Skinner, told Guardian Australia the government recognised the importance of programs for newly arrived refugees and asylum seekers, but stopped short of saying the Optimising Heath and Learning program would be funded. “The NSW ministry of health is continuing to work ... to determine how the Optimising Health and Learning Program can complement the refugee health service in relation to child refugees and asylum seekers,” she said. Some health screening services are publicly available, but the engagement rate of refugees and vulnerable migrants was only 18%, compared with 100% of children targeted through the program, Lindsay said. He said after they received treatment, the learning ability and confidence of the students improved drastically. “A couple of years ago I had some teachers come up to me to say one of their 15-year-old students wasn’t learning, but it turned out he had vision problems and couldn’t see what they were teaching,” Lindsay said. “We organised some glasses for him and he came up to me one day and told me he had been able to watch a movie for the first time. “Another child’s teacher said he was out partying all night because he kept falling asleep in class. One day, I saw the child doubled over in pain. It turned out he had an undiagnosed spinal disease that kept him up all night in pain, and he couldn’t sleep.” A cost analysis of the program conducted by the Centre for Health Economics in 2013 found about 7% of students screened had a hearing impairment significant enough to require a specialist, despite only 4% reporting any problems with their hearing. The report found many children were unaware they were unwell. Migrant students were significantly less likely than refugee students to have visited a GP since their arrival to Australia, the report found. Professor David Isaacs, who runs the refugee clinic at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, said about 50% of children he saw in the clinic were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. “That can be stress related to what they witnessed or endured in their homeland, it can relate to a traumatic journey to Australia on a boat, it can relate to uncertainty about what their families face in future,” Isaacs said. “If you don’t deal with health problems related to stress, then it can have a lifelong effect on children and will impair their ability to learn, to relate to others and to contribute to society.” He said the Optimising Heath and Learning program should “absolutely” receive secure state government funding. “If we just assume everyone is all right once they arrive here then we are in for a rude shock,” he said. “We’ll have traumatised people with unaddressed health problems, which is bad for them, and bad for society.”"
2015-12-31T13:01:12Z,Cabinet papers 1990-91: Labor wrestled with rising asylum claims,"“We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.” It was one of John Howard’s more controversial statements, delivered in the 2001 election, two months after the Tampa controversy. But the 1990-91 cabinet documents, released by the National Archives of Australia, show the Labor government was scrambling a decade earlier to tighten immigration and asylum seeker rules to deal with burgeoning numbers. Paradoxically, at the same time, Bob Hawke’s government was struggling to implement his tearful promise to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. When immigration minister Gerry Hand announced the policy to crack down on refugee applications, he foreshadowed Howard’s message, telling parliament the changes would ensure “the first and long-held migration principle, that the Australian government will determine who will be permitted to enter Australia for permanent stay”. The nub of the issue facing Labor in 1990 and governments since that time is contained in Hand’s cabinet paper. “Steeply increasing numbers of applicants in Australia seeking refugee status and residence on refugee or humanitarian grounds, coupled with recent decisions by the courts that eased considerably the test for asylum in Australia, put at risk the government’s control over the profile and size of the migration intake,” Hand wrote. Every cabinet paper asked its minister for an assessment of “sensitivity/criticism” and Hand previewed the criticism which has continued to this day. “Proposed separation of grant of protection from immigration status, changes to migration act and tightening of visa issue will draw adverse reaction from ethnic and humanitarian groups and possibly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Tightening of visa issue may also create some tension in bilateral relations,” he wrote. He reported to cabinet that the number of refugee applicants had grown steadily from 214 in 1980 to 469 in 1985 and 564 in 1988-89. The following year, 1989-90, refugee applicants leapt to 3,077 and in February 1990 alone the number was 577. Hawke’s promise led to an increase in the numbers of Chinese students applying for refugee status, even if they had not been in Australia at the time of his statement. It is not clear from the submission whether Hand’s numbers were the total number of onshore and offshore refugee applicants, but in 2013-14 there were 18,718 onshore applicants in Australia. In the same year in Europe, total claims were 484,600. If Australia allowed entry to more refugees, Hand said, it would send “beacon signals” to source countries. His claim found an echo in 2014 in Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison’s warning that Australia needed to “take the sugar off the table”. “In this situation we face significantly increasing numbers of entrants to the migration stream from the refugee/humanitarian category, placing pressures on our off-shore humanitarian programs, sending ‘beacon’ signals to overseas source areas and potentially disrupting the efficiency of controls over our migration program,” Hand wrote. He lamented the courts were also increasingly taking a “positive stance on asylum” and “community compassion” was trending the same way. “Australia is reaching a point where most on-shore refugee applicants from a country perceived as politically unstable or possessing a limited commitment to human rights (‘at risk countries’) have a strong chance of securing residence (or extension of stay) either as refugees or on humanitarian grounds,” he wrote. As a result, he said, it was taking up to six years to process refugee applicants, which also made it more difficult for overseas applicants who had “waited patiently in line to be assessed” and had far more “urgent and compelling” cases than most applicants in Australia. It was another version of the queue-jumping concept cited from Gough Whitlam onwards. Hand was canvassing a range of options, one of which included taking the matter of refugee approval out of the hands of the courts and giving it to parliament. He noted several senior commonwealth law officers had persuaded him that an answer could be found without taking such a “controversial step”. In June 1990, the cabinet decided that applicants found not to be refugees would be deported. It also broke the nexus between refugee status and residential status – meaning applicants could be assessed as a refugee without automatically receiving residential status. In 1991, just after Keating became prime minister, the cabinet approved a refugee income support payment, which became necessary because the application processing times had increased markedly. Hand won support to reduce the overall migration intake from 140,000 in 1989-90 to 126,000 in 1990-91 and 111,000 in 1991-92, with more focus on a skilled intake. The government also backed financial assistance to draw 6,000 skilled migrants from eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1991, refugee processing centres were established at Villawood and Port Hedland. The following year, the Keating government legislated for mandatory detention as a temporary measure for “a specific class of person”. Cabinet records for 1990 and 1991 held by the National Archives of Australia became eligible for access from 1 January 2016. Information about the cabinet records, lists of the documents and copies of key cabinet documents, including selected submissions and decisions, are available on the archives’ website."
2015-11-10T10:52:00Z,Sweden calls on army to help manage refugee crisis,"Sweden’s army is to help manage the fallout from the country’s refugee crisis, with the civilian administration struggling to cope with an unprecedented surge in arrivals and a top official claiming there is no room left, in the short-term, for migrants reaching Swedish shores. On Monday, military officers were sent to help coordinate logistics at Migrationsverket, Sweden’s refugee and immigration agency. They will be involved at a management level, rather than on the ground. For several weeks, Migrationsverket has already been working with the country’s civil contingencies agency (MSB), a department usually involved in the aftermath of natural disasters or in overseas humanitarian catastrophes. The severely short-staffed migration agency cannot find enough housing for refugees, some of whom have been forced to sleep on the floor of reception centres. Despite some centres quadrupling their manpower in recent months, many agency officials are working double-shifts and weekends. “We don’t have any more space,” the agency’s lead spokesman, Fredrik Bengtsson, said. State-owned accommodation has been full since 2012, he said, and now officials cannot find any more affordable private housing. “For the time being, all of these are finished as well, so for the last three or four nights we’ve had people sleeping in our [non-residential] centres across the country. Right now we’re just looking for people to have a roof over their heads.” Sweden is bearing a disproportional burden of the European refugee crisis, due in part to its pledge in 2013 to provide permanent residency to almost any Syrian who reached Swedish soil. Of the roughly 800,000 people to have arrived in Europe by sea this year, at least one in seven have ended up in Sweden, even though the country accounts for just one in 50 EU citizens. So far in 2015, more than 120,000 people have applied for asylum in Sweden. Migrationsverket expects the total number of refugees to reach about 170,000 by the end of the year, with 10,000 people arriving every week, compared with 4,000 during the summer. A few years ago, case workers hoped to reach a decision on every asylum application within two or three months; now some speculate each one might take two years. For those familiar with other parts of the European migration trail, the scenes in Sweden will seem contained and organised compared with the chaos in places such as the Greek island of Lesbos, where refugees are left to walk and even sometimes sleep in the rain, with little institutional support. But in Sweden, even experienced asylum officials are nevertheless shocked by the unprecedented scale of the challenge that faces them, especially with winter fast approaching. “I’ve never seen this many people, ever,” said Olof Grindemark, a team leader at Märsta, one of the two main reception centres in Stockholm, as he walked past the queues at the centre on Monday. “We don’t seem to have any more beds in Sweden. We don’t have anywhere to send them.” In the medium-term, the situation is not so dire. The government has identified potential space in sports halls and other public buildings for an extra 66,000 arrivals, just under half of which could be converted without too many adjustments. But in the short term, ready-to-use space is proving hard to find due to a combination of allegedly greedy landlords, arsonists and health-and-safety laws. Vandals have set fire to several sites earmarked for refugees, while the agency blames legislative bureaucracy for the delay in opening a series of tent cities in southern Sweden. This struggle to provide something as basic as accommodation has led to fears about Sweden’s ability to handle more complex refugee needs, such as education and healthcare. “How will they manage doctors and schools, and how will [refugees] learn Swedish?” asked Enar Bostedt, one of Sweden’s most experienced asylum lawyers. “That’s totally another issue that no one has had time to think about yet.” For the time being, the migration agency is struggling even to register asylum seekers fast enough. In Solna, the second of Stockholm’s two big reception centres, staff numbers have risen from 30 to 130 in two years, but even this increase is not enough. The volume of applicants is still so great that the management usually has to turn less vulnerable people away, “sometimes by 10am or 11am”, said Joakim Selen, deputy head of the centre’s asylum seeking unit. Staff often work until 11pm, even at weekends, while experienced case workers have been asked to help out with the more basic role of migrant registration, leading to further delays in the decision-making process. In an ideal situation, case workers should judge three asylum applications a week, but this is now rarely possible. “We can’t get out three decisions a week,” said Emma Weinstock, a case worker. “The more cases you have, the more preparation work you have.” Some refugees have lost patience with the backlog. “In Sweden the process is so slow, so I’m going back to Iraq,” said Hassanein, a 29-year-old technician, waiting at Stockholm central station, before his attempted homewards journey. “My family is waiting for me there, and it isn’t safe for them to wait there for so long without me.” Hassanein said he was scared to return, holding up a disfigured hand that he claims was the result of an attack by Islamic State. “But I’m just going back to gather my family, and bring them to Sweden again, so we can all wait here together.” The Swedish government has been criticised for failing to accompany its 2013 promise to Syrians with appropriate measures to prepare for their arrival. In defence of their preparations, Bengtsson said the situation had been very manageable until mid-2015, when the sudden rush of arrivals through Turkey and Greece took all of Europe by surprise. The situation this autumn has been made more critical by a spike in the number of unaccompanied Afghan children, all of whom require an even greater level of care than adult asylum seekers. But whatever the cause of the refugee crisis, it has undeniably caused a crisis of identity within Sweden itself. Some stoke the fear that Sweden risks being unable to provide for its own citizens if it continues to let in so many outsiders. The Swedish Democrats, a far-right party that has recently grown in popularity, distributed a flyer to refugees landing in Lesbos this week that claimed that thanks to immigration “our society is falling apart”, and warned migrants from trying to reach Sweden. Hours later, Sweden’s conservative party, known as the Moderates, called for increased border controls against refugees. Others feel that any dereliction of duties to refugees would mark an abandonment of the core tenets of Sweden’s social democracy. “Our society is built on the principle that people are entitled to the same as everyone else,” said the secretary-general of the Swedish bar association, Anne Ramberg, as she waited to provide legal advice to new refugee arrivals at Stockholm central station. “But we are in a situation where we can’t even give refugees housing.” The answer, Ramberg argued, is not for Sweden to lower its standards, but for the rest of the world’s richest continent to take on its fair share. “A crisis for us,” said Ramberg, “is very different from the crisis in Jordan or Lebanon,” two countries where refugees are estimated to respectively constitute around a tenth and a quarter of the total population. “We could take these people if we had solidarity between EU countries. We are a continent of 500 million people – of course we could do it. But there’s no solidarity. It’s just Germany and Sweden.”"
2015-09-22T14:12:23Z,Refugee crisis: EU ministers to discuss binding quotas - as it happened,"We are going to pause the blog for now, so here’s a summary of the latest key developments: Croatian police blocked off part of the country’s border with Serbia, leaving more than 2,000 refugees straned in no man’s land between the Croatian village of Tovarnik and the Serbian town of Šid. The development marks the first time Croatia has attempted to stop refugees from entering its territory since it became the primary refugee route to northern Europe last week. Europe’s interior ministers are meeting in Brussels for what are expected to be difficult talks on the imposition of refugee quotas. Germany’s Interior minister Thomas de Maizière said: “This will be a hard meeting. I’m not sure that we will have a result ... it is unacceptable if Europe sends a message to the world that today there is no possible solution.” A war of words between central Europe’s leaders worsened after Croatia announced that 35,000 people crossed its border a week after Hungary closed its frontier with Serbia. Hungary said its relations with Croatia were at “freezing point”, as it continued to accept migrants bused back to Hungary’s border by Croatia. Serbia’s prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, demanded EU action against Croatia if it its border restrictions continue. He said: “Croatia cannot be taking it out on Serbia and humiliating it, and destroying Serbia’s economy without consequences.” The German rail operator Deutsche Bahan suspended key services to and from Austria and Hungary until 4 October. German Chancellor Angela Merkel repeated her opposition to building Hungary’s policy of building more fences. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm about the increased use of detention and criminalisation of irregular migrants and asylum seekers. Ban appealed to all European leaders to show leadership and compassion. Once again Britain has said it won’t take part in any EU-wide resettlement programme for refugees. But that didn’t stop Home Secretary Theresa May hectoring her European colleagues on how to treat “illegal economic migrants.” Arriving at the meeting of EU interior ministers, she said: “We need to get on with the job of the wider measures that need to be taken of ensuring that we are breaking the link for economic migrants of making this dangerous journey and settling in Europe. So we need to return those people who are illegal economic migrants and who have no right to be here and we need to ensure that people arriving at Europe’s borders are being properly dealt with, properly fingerprinted, so that decisions can be made, and where there are economic migrants they can be returned.” French police used CS spray on Syrian refugees who refuse to walk to a ghettoised part of Calais known as the Jungle. Many of those affected fall to the ground, with one man appearing to lose consciousness. Freelance journalist Carmen Menendez, who captured the footage on Monday morning, says all of the refugees recovered. Several hundred asylum-seekers camped out near the Turkey’s border with Greece, are refusing to move despite appeals from local officials. Hundreds of migrants made the journey to Edirne in the hope of being allowed to cross into neighbouring Greece. Many arrived last week but have been blocked from approaching the border by the security forces. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeated her opposition to building Hungary’s policy of building more fences. Speaking after meeting her Finnish counterpart she said: “We are learning in this refugee situation that we are all connected to each other and our lives are affected if terrible things happen elsewhere. “We will not be able to change that by building fences ... only by fighting the causes.” The war of words in central Europe continues. The latest volley comes from Croatia’s prime minister Zoran Milanovic who has urged Serbia to “send refugees in other directions too”. Earlier his Serbian counterpart urged Croatia to lift border restrictions by 2pm. Milanovic said that Belgrade should send some of the refugees to Hungary or Romania, AP reports. Hungary said its relations with Croatia were at “freezing point”. Hungary continues to build a new border fence with Croatia. The German rail operator Deutsche Bahan has announced the suspension of key services to and from Austria and Hungary until 4 October. In a statement it said that due to the border controls, “the long-distance routes of Deutsche Bahn will be suspended, initially until 4 October 4, 2015, between Munich-Salzburg (Austria) and Budapest (Hungary)“ Germany’s Interior minister Thomas de Maizière predicted a difficult meeting on the EU resettlement proposals. Arriving at the talks in Brussels, he said: “This will be a hard meeting. I’m not sure that we will have a result. We will work hard and I think it is unacceptable if Europe sends a message to the world that today there is no possible solution. So in the end I’m optimistic, but it is not done yet.” Here’s video, with English subtitles, of a belligerent speech about immigration by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Speaking to Parliament he said: “They are overrunning us. They’re not just banging on the door, they’re breaking the door down on top of us. Our borders are in danger, our way of life built on respect for the law, Hungary and the whole of Europe is in danger. “Europe hasn’t just left its door open but has sent open invitation... Europe is rich but weak, this is the worst combination, Europe needs to be stronger to defend its borders.” Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg’s foreign minister and minister for immigration, sounded upbeat on his way into the talks in Brussels. On Monday he said there were still “a few problems to solve”. But today he said “very hard work” had gone into agreeing a draft text before the meeting. He said the draft text would have a “very positive influence” on all the delegates and should form the basis of an agreement. The EU Migration’s Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said today’s meeting was the time for EU ministers to “show we really mean it when we talk about responsibility and solidarity.” He said the current crisis was “an existential issue” for Europe. Hungary’s foreign minister says relations with Croatia are at “freezing point” over the refugee crisis, AP reports. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said it was easier for Croatia to quickly transport migrants to the border with Hungary instead of caring for them themselves. He said bilateral affairs could improve “if there are elections in Croatia and the new government thinks it wants to improve this relationship.” Szijjarto said while Hungary had done everything possible to register 230,000 migrants this year, it had failed in some cases because of the aggressive behaviour of some migrants and EU rules making it hard to enforce registration. Refugees and migrants are being allowed into Hungary from Croatia as troops in armoured vehicles look on, according to NBC’s Bill Neely. Last week, the Hungarian authorities reported a sharp drop in the number of new arrivals after Hungary sealed its border with Serbia. But since Croatia began bussing arrivals from Serbia to Croatia’s border with Hungary the number of new arrivals in Hungary has shot up again. The OECD predicts that one million people could request asylum in Europe this year. Launching its migration outlook and brefing, the OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said: “European leaders need to step up to the challenge so that Europe as a whole emerges stronger economically, socially and politically. Europe has the experience and the capacity to respond.” “The human cost of this refugee crisis is appalling and countries need to quickly agree a fair allocation of refugees within Europe, and ensure that such vast numbers of troubled people receive shelter, food and support. It’s essential that they also address the medium and long-term policy responses to this crisis. An emerging challenge will be the integration of the many new refugees who will remain in European host countries. We need to scale-up and adapt programmes so that refugees can integrate as quickly as possible in their new homes and make best use of their skills. We should all remember that migration is not a liability, but an asset.” A week since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, almost 35,000 migrants and refugees have entered Croatia, the authorities in Zagreb have announced. They include 2,400 people overnight, Croatia’s interior ministry said. In a statement it said: “Organised migrant transport to the state border is still in effect and there are approximately 1,630 migrants at the Opatovac Temporary Admission Centre. The largest migrant arrival is still expected in the Tovarnik and Ilok area.” “Yesterday approximately 5,100 migrants left Croatia while a further 1,160 migrants departed Croatia befor 9am this morning.” It confirmed that the border crossing at Bajakovo is closed for freight traffic, causing 20km tailbacks. Interior ministers are due to arrive any moment now in Brussels for those crunch talks on binding refugee quotas at the Justice and Home Affairs Council. The European Council has a live feed of the arrivals at the meeting. Hungary’s parliament has passed a resolution calling on Hungary to “defend itself by every necessary means” against “waves to illegal immigration.” It said: “We cannot allow illegal migrants to endanger the jobs and social security of the Hungarian people. We have the right to defend our culture, language, and values.” It blamed current crisis on the EU and urged Brussels to “defend Europe and its citizens.” It added: “We call on the Hungarian government to gather the necessary financial resources and establish such legal requirements in which Hungary may defend itself by every necessary means.” Csaba Molnar, a Hungarian MEP, who opposes the Fidesz government of Vitkor Orban, described the motion as “shameful.” In a letter to European parliament he said: “As Mr Orban and its radical Fidesz see a free-fall in opinion polls, the current Hungarian government is trying everything to distract the attention of Hungarian people from their everyday problems by embracing both the rhetoric and issues championed by the far-right Jobbik party.” The overnight arrival of 2,500 refugees across Croatia’s border with Serbia, caught the Croatian authorities by surprise according to Ralf Gruenert from the UNHCR. Speaking to the BBC at the Opatovac transit camp in Croatia Gruenert was asked to explain why refugees have been involved in scuffles with the Croatian authorities. He said: “The reason is that the refugees are extremely anxious to leave as soon as possible, to northern European countries ... they fear there may be changes in politics and border crossings.” They are waiting for trains or buses to the Hungarian border, he said. The EU plan to resettle 120,000 refugees, which being resisted by many states including Britain and several countries in central Europe, doesn’t go far enough according to the UN’s refugee agency “A relocation programme alone, at this stage in the crisis, will not be enough to stabilise the situation,” UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told Reuters. UNHCR was no longer expecting a mandatory quota of relocation spaces allocated between EU countries, which it had hoped for, but urged EU leaders to back the 120,000 places as an emergency response, on top of 40,000 places for refugees who have arrived in Greece and Italy. The new figure of 120,000 represents only 20 days of the daily average of 6,000 arrivals. Fleming said the UNHCR, which had called for an initial 200,000 places, expected the EU proposal would need to be expanded in the future. Tension is mounting at Serbia’s border with Croatia where migrants and asylum seekers are demanding to be allowed to continue their journey, as Serbia set a deadline for the crossing to be opened. Serbia’s prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, demanded EU action against Croatia if the border is not opened by 2pm. The news agency Tanjug quoted him saying: “We are waiting for the EU to react by 14:00 hours, and then Serbia will react calmly, without violating regulations, but will show that Croatia cannot be taking it out on Serbia and humiliating it, and destroying Serbia’s economy without consequences.” Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic accused Serbia of “sending refugees to Croatia instead of to Hungary in an organised manner,” and added his country was ready to completely shut down the Bajakovo-Batrovci border crossing with Serbia - “if necessary.” Meanwhile, the Croatian media is not reporting any border closures to refugees, according to a Guardian contributor in Croatia. Military vehicles have been seen heading for Hungary’s borders a day after it gave the army the power to use non-lethal force on migrants. Croatia’s prime minister Zoran Milanovic has joined Hungary in accusing Greece of failing to control its borders. Milanovic’s criticism of Greece is one of the only points of agreement between Croatia and Hungary which have been bickering over the crisis since Hungary decided to build a fence between the two countries. On Monday’s Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Greece to stop treating Europeans as “idiots” and start taking “meaningful steps to protect its border and register migrants.” But he also described Croatia’s response as “pathetic”. Milanovic said he was “proud” of Croatia’s response, according to a English translation of a TV interview released by the Croatian government. He insisted Croatia had proved itself as a modern, civilised, humane and well-organised country. Refugees hoping to reach the safety of the European Union face a new obstacle, after Croatian police blocked off Croatia’s border with Serbia, writes the Guardian’s migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley. In recent days Croatia’s frontier with Serbia had become the main entry-point to the EU for thousands of people walking north from Greece. But more than 2,000 refugees were stranded overnight in no-man’s-land between the Croatian village of Tovarnik and the Serbia town of Šid, medics on the scene told the Guardian. A few people are gradually being allowed through the border, but the development nevertheless marks the first time that Croatia has attempted to stop refugees from entering its territory since the country became the primary refugee route to northern Europe last week. After Hungary shut its southern border a week ago, refugees swerved westwards through Croatia, and for several days Croatian police let tens of thousands to enter through this particular crossing point. They were then allowed wait inside the first train station over the border. But with Croatia struggling to process them fast enough, its officials are now keeping people outside the country’s borders until space frees up inside. Ahmed Twaij, a British doctor who has driven flown to the border to help the aid effort, said that the refugees are now stuck between two lines of border-police, with journalists barred from joining them. “At the back-end you have the Serbian police, and at the front end you have the Croatian police,” said Twaij by telephone. “The situation here is dire. We have women and children crying because they’re scared and confused.” Scuffles have broken out between Croatian police and asylum-seekers after they were barred from entering a newly opened reception centre, AP reports. Troubles started at the camp Tuesday, when more migrants came to the gates than authorities could handle. Police in the Croatian village of Opatovac pushed people back from the front gate, asked them to sit down and to wait their turn. Croatia set up a migrant reception operation to try to bring order to the unrelenting chaos that has gripped since last Tuesday when Hungary sealed its border with Serbia. Earlier the Croatia government confirmed that a large crowd of people had gather in Opatovac. Riot police were deployed to the area on Monday. Campaigners have urged European leaders to stop building more barriers and quibbling over quotas and instead come up with a coordinated response that offers refugees proper protection. Amnesty International and the UN’s refugee agency have both said this week’s EU meetings are critical. Amnesty’s Europe director , John Dalhuisen, warned that humanity was being eroded in the chaotic response offered so far. He said: “Failure is not an option. EU leaders must reach agreement on an organized and compassionate response to the arrivals of refugees and asylum seekers to Europe. Some solutions are on the table, what is missing is the political will and leadership to see them through. EU leaders have to show leadership and face the crisis head on; not build more barriers and carry on quibbling over quotas.” “In the absence of an agreed collective response we have witnessed thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers being pushed from pillar to post, without even their basic needs being met. This isn’t migration management; it’s an erosion of humanity.” The UNHCR echoed this message. Peter Sutherland, the UN Secretary General’s special representative for migration, suggested that member states should be threatened with expulsion if they failed to agree to binding quotas. Germany’s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, has been high-fiving refugees on a visit to Jordon’s Zaatari camp. A binding quota system for resettling refugees across Europe could be forced through under a qualified majority vote, according to one of the architects of the plan. Labour MEP Claude Moraes, chair of a committee which pushed the idea of through European parliament last week, said today’s meeting of EU interior ministers “should signal the beginning of the end of paralysis.” Speaking on BBC’s Radio 4’s Today programme he said countries resisting the idea could be forced to accept some refugees or face financial penalties. He said it was “appalling” that EU ministers failed to agree on the idea earlier this month. He added: “The EU is not signalling an organised and compassionate response, so if qualified majority voting has to happen today then it will happen. But I think those countries who are blocking any sort of progress ... they will take some symbolic numbers or they will take some sort of financial penalty. If they don’t do that we are going to have chaotic scenes [and] ... no organised and compassionate response at all.” Moraes said the number of 120,000 refugees being resettled under the plan was already out of date, as thousands more migrants and refugees arrive in Europe. He said: “We have to begin the relocation process because if you don’t get people out of these areas, like the Hungarian Serbian border, out of Croatia, what is happening then is that people just receive panic [and] you have the humanitarian problems of course ... “It can be done, but at the moment with lots of countries blocking even that initial progress we won’t have it. Today should signal the beginning of the end of paralysis. But it has been a painful slow process to get to this.” Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the refugee crisis as EU interior ministers are due to hold talks about binding refugee quotas in the face of resistance to the idea from central European states. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: Central and eastern European leaders have defied attempts by Brussels and Berlin to impose refugee quotas ahead of two days of high-stakes summits in Brussels to try to decide on what already looks like a vain attempt to limit the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe. The Czech government wrote to Brussels arguing that compulsory quotas were illegal and that it could take the issue to the European court of justice , while the anti-immigration Hungarian government brought in new laws authorising the army to use non-lethal force against refugees massing on its borders. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm about the increased use of detention and criminalisation of irregular migrants and asylum seekers. Ban appealed to all European leaders to show leadership and compassion. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban has defended his hardline approach by Europe’s borders are threatened by migration. He said immigrants are “not just banging on the door, they’re breaking the doors down on top of us. Our borders are under threat. Hungary is under threat and so is the whole of Europe.” More than 100 rabbis have urged David Cameron to accelerate and expand proposals for the UK to take in refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria, reminding the prime minister of those who welcomed Jews fleeing the Nazis last century. The group calls on the British government to offer asylum to a minimum of 10,000 “legitimate refugees” in the next six months. Austrian police have said nearly 10,000 refugees and migrants arrived on Monday. Most came through the Nickelsdorf crossing with Hungary where they were moved on to shelters, according to the BBC’s Bethany Bell."
2015-12-04T13:57:45Z,"EU risks being shaken apart by refugee crisis, warns Brussels","There must be a pan-European policy on migration and asylum, or risk the European Union falling apart, according to the EU’s top migration official. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Commission’s senior migration official, told a debate in Brussels on Thursday that the migration crisis is testing the values on which the EU was founded. During an EU committee of the regions debate on 3 December, Avramopoulos, mayor of Athens from 1995-2002, criticised the majority of European countries for failing to do enough to help refugees turning up on the continent’s shores after fleeing war, poverty and persecution. Just eight of the 28 EU member states who originally agreed to a fairer distribution of refugees have taken action to resettle people in their own countries, he said. Regions in the south and east of Europe have been left shouldering most of the burden in the influx of new arrivals. Not only does this test the EU principle of solidarity but also the principle of free movement, according to Avramopoulos. He added that the crisis could threaten the Schengen agreement for a borderless Europe, which he described as the EU’s biggest achievement. During the debate, the committee agreed to back the European commission’s agenda on migration, which calls for stronger border controls and a relocation system to resettle refugees across the EU. The committee, the EU’s assembly of local government representatives, has also called for far greater recognition of the role regional and local authorities can play in tackling the crisis, and direct access to European funding for integration and resettlement schemes. Avramopoulos said anyone resisting the arrival of migrants should remember that Europe is an ageing continent and needs to attract new people, as well as develop strategies to send home those who enter illegally. The confusion in terminology between refugees and economic migrants has caused problems, he said. “We must not listen to nationalists and to xenophobic groups that unfortunately are gaining more and more ground in Europe right now because this misconception exists.” The European parliament’s co-rapporteur on migration, Cécile Kashetu Kyenge, also lambasted the “short-sighted, egotistical policies of certain member states”. Kyenge, a Congolese-Italian politician and member of the European parliament, said the EU should promote a bottom-up approach that involved local authorities in planning and implementing migration policy. “It is up to them, in practice, to find a way to maintain social cohesion in their communities and to prevent social tensions and extremism,” she said. Some members of the committee voiced more hostile views on the crisis facing Europe. Anna Magyar, a Hungarian politician from Csongrád County, which shares a border with Serbia and has seen clashes between local authorities and refugees with police using tear gas and refugees declaring hunger strikes, said many of the migrants entering Europe were simply looking for a better standard of living. “It needs to be made absolutely clear that the boat is full,” she said. “Member states have obligations to their own citizens. When are we going to start protecting our own citizens against the massive flows of illegal migrants?” French politician François Decoster, who comes from Maire de Saint-Omer, about 40km north of Calais, said local authorities are much better placed to determine local need. Speaking to the Guardian, Decoster said the commissioner and French prime minister had visited his region to announce construction of 1,500 shelters. “At the time we had 3,000 people there. The number announced for building shelters was already insufficient,” he said. Decoster called for local authorities to be allowed to bypass their national governments and apply for direct funding from the EU. Each of the 28 EU member states has its own policy; this is one of the reasons why the situation at the border between France and England in Calais is so difficult to resolve, Decoster said. Decoster, who has been working on the Committee of the Regions’ (CoR) response to the European commission’s agenda on migration since the spring, said local and regional governments across Europe are given too little political say, too little funding and too little backing. “That must change,” he said. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of EU member states, praised CoR members for being at the frontline of European politics and dealing directly with the migrant influx. Tusk, the former Polish prime minister, dropped out of the plenary line-up, but in a recorded video message he told delegates that the EU faced existential threats and needed to decide “what kind of political community we are”.

2015-08-26T09:00:11Z,Europe needs a radical new approach to migration. How about making it easier? | Tim Finch,"In theory, the EU has a common asylum policy. In practice, there is almost no cooperation. Faced with this summer’s “migrant crisis”, Hungary is racing to complete a fence to keep Syrians and other refugees out, while Germany has signalled that it will allow any Syrians who get to Germany to remain, in the process tearing up a long-established convention which says that refugees must claim asylum in the first EU country they reach. Closer to home, Britain and France have signed a deal over Calais, but Britain is refusing to even consider any “burden sharing” of refugees with France. And while northern EU states are now working with Mediterranean countries on search-and-rescue at sea, they still won’t help to settle the migrants saved. Meanwhile, unprecedented numbers of migrants – most fleeing conflict and persecution, others escaping poverty and instability – keep coming. Some will find the long-term safety and security they crave. But too many are dying along the way, and for all of them, the journey is arduous, hazardous and expensive. This cannot go on. It is a matter of shame that an EU member state is putting up fences to prevent people from Syria and elsewhere seeking legal protection. And yet as a Hungarian government spokesman said yesterday, faced with 137,000 people crossing its borders irregularly this year, with no passport checks, some action has to be taken. Even Germany’s approach is not as enlightened as it seems. It amounts to saying to refugees: “You’re welcome if you get here, but first you’ll have to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers and risk your life in a leaky boat or on a long journey on foot.” Already traumatised people are faced with yet another ordeal. A new approach is required. At its heart should be an end to the current system of “spontaneous arrival”, which requires refugees to make irregular journeys to Europe in order to claim asylum. Instead, there should be a system of managed protection. All refugees would first have to go and stay in camps in neighbouring countries (as in fact most do anyway), but unlike now, in the confident expectation that if a return home was not possible, they would have a good chance of being resettled in Europe. At the moment, only a tiny fraction of refugees in Europe (fewer than 8,000 annually) come in through managed resettlement. Britain’s Gateway programme, for instance, takes in 750 refugees annually, a number that hasn’t increased since the scheme started more than a decade ago. One reason for this miserable record is that Europe (because of its geographical proximity to the world’s conflict zones) takes in so many asylum seekers through spontaneous arrival – despite the obstacles it erects to prevent this happening. European governments, therefore, feel that they are already fulfilling their international obligations to provide refugee protection. Yet, as we’ve seen this summer, if this is the only route to gain protection, when numbers surge, chaos, misery, and political crisis ensues. As a first step towards a new system, EU countries should, on a one-off basis, provide status (in some cases temporary) to the migrants who’ve already arrived. But thereafter, they should signal that all migrants trying to enter the continent by irregular means (without passports or valid visas) will be stopped and returned. In the case of those with prima facie claims for asylum, not back to their countries of origin, but to UN refugee camps in their region which the EU should fund more generously. The quid pro quo for this stance would be an announcement of a hugely increased EU refugee resettlement scheme, running to several hundred thousand places each year, which would assure refugees that they weren’t going to be left for years in the camps. Such a move would require political courage from European leaders. Most face electorates who do not want to see migrant numbers increase. But I would argue that a shift to a system of managed refugee protection would prove more politically acceptable in the long run than the current disorder. It would mean more recognised refugees coming to Europe, and it would reduce the chaotic irregular immigration which European voters so dislike and which can result in such tragedy. On the other side of the argument, refugee supporters have long rejected the notion of Europe moving to “off shore” asylum processing and turning away anyone who just arrives in an EU country. Yet, if resettlement to Europe was a much more realistic (and quicker) prospect it should not be so objectionable to require refugees to go (or return) to well-run refugee camps in their regions for immediate safety. Just as it is now accepted that economic migration should be managed, the same should be true for refugee protection. Given the fixed positions of EU governments and, indeed, of many refugee agencies, it’s hard to be optimistic about such a scheme being adopted. But in the absence of reform, refugees will continue to vote with their feet and embark on dangerous and disorderly journeys in the hope they’ll get through. This is bad for them and bad for the people of Europe. If the scenes of this summer are not to be repeated, radical change is needed."
2015-09-18T17:44:57Z,Croatia moves refugees to Hungarian border - as it happened,"Amnesty International has released images from earlier this month which it says shows how sealing the border crossing from Serbia to Hungary led to a bottleneck of trapped people seeking entry to the European Union. Amnesty said the images serve as a warning to Croatia, Slovenia and other countries currently considering closing their borders to thousands of people seeking protection. Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International’s crisis response director, who has just returned from the border, said: The shocking scenes from the ground this week at the Horgoš-Röszke border crossing have shown the human toll of Hungary’s irresponsible actions. These images give a deeper sense of the speed and scale of Hungary’s operation to seal its borders, which culminated in a dire situation for refugees and asylum-seekers left in limbo. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte called for a binding agreement to share out migrants between EU countries to stop what he dubbed “asylum shopping”, AFP reports. EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has urged members states to take 160,000 refugees from border countries Greece, Hungary and Italy, grappling with Europe’s worst migration crisis since World War II. Referring to migrants streaming to mainly wealthier western European countries with favourable asylum policies, Rutte said: We have to end the practice of ‘asylum shopping’ Eastern Europe too must shoulder its responsibility. The row between Croatia and Hungary over their respective handling of the migration crisis is deepening as Hungary’s foreign minister on Friday accused Croatia of pushing migrants to break the law by “illegally” breaching Hungarian borders. Peter Szijjarto was speaking in Belgrade after talks with his Serbian counterpart Ivica Dacic and Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic. He said: Rather than respecting the laws in place in the EU, they (Croatia), are encouraging the masses to break the law, because illegally crossing a border is breaking the law. At the moment, the Croatian government is transporting migrants - in contravention of the laws in force in the European Union - towards the Hungarian border instead of giving them a place to stay and looking after their needs. A joint European response to the migrant crisis as countries cannot cope individually, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency said. Babar Baloch, regional spokesman for central Europe for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said his organisation is capable of handling the humanitarian response to the migrant crisis, but “what’s missing is a collective EU action.” Baloch said “within three days we can put in place mechanism for refugee arrivals,” or “empty our warehouses in Dubai, Copenhagen and other places”. He added: “We know how to do the job, but the responsibility, the moral and legal responsibility here is on the countries in the European Union.” Here’s a live feed from the Bermend border crossing between Hungary and Croatia. Buses from the Hungarian side have been taking refugees and migrants who were bussed to the crossing by the Croatian authorities. While some of the 14,000 refugees in Croatia have provocatively been taken to the Hungarian borders, others have been seen arriving in the capital Zagreb. Croatian TV has been showing footage of 1,200 refugees arriving by train in the outskirts of Zagreb and getting on buses from there. They were being taken to the Zagreb Fair site, a Guardian contributor in Croatia report. He added that the Croatian media is reporting that a fight at Beli Manastir station took place between Syrians and Afghans refugees. Croatia has insisted it won’t become a “collection centre” for refugees and migrants in Europe. The Croatia government has put out an English language version of forthright comments made by Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic at today’s press conference. It quotes him saying: “Croatia has shown that it has a heart, both its authorities and its people, but we must remind our neighbours and the EU that we also have a brain and that we know where our interests and our security lie.” It adds: Milanovic said that no one can physically close the borders unless they build wire fences, which Croatia will not do. “Those calling for closing the borders should explain what they mean by it. Closing border crossings does not mean closing the borders,” he said, adding that the daily influx of people into the country was incomparably higher than six months ago.” Croatia has been preparing for this. Croatia is taking them in, but our capacity is small. We can’t do it any more. Over 13,000 people have entered Croatia in two days and a small number of them have left. We can’t control this and we can’t accept them any more because they exceed our capacity,” the PM said. The Croatia authorities have bused thousands of refugees to a heavily defended border crossing to Hungary, according to Jonathan Miller from Channel 4 News. More people have filmed crossing Croatia’s border with Slovenia. Croatia’s deputy prime minister, Vesna Pusic, said Slovenia is carrying out its threat of returning a “certain number of people” to Croatia. But she added that others are getting through. Pusic insisted that Croatia did not have the capacity to register asylum claims, but said it would make an exception for women and children. “There will be various discussions and difficulties,” she predicted. She also revealed that Croatia had had offers to take migrants, from New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States. As Hungary threatens to build more razor wire fences, human rights campaigners have urged its leaders to remember history. Lydia Gall Eastern Europe researcher for Human Rights Watch, says Hungary’s actions are a insult to history. She writes: It’s also tragically hypocritical that Hungary, from where about 200,000 Hungarians were forced to flee in 1956 to obtain protection from Western countries, is currently closing its borders to those fleeing their countries for similar reasons. Hungary should honor its human rights obligations and indeed its own history and keep its borders open to allow people to present their claims for asylum in a fair and transparent procedure. Here’s how the Manchester Guardian covered the first arrival of thousands of Hungarian refugees to Britain in November 1956. It says: “The Ministry of Labour said last night that plans were ready for seeing that the refugees coming to Britain were given suitable jobs as soon as they were rested and settled down. Many offers of jobs, some with accommodation, have come from all parts of Britain, and Ministry of London teams will go to the London hostels where the refugees will be received to help them decide on their future life.” How things change. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: The Croatia government says it cannot cope with thousands of refugees crossing its borders and says it will allow them to pass through to northern Europe without registering asylum claims. Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “We cannot register and accommodate these people any longer. They will get food, water and medical help, and then they can move on.” Hungary started building a new fence on its border with Croatia overnight and has already deployed hundreds of soldiers and police on the border. Announcing construction of the 41km fence, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said: “We must implement the same measures as on the Serbian-Hungarian border.” Slovenia’s government is to hold a meeting of its security council to decide on its response to the crisis. Refugees and migrants were filmed walking through its unguarded borders but it has imposed border restrictions and vowed to send back migrants to Croatia. A man has been electrocuted near the entrance to the Channel tunnel in Calais as he tried to climb on to the roof of a train to reach England. At least 10 refugees or migrants have now died at Calais since the end of June. Almost 500,000 people have entered Europe by crossing the Mediterranean this year, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. It recorded 473,887 arrivals to Europe by sea in 2015. Almost 40% of those making the journey were from Syria. Germany has threatened to use a qualified majority vote to force EU states to accept a binding quota plan to resettle 120,000 refugees across Europe. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: “It just cannot be that Germany, Austria, Sweden and Italy carry the burden alone ... if there is no other way, then we should seriously consider to use the instrument of a qualified majority.” European leaders are to stage an emergency summit next week to wrestle with a refugee emergency that has pitched the union into one of its most bitter political conflicts. Amid ever deepening division and a war of words between eastern and western Europe over how to cope with hundreds of thousands of arrivals, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, called the special summit for next Wednesday after Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, demanded he do so. Croatia’s relations with neighbouring Hungary continue to fray over the crisis. Hungary’s government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, says Croatia’s decision to redirect migrants entering the country toward Hungary and Slovenia is “totally unacceptable.” Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said earlier that Croatia could no longer register migrants in accordance with EU rules, and suggested they would be allowed to pass through Croatia to Slovenia and Hungary. Milanovic also criticised Hungary’s decision to build a new fence on its border with Croatia. “Barbed wire is not the answer,” he said. Speaking to AP Kovacs said: “It is totally unacceptable for a European country to not respect European rules just because it was unprepared.” Practicing what the Pope preaches, the Vatican has housed a family of Syrian refugees. Earlier this month the Pope Francis called on every religious community across Europe to do their part to stem the refugee crisis and offer sanctuary to migrant families. “May every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary of Europe, take in one family,” he said. The Vatican City has announced is had taken in a family that had fled the war in Syria. The family – a father, mother and their two children – came from Damascus and are Melkite Greek Catholics, a Christian church with close ties to the Roman Catholic Church. Refugees and asylum seekers have been filmed strolling through an unguarded border crossing between Croatia and Slovenia. The number of new arrivals in Croatia in the last few days has reached 14,000, according to the country’s interior ministry. A thousand of them are stranded at Tovarnik station, according to Patrick Kingsley. Germany has threatened to use a qualified majority vote to force EU states to accept a binding quota plan to resettle 120,000 refugees across Europe. In an interview with Passauer Neue Presse daily Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: “It just cannot be that Germany, Austria, Sweden and Italy carry the burden alone. That’s not how European solidarity works. And if there is no other way, then we should seriously consider to use the instrument of a qualified majority,” A meeting of EU interior ministers last Monday failed to reach a deal on quotas to distribute 120,000 migrants. An extraordinary summit of the European Union has been scheduled for next Wednesday in Brussels, following a request by Berlin and Vienna. Diplomats have cautioned Germany against using a qualified majority vote. “The consequences of a qualified majority vote (QMV) would be significant,” said Philippe Lamberts, co-leader of the Greens in the European parliament. “Forcing QMV on such a hot issue won’t produce a result. More people are turning their backs on Europe. This should be avoided.” Steinmeier is in Turkey today to discuss the crisis. The Croatia government has confirmed it will no longer register asylum seekers, but will allow them to pass through to northern Europe. It is unclear how this work, as the BBC’s Anna Holligan points out. The queue for buses at Croatia’s Tovarnik station is long and heavily policed, according to this footage from the BBC’s Gavin Lee. Croatia cannot and will not accept the burden of thousands of migrants any longer, Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, told a news conference. He said: “We cannot register and accommodate these people any longer. They will get food, water and medical help, and then they can move on. The European Union must know that Croatia will not become a migrant ‘hotspot’.” He also adopted the same kind of language used by David Cameron in the UK’s response to the crisis. “We have hearts, but we also have heads,” Milanovic said. Earlier this month Cameron said: “Britain will act with our head and our heart, providing refuge for those in need while working on long term solutions to this crisis.” The Greek island of Lesbos has become inundated as refugees battle to reach Athens, according to this video report. Croatia’s Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic has signalled a tough new approach to the crisis vowing that his country will not become a “hot spot”. Within 48 hours of promising free passage through Croatia, Milanovic said: “Croatia’s plan B is to no longer register and accommodate migrants.” He said it was time for Croatia to deal differently with the problem, according to a translation from Reuters. “Croatia cannot and will not accept this burden anymore,” he said. Milanovic also called for a meeting of Croatia’s national security council. Slovenia’s government is to hold a meeting of its security council to decide on its response to the crisis. Authorities expect thousands of people will attempt to cross into Slovenia on Friday after more than 13,000 entered neighboring Croatia in little over two days. Most migrants want to move on toward Western Europe. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Miro Cerar has ruled out creating a north-bound corridor for the migrants. Slovenia has said it will return migrants coming in from Croatia. Dozens attempting to cross have already been held up by Slovenian police. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic is giving a press conference. Croatian speakers can follow it here. Almost 500,000 people have entered Europe by crossing the Mediterranean this year, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration. It recorded 473,887 arrivals to Europe by sea in 2015. Almost 40% of those making the journey were from Syria. On average eight people per day have drowned making the journey this month, the IOM said. Deaths on sea routes today stand 2812, up from 2661 at the end of August. In other words: an average of just over eight fatalities per day through the current month. Croatia has reacted sharply to Hungary’s decision to start work on a razor wire fence between the two countries. In a TV interview Croatia’s interior minister Ranko Ostojic said: “Walls have never prevented anyone, it is absolutely unacceptable. Hungary’s wire won’t stop the wave of people, their crazy ideas are not the solution.” But Ostojic said Croatia would accept people turned back by Slovenia, according to Index.hr. Meanwhile there are more chaotic scenes at Tovarnik railway station where thousands of refugees and migrants are waiting for trains and buses to take them to the Croatian capital Zagreb and beyond. Now that Hungary is building a new fence with Croatia, the only other way to western Europe from Croatia is through Slovenia. The Slovenia authorities are reported to be returning people to Croatia and have stopped all rail traffic between the two countries. Around 150 refugees entered Slovenia by train and were transported to a refugee centre in Postojna in western Slovenia, according to Balkan Insight. Slovenia has already reintroduce border controls with Hungary. Announcing the move the Slovenian prime minister, Miro Cerar, said the controls with Hungary “will make it possible to keep the situation under control”. Overnight, Cerar said refugees will either be registered in Slovenia or sent back to Croatia. Speaking on state television he said Slovenia would implement Schengen rules and that “only those meeting the EU’s requirements can be allowed to cross the border”. More details have emerged about Hungary’s decision to build a new heavily armed 41km razor-wire fence with Croatia. In a radio interview Prime Minister Viktor Orban said: “During the night work already began on building the technical border closure... It seems we can rely on help from no one “Forces are being redeployed, 600 soldiers are already at the scene, 500 will arrive there in the course of the day, and several hundred at the weekend. Two hundred police have been assigned to the Croatian border. “There will be no sandhill or molehill to hide behind, we will defend our borders.” “The western Balkans route is still there. The fact the Hungarian-Serbian border is now closed has not stopped the flow.” Hungary’s decision to fire teargas and water cannon at refugees trying to cross its border on Wednesday continues to be criticised. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said he was appalled by the scenes. In a statement he said: “The images of women and young children being assaulted with tear gas and water cannons at Hungary’s border with Serbia were truly shocking. I am appalled at the callous, and in some cases illegal, actions of the Hungarian authorities in recent days, which include denying entry to, arresting, summarily rejecting and returning refugees, using disproportionate force on migrants and refugees, as well as reportedly assaulting journalists and seizing video documentation. Some of these actions amount to clear violations of international law.” An asylum seeker, thought to be a Syrian man, was electrocuted last night near the entrance to the Channel Tunnel in France, a spokesman for the local authorities in northern France told AFP. He tried to climb on to the roof of a train to make his way to England the official said. “The individual died after he was electrocuted trying to climb on to the freight car,” the official said. The man was found dead shortly before midnight Thursday. Officials said it was the 10th death of a migrant in or near the tunnel since late June. Eurotunnel reported some disruption to services this morning. Croatia’s interior ministry has reported another sharp rise in the number of people crossing its border. The figure for new arrivals this week is now up to 13,300 almost six times the number for the whole of last year. Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said he had a message for migrants: “Don’t come here anymore. Stay in refugee centers in Serbia and Macedonia and Greece. This is not the road to Europe. Buses can’t take you there. It’s a lie.” Patrick Kingsley has the latest from Croatia’s Tovarnik railway station. More than 2,000 refugees were left stranded overnight in a border town near Croatia’s border with Serbia as Slovenia prevented hundreds of others from leaving north-west Croatia, leading to fears that the latest refugee route into the European Union may turn out to be a dead-end. Early on Friday morning, Croatia also closed seven of its eight road border crossings with Serbia after complaining of being overwhelmed by the arrival of more than 11,000 migrants and refugees. At least 2,000 people were stuck in Tovarnik, the first Croatian town after the border with Serbia. While a specially commissioned train arrived to pick many of them up at about midnight, the train was still waiting in the station at 7am, its 10 carriages packed with about 1,000 restless refugees largely from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. More than 1,000 others were left sleeping on the station platforms and in the streets of Tovarnik, a small and sleepy rural town that has no hotels. Small children slept on cold stone slabs, and a baby was placed inside a small suitcase to keep it warm. A right wing mayor in Hungary has launched a chilling video warning refugees and migrants not to try to reach Germany via Hungary. In the video Laszlo Toroczkai, the crew cut mayor of Asotthalom on the Serbian border, is shown in a field next to the border fence flanked by burley border guards dressed in shades and camouflage trousers. “The borders of Hungary are protected by a fence that is continuously being built,” he warns. The video goes on to depict border guards in helicopters, 4x4 vehicles, on motorbikes and on horse back. The action shots are accompanied by the sound macho music. Over the image of a map showing migration routes, Toroczkai says: “If you are an illegal immigrant and you want to get to Germany then the shortest journey from Serbia is through Croatia and Slovenia. Do not trust lying human traffickers. Hungary is a bad choice. Asotthalom is the worst.” There are growing calls for the EU to sanction Hungary over its treatment of refugees. Countries that do not share European values cannot count on receiving money from the bloc, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned in an interview with the newspaper Bild. Gabriel said that while Germany was opening gymnasiums, barracks and homes to refugee families, other countries were “laying barbed wire on their borders and closing the gates”. The comments came after Hungary was widely condemned for using teargas and water cannon to stop people crossings its border with Serbia. Undeterred Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister Viktor Orban announced the start of construction of 41km fence with Croatia. The Washington Post urged Europe to consider suspending Hungary from the EU. In an editorial it said: Tougher steps may be needed to stop Mr. Orban from imposing his agenda of intolerance. Austrian and German officials have suggested that generous EU subsidies to Hungary should be reconsidered; the union also has the option of suspending Budapest’s voting rights. One way or another, the European Union must make clear its rejection of Mr. Orban’s repellent policies. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the increasingly dire refugee crisis as more borders are shut across central Europe. Refugees and migrants continue to arrive at Europe’s door only to be being greeted with more closed border crossings, new fences and extra riot police. Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Hungary started building a new fence on its border with Croatia overnight and has already deployed hundreds of soldiers and police on the border. Announcing construction of the 41km fence, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said: “We must implement the same measures as on the Serbian-Hungarian border.” Croatia has closed seven of eight road border crossings with Serbia after complaining of being overwhelmed by an influx of more than 11,000 migrants. Only the main Bajakovo crossing, on the highway between Belgrade and Zagreb, appeared to be open to traffic on Friday, while neighbouring Slovenia stopped all rail traffic on the main line from Croatia after halting a train carrying migrants on the Slovenian side of the border. European leaders are to stage an emergency summit next week to wrestle with a refugee emergency that has pitched the union into one of its most bitter political conflicts. Amid ever deepening division and a war of words between eastern and western Europe over how to cope with hundreds of thousands of arrivals, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, called the special summit for next Wednesday after Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, demanded he do so. The flashpoints in the crisis are changing on a daily basis, writes the Guardian’s migration correspondent, Patrick Kingsley. On Wednesday, the bottleneck was at Horgoš on Serbia’s border with Hungary, where Hungarian police fired teargas at crowds of refugees who tried to rush a border gate when they suddenly found their northward procession blocked. But by Thursday, after Serbian officials bussed thousands of people from its Hungarian border to its Croatian one, the flashpoint had moved 120 miles south west. At first things seemed to go smoothly. People were dropped off easily enough in Šid. Then they walked through the cauldron of the late Balkans summer, and through a series of pancake-flat corn fields to find waiting trains and coaches, amid an initially warm series of media statements from Croatia’s prime minister. But in Tovarnik, as the news spread that Croatia was open and more than 5,000 people piled over the border, matters quickly unravelled. The government had not prepared enough transport for such a huge volume of people, nor enough water, and there were too few officials to provide information and direction to newcomers who had little idea of where they were."
2015-11-17T13:04:40Z,Students skip classes to show support for refugees,"Students across the country have been walking out of their lectures and classes in solidarity with what they see as the government’s poor treatment of refugees, migrants and international students. The National Union of Students’ international campaign, which organised the “day of solidarity”, has received backing from the University and College Union, the academic workers’ union and the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC). The protesters are using the hashtag #students4migrants on social media. Students at the London School of Economics (LSE) staged a mock border control point to show support for a world without borders. The LSE student union encouraged members to spend the day performing charitable work for refugee organisations. Damien Kemfack, international students officer at LSE’s student union, said: “With the highest percentage of international students in the country, the impact of a large number of participating LSE students should be tangibly felt.” Students at the Royal College of Arts demonstrated outside the Daily Mail’s headquarters in Kensington, west London, to protest against its stance on immigration. Miloslav Vorlíček, co-president of the RCA’s student union, said: “The Daily Mail is noted for a long history of anti-immigration headlines. We hope to shine a spotlight on this paper’s activities. Who knows, we might even convince one or two of its employees to walk away from the dark side!” Students at Goldsmiths, University of London, are showing their support for refugees throughout November. Daniel Nasr, education officer at its student union, said: “[Today’s protest] falls in line with November’s refugee awareness month where there are tens of other events surrounding the struggle of migrants worldwide.” The union will host an exhibition on asylum seeking in the UK, a performance by the Middle Eastern group 47Soul, charity fundraisers and panel discussions that will include students from Syria and other war-hit areas. Students in Essex, Sussex, Reading, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Plymouth, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere are also taking part in the day of protest. Mostafa Rajaai, international students’ officer at the NUS, said: “We want to send a clear message to the government that students in this country overwhelmingly reject the attitude and direction that the UK has adopted regarding immigration. “The failure to respond adequately to the refugee crisis, the mistreatment of international students and the constant attacks on migrants’ rights are all part of the wider anti-migrant sentiment which is on the rise in the UK political establishment.” Alex Norman, international student rep at the NCAFC, said: “The demand for free education is empty if it is not inclusive of migrants. We cannot solve the migrant crisis and anti-immigration rhetoric by making small changes, we can only put it off. We have to have clear demands for the destruction of borders, free movement and full support for migrants.” Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter."
2015-08-12T19:37:28Z,It’s not migrants who are the marauders and plunderers | Seumas Milne,"Never let it be said that Britain’s leaders miss an opportunity to inflame fear and loathing towards migrants and refugees. First David Cameron warned of the threat posed by “a swarm of people” who were “coming across the Mediterranean … wanting to come to Britain”. Then his foreign secretary Philip Hammond upped the ante. The chaos at the Channel tunnel in Calais, he declared, was caused by “marauding” migrants who posed an existential threat. Cheer-led by the conservative press, he warned that Europe would not be able to “protect itself and preserve its standard of living” if it had to “absorb millions of migrants from Africa”. With nightly television coverage of refugees from the world’s worst conflicts risking their lives to break into lorries and trains heading for Britain, this was rhetoric designed to stoke visceral fears of the wretched of the Earth emerging from its depths. Barely a hint of humanity towards those who have died in Calais this summer has escaped ministers’ lips. But in reality the French port is a sideshow, home to a few thousand migrants unable to pay traffickers for more promising routes around Britain’s border controls. Europe’s real refugee crisis is in the Mediterranean. More than 180,000 have reached Italy and Greece by sea alone this year, and more than 2,000 have died making the crossing, mostly from war-ravaged Libya. The impact on Greece, already wracked with crisis, is at tipping point. On the Greek island of Kos, 2,000 mostly Syrian and Afghan refugees were rounded up on Tuesday and locked in a sports stadium after clashes with riot police, who used stun grenades to maintain order. Numbers reaching the Greek islands have quadrupled since last year. But nothing in Europe matches the millions who have been driven to seek refuge in Turkey, Lebanon, Pakistan or Jordan. Set against such a global drama, Calais is little more than deathly theatre. Britain is not one of the main destinations for either refugees or illegal migrants – the vast majority of whom overstay their visas, rather than stow away in the Channel tunnel. Last year 25,870 sought asylum in the UK and only 10,050 were accepted. By contrast, Sweden accepted three times as many and Germany had more than 200,000 asylum and new asylum applicants. Nor is Britain’s asylum seeker’s benefit rate, at £36.95 a week, remotely the magnet it is portrayed. France pays £41.42; in Norway it’s £88.65. What does suck overwhelmingly legal migrant workers into Britain is a highly deregulated labour market, where workplace protection is often not enforced and which both gangmasters and large private companies are able ruthlessly to exploit. The case, reported in the Guardian, of the entirely legal Lithuanian farm workers – who are suing a Kent-based gangmaster supplying high street supermarkets over inhuman working conditions, debt bondage and violent intimidation – is only the extreme end of a growing underbelly of harsh and insecure employment. If ministers were remotely concerned about “rogue employers driving down wages” by using illegal migrants, as they claim, they would be strengthening trade unions and rights at work. But they’re doing the opposite. And they’re using the language of dehumanisation to justify slashing support for asylum seekers’ children, locking up refused applicants indefinitely and targeting illegal workers far more enthusiastically than the employers who exploit them. But what risks dividing communities can also turn them against such anti-migrant crackdowns. In recent months, flash protests have erupted in London and other cities against UK Border Agency attempts to arrest failed asylum seekers or undocumented migrant workers. In areas such as Elephant and Castle, riot police have been called in after UKBA vans were surrounded and pelted with eggs by angry locals and activists trying to prevent the detention of people seen as part of the community. The chaos at Calais and the far larger-scale upheaval and suffering across Europe could be brought under control by the kind of managed processing that northern European governments, such as Britain’s, are so keen to avoid. But that would only be a temporary fix for a refugee crisis driven by war and state disintegration – and Britain, France and their allies have played a central role in most of the wars that are fuelling it. The refugees arriving in Europe come from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Pakistan, Somalia and Eritrea. With the recent exception of the dictatorial Eritrean regime, those are a roll-call of more than a decade of disastrous western-led wars and interventions. In the case of Libya, the British and French-led bombing campaign in 2011 led directly to the civil war and social breakdown that has made the country the main conduit for refugee trafficking from Africa. And in Syria, the western funding, arming and training of opposition groups – while fuelling the rise of Isis – has played a crucial role in the country’s destruction. If the current American and British-backed Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen continues, expect Yemeni refugees to join the region’s exodus in the months to come. So the first longer term contribution Britain and its allies could make to staunching the flow of refugees would be to stop waging open and covert wars in the Middle East and north Africa. That is actual marauding. The second would be a major shift in policy towards African development. Africa may not be leading the current refugee crisis, and African migrants certainly don’t threaten European living standards. But as a group of global poverty NGOs argued this week, Africa is being drained of resources through western corporate profit extraction, extortionate debt repayments and one-sided trade “partnership” deals. If that plunder continues and absolute numbers in poverty go on rising as climate change bites deeper, migration pressures to the wealthy north can only grow. There is a genuine migration crisis driven by war and neoliberal globalisation. Despite the scaremongering, it hasn’t yet reached Britain. But it’s a fantasy to imagine that fences, deportations and better security can protect fortress Europe. An end to the real plunder and marauding would be more effective."
2015-09-04T16:41:46Z,This refugee crisis is too big for Europe to handle - its institutions are broken,"When you cut through the horror and the hypocrisy, the exodus across the Balkans is not just a refugee crisis. This is the first, mass trans-regional flight of modern times. The Middle East has exploded across our TV screens for decades, but now it suddenly feels like an adjacent conflict zone. Just as we realised, in the 1990s, that the Bosnian killing fields were just a commuter flight away, today we are confronted by a clear land and ferry route from the war zone on the Euphrates to refugee centres on the Danube and the Rhine. The resulting crisis may prove too big for Europe to handle. Yes, there have been feelgood moments for anti-racists: as when thousands of German football fans raised banners welcoming the refugees. And Angela Merkel’s decision to process all Syrian asylum applications swept aside complacency. But as it unfolds, this crisis will place a severe strain on the EU’s institutions, and even concepts, for handling migration. The Dublin III regulation, which requires all asylum seekers to be fingerprinted and sent back to their first country of arrival in the EU, is effectively suspended. The Schengen agreement, which allows passport-free movement across central and western Europe, is falling apart: countries surrounding both Hungary and Italy have attempted to place ad hoc controls on migrants and refugees. Frontex, the agency that for years coordinated a policy of deterrence and prevention – through sea patrols and border fences – looks powerless. And even as the news organisations agonise over the terminology – migrant or refugee – the distinctions on the ground are becoming pointless. Some migrants trapped in Greece for months or years, not from Syria and already denied asylum, have joined the trudge through the Balkans: they would rather take their chances in the German asylum system than in the Greek one, especially if the right returns to power in Athens this month. If you go to Victoria Square in Athens, where migrants cluster to seek out traffickers, you will meet people from other conflicts, people we’ve not been so hospitable to: Kurds, Afghans, oppressed minorities from Central Asia or Iran, people from Darfur and Eritrea. They are, by definition, asylum seekers – but the EU’s asylum system has already rejected most of them. When I interviewed migrants in Morocco in 2013 preparing to make the sea crossing to Spain they were clustered into makeshift homes together, regardless of status: the political dissident from Gambia, the bricklayers from drought-hit Niger, the women fleeing poverty in west Africa who now faced racism and sexual violence in Morocco itself. The disorder we have allowed to assemble at the borders of Europe does not easily divide into “economics” and “war”. The conceit that we can segment those coming here into the “deserving and undeserving” is going to shatter as their claims are processed. The immediate challenge for Europe is crisis management: the fiasco in Budapest is just the European leadership problem in microcosm. There is no coherence, no predictability and no urgency. As with Greece, and with the prolonged debt crisis of southern Europe, the institutions move sluggishly until leaders are forced into making flamboyant gestures, and no solution is ever reached. But, as they struggle to achieve coherence and to show compassion, the EU’s leaders are accumulating much bigger risks. An EU into which half a million people can arrive to claim asylum in six months will struggle to justify the same rules and institutions as the Europe that believed its borders were under control. With Dublin III a dead letter, there will have to be a new asylum system based on reality. People will attempt to claim asylum whether they’re victims of war, drought or poverty. Either they’ll be processed in the place they want to settle, or there will have to be mass deportations back to Greece and Hungary – the two countries with the biggest fascist movements in the EU. And if hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers are given leave to remain in a continent where there is stagnation and mass unemployment, what happens to free movement? The home secretary, Theresa May, has already called for it to be constrained in response to the new situation. The EU’s leaders can muddle along with broken institutions, flouted laws, flailing border police. Or they can think it through. The OECD’s central projection is that, to stand a chance of avoiding stagnation, the EU’s workforce will have to add 50 million more people through migration by 2060 (a similar number is needed in the US). The Paris-based thinktank says if that doesn’t happen, it is a “significant downside risk” to growth. What this means should be spelled out, because no politician has bothered to do so: to avoid economic stagnation in the long term, Europe needs migrants. Consent for inward economic migration is fragile and falling – as evidenced by the sudden rush by politicians and tabloids to reclassify the Syrian exodus as a special case. Even if populist resistance to migration stops short of fascism, and even if anti-migration parties are disempowered by the electoral system, their existence highlights a failing consensus. And that is, in turn, founded on economic failure. The Eurozone has produced an arc of stagnation and discontent along its southern border. There is mass unemployment in the very countries that have become the first port of call for migrants and refugees. So the challenge for Europe is clear. To absorb the refugees we are going to need a new set of rules about where they’re processed; new arrangements for internal travel in Europe. Plus a new social consensus about who can come, who can’t and where they are going to live and work. And, ultimately, a massive economic stimulus. If the EU cannot do all this, its constituent nations will begin to do so separately. And so, in the space of a summer, the refugee crisis crashes into the Euro crisis, and the one consistent problem is failure of leadership, anticipation and vision.

2015-10-29T07:03:01Z,Housing associations can help keep refugees off the streets,"When the plight of Syrian refugees made September’s headlines, housing organisations rushed to offer rehousing across Britain. But can they contribute to the government’s resettlement scheme and, if not, how else can they help? Britain is not facing the same pressures as countries in southern and eastern Europe, nor has it taken on the massive responsibility for refugees accepted by Germany or Sweden. While much of the rest of Europe is compelled to deal with the refugee crisis because displaced people are simply turning up at its borders, Britain, an island, is still able to turn people back at Calais so that most never set foot on British soil. This means their only chance to claim asylum is by entering illegally or overstaying their visas, or through the official resettlement scheme that started earlier this year. All Syrians arriving here are likely to have legitimate asylum claims simply because of the violent chaos engulfing their country; some 85% of claims by Syrians are approved (among the highest rates of any nationality). Social landlords can help both those brought through the official scheme and those who simply arrive and make asylum claims. The UN high commissioner for refugees has a worldwide resettlement programme from refugee camps that gives a permanent home to about 80,000 people each year. At 750 people a year, Britain’s contribution has never been more than 1% of the total, though it has resettled the victims of dangerous conflicts in countries such as Burma and Liberia, in cities such as Sheffield and Bradford. The Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme is based on experience with these schemes and so far has taken 216 refugees; most have been housed in Bradford and Coventry. Bradford’s Horton housing association, which has worked with migrant communities for many years, has quickly become the most experienced social landlord at dealing with the Syrian crisis. The government has announced the expansion of its resettlement scheme to cater for 20,000 refugees over five years, aiming to place the first thousand by the end of this year. But the scheme is moving slowly, despite dozens of offers from councils and from the administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Not surprisingly, the main obstacle is money: while the government is offering just one year’s financial support, cash-strapped councils are arguing for more, given that the scheme concentrates on vulnerable people who are likely to take longer to learn English and establish themselves in Britain. The process is complicated. Prospective movers are identified by the UN high commissioner for refugees, vetted by government, then passed to one of the participating local authorities who can accept or reject them. If accepted they will be offered accommodation, which is where social landlords come in. They can make offers of help to the strategic migration partnerships operating in each region, but should expect to have to wait before the offers are taken up. Unlike the official scheme, where those accepted are given five years’ “humanitarian protection” and can then apply for permanent settlement, asylum seekers face months or possibly years of waiting to gain refugee status. In the meantime, most are housed by government contractors and get minimal subsistence funding. Housing providers can help Syrians and other asylum seekers in two ways. First, many fall through the porous safety net and end up destitute. All over the country, local voluntary groups co-ordinated through Naccom provide help through shared housing or “hosting” schemes (where people offer rent-free rooms in their homes). These groups are often looking for extra houses to use. For example, the hope projects in Birmingham have several properties lent to them by housing associations. Several groups would welcome such offers; there’s more information on the strategic alliance on migrant destitution website or in the new Joseph Rowntree Foundation guidance. Housing associations must also make sure they know about refugees’ housing rights and can advise those looking for accommodation, whether with social or private landlords. Unfortunately, the hardships that Syrian and other asylum seekers face do not end when they get accepted as refugees: they are evicted from their Home Office accommodation soon after getting their papers, and many end up on the streets. Without a fixed address, they find it hard to access benefits or get work. No longer eligible even for the minimal support given to asylum seekers, up to 90% face homelessness, according to the Refugee Council. Given that asylum seekers are dispersed across Britain, almost every large town and city has people suffering in this way, desperately in need of social landlords’ help and support. John Perry is policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH). He is running a webinar for CIH members on Monday 2 November on what housing organisations can do to support refugees and migrants.

2015-08-28T15:16:35Z,We deride them as ‘migrants’. Why not call them people? | David Marsh,"What do the following people have in common: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England; the former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen; Nigel Farage’s wife, Kirsten; Chelsea’s new striker, Pedro; and Sir Bradley Wiggins? Yes, they are all migrants – or, if you prefer, immigrants. Having moved to the UK to further their careers, some of them might perhaps be described as “economic migrants”. Except that this term is reserved exclusively by politicians and the media to describe people who – unlike bankers or sports stars – they don’t like: people who, in the words of our foreign secretary, are “marauding” across Europe. People from the UK moving abroad to pursue their career or financial interests, meanwhile, are “expats”, never emigrants or migrants. The language we hear in what passes for a national conversation on migration has become as debased as most of the arguments, until the very word “migrants” is toxic, used to frighten us by conjuring up images of a “swarm” (as David Cameron put it) massing at our borders, threatening our way of life. As Prof Alexander Betts, director of the refugee studies centre at Oxford University, says: “Words that convey an exaggerated sense of threat can fuel anti-immigration sentiment and a climate of intolerance and xenophobia.” There’s nothing new in this. Fifteen years ago the Conservatives were getting worked up about “bogus asylum seekers”. This was nonsense: you are either an asylum seeker or you aren’t. But that wasn’t the point – which was, rather than to demonstrate the traditional British values of compassion and fairness to those seeking refuge here, to denigrate them for crude political purposes. This is the background against which Al Jazeera English has announced it will no longer use the word “migrants” but “refugees”, in the context of desperate people trying to enter Europe by the Mediterranean. The broadcaster’s online editor, Barry Malone, says: “It is not hundreds of people who drown when a boat goes down in the Mediterranean, nor even hundreds of refugees. It is hundreds of migrants. The umbrella term migrant is no longer fit for purpose when it comes to describing the horror unfolding in the Mediterranean … Migrant is a word that strips suffering people of voice.” Newspapers such as the Guardian have been using “migrant” in recent years in part because something similar happened to the word “immigrant”, when it became increasingly used by racists to mean something like “a black person in Britain who should go back home”. In fact “immigrate” simply means to arrive in a country, as “emigrate” means to leave one. But it’s hard to use the former in a neutral context because it has become so loaded, along with phrases such as “second-generation immigrant”, an offensive way to refer to their children. Journalists, like politicians, prefer to keep a story simple, assuming readers and voters have a short attention span. Labels such as “migrants”, however, deny people their humanity, and somewhere in this sorry saga we are losing sight of the fact they are people. So when the Express used the headline “Eight million migrants live in UK” this week I’m not absolutely sure who they were referring to, or whether the figure is accurate, and I don’t think they are either. But it doesn’t really matter because the idea is to alarm, not inform, the public and propagate an agenda that says: migrants = bad; (and then to blame the European Union). I’ve been canvassing opinion among Guardian colleagues to assess the language we use when writing about this international crisis. One colleague who has been reporting extensively on the situation in Calais says: “The conclusion I came to was, wherever possible, to describe those in the camp as ‘people’ initially, with an extended phrase along the lines of ‘more than 3,000 people who have fled war, poverty or persecution beyond Europe’s borders …’.” Another journalist says: “They are people – men, women and children, fathers and mothers, teachers and engineers, just like us – except they come from Syria, Eritrea, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Why not just call them ‘people’, then list any other information we know that is relevant?” We deserve better from our politicians and press than scare stories about hordes of migrants laying siege to the UK. Such language not only plays to people’s fears, it is far from accurate. The vast majority come into the country legally. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees considers people at Calais at the very least “people of concern” – vulnerable individuals likely to have a claim for asylum. Globally nearly 60 million people have been forcibly displaced. It’s fair to say that most of them are not in it to take advantage of the British benefits system. You will still see the word “migrants” or “migration” in the Guardian as a general expression to cover people who for whatever reason have moved, or are moving, from the country of which they are nationals to another. But “refugees”, “displaced people” and “asylum seekers”, all of which have clear definitions, are more useful and accurate terms than a catch-all label like “migrants”, and we should use them wherever possible. Politically charged expressions such as “economic migrants”, “genuine refugees” or “illegal asylum seekers” should have no part in our coverage. This is a story about humanity. Reporting it should be humane as well as accurate. Sadly, most of what we hear and read about “migrants” is neither."
2015-12-13T00:05:08Z,We need a stronger response to the refugee crisis | Yvette Cooper,"Calling for support for refugees has got harder. People across Britain want to help but, as winter draws in, the problems feel endless and the answers hard. A long shadow has been cast by the terrible Paris attacks. In France, Marine Le Pen and the Front National are on the rise. David Cameron has warned that anxiety over the refugee crisis could drive people towards Brexit. So it would be easy to conclude that the refugee crisis is just too difficult and that Britain should stay on the sidelines instead. But we can’t. The crisis isn’t going away and the Guardian and Observer are right to make this the subject of their Christmas appeal. For the sake of our common humanity, our social cohesion and security, we need a stronger response. For a start, more people are suffering as winter starts to bite. Tens of thousands of people in Greece and the Balkans are sleeping in the cold without proper shelter or sanitation. Closer to home, people are living in draughty tents in the rain and mud ofnorthern France. Medics I met in Calais this week say scabies and bronchitis are rife. I talked to 12-year-old Afghan boys alone with no parents or family, desperately vulnerable to trafficking gangs. Aid workers say Dunkirk is now worse – 2,000 Iraqi Kurds, half of them women and children, left by smugglers in an empty wasteground. Unless this crisis is properly managed, the escalating chaos is going to become ever more dangerous too. Gangs make a fortune trading in lives. Women and children are forced into the sex trade. Teenage boys are offered cheap passage if they will carry drugs or weapons. Terrorists can exploit the chaos too, travelling the same routes as the refugees who flee their violence. Our own safety and security depend on Europe getting a better grip. Nor should fear of the far right, or concern for social cohesion, stop us from acting. Because it is the sense of disorder and chaos that Le Pen and others exploit. At the same time Islamic State extremists want nothing more than to poison Europe’s hearts against refugees, to create the social tensions that make it easier for them to recruit. If we want to stop social cohesion being undermined, we need to show that governments can manage this crisis – restoring order and showing compassion at the same time. So what more does that mean Britain should be pressing for now? First, we need a major new co-ordinated humanitarian relief programme for Europe’s main crisis points – led by the UNHCR. In places such as Lesbos, Idomeni, Calais or Dunkirk, small groups of volunteers do their best, but the biggestproblem is lack of leadership to co-ordinate the relief. Second, we need a proper system of assessments to see who needs support and who should be returned home. It still isn’t happening on Lesbos. And if the French won’t do it in Calais, we should insist the UNHCR are brought in instead. Third, we need stronger controls and security assessments to prevent criminals and extremists exploiting the crisis. Schengen should be ditched and border checks within Europe restored. Finally, we need more action to prevent people starting dangerous journeys. That includes support for refugees in the region, and work to end the Syrian conflict. But it also means developing safe and managed alternatives to the current chaos.For example Britain should give sanctuary to some of the abandoned child refugees just as we helped with the Kindertransport. And we should help more refugee families who have been torn apart. The single mother I met in Calais who fled Syria with two small children after her husband was killed is desperate to reach her closest remaining relatives, her father and brother, who live in London. We should prevent families like hers travelling to Calais with a proper legal system they can apply to instead. None of this is easy. But ignoring the problem or hoping other countries will solve it will only make it worse. This is the biggest humanitarian challenge Europe has faced since the second world war. We have no choice but to act."
2015-12-25T13:26:47Z,We Stand Together: the Guardian and Observer charity appeal continues,"The Guardian and Observer We Stand Together charity appeal was inspired in part by our reporting from the frontline of the refugee crisis. In this post we look at some of the things we’ve learned from our coverage of the refugee crisis over the past few weeks. 1) We read the moving and harrowing testimonies of refugees risking their lives at sea. Zoe Williams, the Guardian columnist, wrote in Lesbos: From the top of the cliffs, local people, volunteers and medics watch the boats making their precarious way over the strait. Every so often, you see something come off, and hope to God that it’s a bag. People sometimes jump out to save the rest of the dinghy. At a certain point, the Greek coastguards go out to guide them over, helped by Spanish and Danish volunteers on jetskis. There are so many rocks, and the dinghies are so flimsy, that nobody is safe until they’re right up against the coast. 2) One of the charities we are sponsoring, Migrant Offshore Aid Station, has rescued nearly 12,000 people since it was set up by Regina and Chris Catrambone last year. Patrick Kingsley, the Guardian migration correspondent, wrote: To reach the sea, refugees need first to place their lives in the hands of Libya’s people smugglers, many of whom are just as brutal as the jihadi. Smugglers often torture their so-called customers until they pay for the cost of the boat trip – and female migrants are treated worst of all. Onboard the Moas ship, women described to Catrambone how they were separated from their husbands and then abused. ‘They’d be put into a small room,’ says Catrambone, who gives pastoral care while onboard, ‘and then during the night, men would come in and rape them.’ One woman said that she would bite into her clothes so that her child, sleeping next to her, would not hear her screams. 3) Suzanne Moore saw people living in a lawless and disease-ridden camp near Dunkirk, witnessing their sheer will to survive. From her piece we read of the conditions in the Jungle, the refugee camp in Calais, and the medical aid the Doctors of the World charity is providing. The conditions of these ‘camps’ don’t meet any basic UN humanitarian standards. At the main camp, called the Jungle, the Doctors of the World clinic, which is basically three sheds, has been broken into and looted. Everything here is dangerous. Fires start as candles tip over. Trapped, desperate people do desperate things. The cold and fear get inside your bones. A doctor chats to me between consultations. He says: ‘They [the refugees] become weaker and weaker. There is malnutrition. The immune system falls.’ He puts his hand to his chest. ‘I don’t know how to say it in English. I worry for their spirits breaking.’ 4) We learned how Paddington Bear, the fictional Peruvian character who travels to London in search of a home, is helping pupils welcome refugees as part of a City of Sanctuary schools project. Tracy McVeigh reports: The story of how the Brown family of Windsor Gardens sheltered a homeless migrant, as detailed in author Michael Bond’s books, is being used in schools around the country to help primary pupils understand why people leave their homes and the difficulties they face. Rose McCarthy, coordinator of the Schools of Sanctuary scheme, an arm of one of the Guardian and Observer’s Christmas Appeal charities, City of Sanctuary, said: ‘Paddington works really well for young children.’ 5) While the NHS cries out for doctors, the expertise of health professionals seeking asylum in Britain is going to waste. Building Bridges, a Refugee Council scheme, is trying to heal the divide. Gary Younge writes about the refugee doctors battling for acceptance: The Building Bridges programme, run by the Refugee Council with help from the NHS and other charities, was set up to make these transitions happen. The NHS needs doctors. These doctors, who are refugees, need work. This scheme provides the connection by supporting refugee health professionals to requalify to UK standards. As well as helping them navigate the bureaucracy of the General Medical Council, providing language support, clinical attachments and a general support network, they also have retired volunteer doctors to talk them through the likely scenarios they will encounter on the job. He adds: Soraya Azimi, for example, is an Afghan doctor who has studied in Russia, trained in the Netherlands and practised in Afghanistan – until the Taliban made that untenable. To satisfy the GMC she had to gather documents from all three countries. The search went on for months. ‘Without the help of Building Bridges I couldn’t go any further,’ she says. 6) Homa Khaleeli spoke to the mothers who have travelled for thousands of miles, carrying their babies in rucksacks and risking dangerous sea crossings. In the Calais Jungle camp, she met the female refugees forced to flee with their children. Khadija, 28, from Iraq, who was with her daughter Mariam, aged one, told her: We went to Greece by boat. It was so dangerous and difficult. We tried five times to get a boat, and each time we were stopped by the police – we lost our belongings as we ran away from them. Finally, we managed it, but when we got to the beach, I could not stop crying. I was really scared. The boat was just a rubber dinghy and it leaked. I thought we would die together in the sea. 7) Diane Taylor spoke to Syrian refugee Ali Mustafa, who passed through 10 countries before reaching the UK. Now he is working at a restaurant in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He said: Jumping the train in Calais was no big deal compared with all the bombing we ran away from. Every day in Syria I used to look up to the sky and see birds and sunshine, fruits and vegetables growing out of the earth and sheep and camels walking on it. When the war started we looked up to the sky and saw only airstrikes and helicopters. When we looked down at the earth we saw only bombs lying on the ground. When the trouble started we fled from Dera to Raqqa. But our house in Raqqa was bombed. I will never forget the screams of one of my daughters who was buried in the rubble. We managed to dig her out and fortunately she survived. 8) Kon Karapanagiotidis who founded the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Australia, told Patrick Butler how the charity has supported more than 10,000 refugees in many different ways, from providing food to helping them seek refugee status and employment. He said: To sacrifice your home and cross the perilous sea to find a safe place to call home for your family is an act of extraordinary courage. To be persecuted because you refuse to live under oppression, to speak out against tyranny knowing it could be your last breath, is truly inspiring. It is life and death that is at stake, where the difference between people caring or not is people dying. I can think of nothing more important to spend my life fighting for and to know these people – people like my grandparents – is a gift. 9) Melissa Davey spoke to the Appathurais family, now living in Australia, who described the help they received from the ASRC to get them on their feet: In 2007 two helicopters carrying foreign diplomats were attacked by militants on the oval by the school where Annete [Appathurais] taught English. The Sri Lankan army retaliated by ramping up attacks on the Tamil Tigers. Stray bullets would hit her classroom and Annete would cower with her students on the floor. She would go home each night to her family and together they would suffer from ‘fearful nights’, Annete remembers, cowering as gunfire filled the air. ‘I try not to remember it,’ she says. She ends the report with: Annete no longer feels frightened when she hears a helicopter, which she used to associate with gunfire; and knows she can freely walk into government buildings, such as police stations, without fear, as well as travel around after dark. Most importantly to her, her children are safe. ‘If we were to go and live in Sri Lanka again, I don’t know what would happen to them,’ Annete says. ‘If they were to go out, I would never be sure that they would come back home.’ 10) We learned of the stadium in Athens that is full of displaced people – and how a team of doctors is working flat out to ease their plight. Tracy McVeigh reports: Amina is eight years old and running a fever. In her thinly padded pink anorak, hood pulled up over her curls and pallid face, she watches listlessly from the couch as her parents listen carefully to the doctor’s instructions over her medication. In another place, in another city, at another time, perhaps, this sick child would be taken home to be tucked up in bed with hot drinks. But Amina has no home any more and tonight her bed is a grey donated blanket on the concrete floor of the tae kwon do stadium in Athens. Once this building was the pride of Greece’s 2004 Olympics; this weekend it is a squalid, cold place full of desperate people. The proceeds of the Guardian’s We Stand Together appeal will go to six charities supporting refugees across the world: Red Cross, Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas), Doctors of the World, Refugee Council, City of Sanctuary and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.

2015-05-28T18:30:10Z,Asian refugee crisis: trafficked migrants held off Thailand in vast 'camp boats',"Thousands of Bangladeshi and ethnic Rohingya migrants are being held in huge cargo ships by human traffickers in the Andaman Sea, according to testimony collected from survivors. First-hand accounts indicate that trafficking syndicates trading in vulnerable migrants have responded to a recent crackdown by authorities in Thailand and Malaysia by holding their victims in large vessels close to international waters, where they are ransomed for their freedom in return for money from relatives. The practice, which has been accompanied by violence and other abuses, mirrors the fate of victims held in camps recently discovered by officials in southern Thailand and Malaysia, where dozens of mass graves have yet to be unearthed according to survivors who spoke to the Arakan Project. There is one crucial difference, however: the bodies of the dead were dumped overboard into the ocean, with no hope of being recovered.“The traffickers will not abandon their business, so they have now started putting ‘camps’ in the sea,” said Chris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project. “Since the end of February, we now have thousands and thousands of people stuck at sea, and I think we already have more death than even at the camps in Thailand.” A survivor from one ship who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity described an ordeal of violence and sexual abuse accompanied by demands for ransom payment. She described a ship containing “six storeys in total: three above deck, three below. The men and women were separated.”As a result of this arrangement, the women on the ship were targeted by sexually predatory crew members, she claimed. A girl “around 12 years old” who was “very beautiful” was taken to a room by a group of men and was “not released from the ship”, she recalled. Other women onboard were subjected to similar treatment, she said, adding: “If the women did not go, they were beaten.” Recalling other aspects of her ordeal onboard the vessel, the woman said: “Food rations were not enough … when I asked for more, they beat me.” She was accompanied by her three children during her time on the ship. In other testimony collected by the Arakan Project, a 19-year-old Rohingya man from Burma’s northern Rakhine state described his journey on one of the boats last year. After nine days at sea on a Burmese cattle ship, his vessel joined with a bigger boat not far from the Thai shore. He estimated there were more than 1,000 people onboard, roughly one-third of whom were women. “I spent 14 days on this ship. Three days after we were transferred, three smugglers arrived from Malaysia and boarded our ship. They carried mobile phones. They first asked who had phone numbers and, one by one, we started calling our relatives. Those [who did not provide] phone numbers were beaten,” he recalled. “The smugglers ordered passengers to beat them with engine chains wrapped in plastic and plastic pipes with something heavy inside. Even those with phone numbers were beaten,” he said. The abuses continued until families sent money, after which survivors were taken to shore by small fishing boats. “Before I left, I witnessed three men who had become paralysed and one dead body was thrown overboard,” he added. A survivor from northern Thailand who spoke to the Guardian by phone described similar treatment. “I stayed on the boats for three months from February this year until April. I remember people were beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day. Those who could not pay were beaten. “I think there were more than one-and-a-half thousand people on that boat,” he estimated. Abdul Kalam, an adviser to Thai police, told Channel 4 News that refugees were being taken offshore for months. He said that a tanker ship has been deployed as a camp. “It has been out for two months and is moving all the time. The ship has got 2,000 people on it. The traffickers are relocating their camps because so much money is involved.” The testimony of survivors has been reinforced by the accounts of Rohingya helped to shore by fishermen in north and east Aceh, Indonesia, after being stranded at sea. Visitors to the tightly-controlled camps containing the refugees heard multiple accounts of the use of large “camp boats” at sea. “I have just spent a week in Aceh working in three camps with my local humanitarian team, and we have conducted interviews with dozens of Rohingya and Bangladeshi survivors. Many of them spoke of being held in offshore camps on big ships in international waters,” said Lilianne Fan, a research associate with the Humanitarian Policy Group. Htike Htike, co-founder of the Bangkok-based Equal Harmony Together project, who also went to Aceh, offered a similar account. “ I conducted 30 interviews in Aceh. During that time many people spoke of the use of ‘camp boats’ where they were forced to call their family to ask for money,” she said.A 15-year-old survivor recalled seeing 34 people die from sickness during a 40-day stay onboard one of the huge camp vessels. “Crew members threw the dead bodies overboard,” he said. He even saw the dead from other ships. “About the 20th day of waiting in the Andaman Sea, another two cargo boats arrived. They were smaller than our boat and they anchored near our boat … I saw people who had died in those two boats: eight bodies were thrown overboard from one boat and the following day another 13 bodies were thrown from the other boat. I do not know how they had died.” This article was amended on 29 May 2015. The original stated that Rohingya had been helped by fishermen in Banda Aceh. This has been changed to north and east Aceh."
2015-11-27T15:53:42Z,EU seeks to buy Turkish help with migrants at controversial summit,"European leaders are to stage an unprecedented and highly controversial summit with the Turkish government on Sunday in an attempt to outsource the migration crisis, paying Ankara €3bn for it to seal its border with Greece to halt or slow migrant flows to Europe. The Turks, who demanded the summit, have insisted on a high price fortheir cooperation: the resumption of EU membership negotiations after years of them being frozen, easing of visa requirements for Turks travelling to the EU, regular EU-Turkey summits, and the €3bn (£2.1bn) in aid over two years. “The amount of money we’re offering is ludicrous,” said an ambassador from one of the bigger countries in the EU. “We’re on our knees begging the Turks to close their border.” The sentiment is widespread among policymakers in Brussels and EU capitals, with scepticism high about the merits of trying to strike a deal with Turkey’s authoritarian and mercurial president, Recep Tayipp Erdoğan, who has been criticised for his human rights record. Another two journalists were arrested in Turkey this week after publishing reports about Turkish arms supplies to jihadis in Syria. “Do you know anyone who believes Erdoğan will deliver?” asked another senior diplomat, while a top EU policymaker said the EU was “trapped”. But the strategy of buying Turkish cooperation in the refugee crisis is being driven by domestic politics in several EU countries, most notably Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel cannot be seen to back down publicly on her open-door policy towards immigrants, but needs some respite in the form of slowing down the flow and gaining some control over the chaos. Erdoğan, Berlin believes, can supply that political safety valve. The EU has never held a full summit of 28 leaders with another non-member country. It is doing so only because Ankara insisted. Even more confusingly and embarrassingly, it remained unclear on Friday morning who would represent Ankara – Erdoğan or the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu. It would be the latter, it was later confirmed. The European commission has drawn up the policy in a hurry in recent weeks on Germany’s behalf. It is not clear where the €3bn will come from and negotiations in Brussels on the funding have barely begun. Britain, seldom the first to offer money for European projects, is the only country in the EU to have made a concrete pledge of €400m, while €500m is earmarked to come from the EU budget, leaving more than €2bn to be raised. Turkey is hosting more than 2 million Syrian refugees and it is the biggest source of migrants into the EU, with about 700,000 crossing the Aegean into Greece and then trekking across the Balkans this year. “This is not money for Turkey. It’s money for the refugees,” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s chief foreign policy coordinator, told the Guardian. “You have to support the communities there or you face social collapse.” The proposed deal with Ankara would see the Turks patrolling the Aegean borders to the Greek islands to stem the flow of migrants, cracking down on the smuggling mafias running the trade, but would also at a later stage entail the EU agreeing to take hundreds of thousands of bona fide refugees annually from Turkey and resettle them across Europe. The figure mentioned in Berlin is 500,000 per year. They would be shared under a new system of permanent, binding EU quotas, according to Merkel. This would trigger a colossal row in the EU, with several countries reluctant to pay Turkey and even less keen to accept the quotas. Merkel warned this week that Europe’s 26-country free-travel zone, known as Schengen, would not survive unless she got her way. According to senior diplomats, EU policymakers have concluded that Schengen will be in its terminal phase within months unless European governments gain greater control over the pace and scale of immigration from the Middle East."

2015-08-31T15:42:33Z,Why I swam across the Mediterranean in solidarity with refugees | Nina Hall,"Last Friday, I swam from Turkey to Greece in solidarity with the refugees who are making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean into Europe. I crossed from Kaş, a Turkish resort town where European tourists flock in the summer, into Greek waters near Kastellorizo, a Greek island 5km kilometres off the coast of Turkey. The crossing is near where many refugees have crossed the Mediterranean in recent months. The situation here is tense. Earlier in August, refugees were locked in a stadium on Kos and the Greek government sent riot police to deal with refugee protests. So why did I do this swim? I was motivated, first, by a deep concern that thousands of people are drowning off the coast of Italy and Libya, being tear-gassed in Macedonia, blocked by razor wire on the Hungarian border. I am concerned that many European governments are responding with force to people who have risked everything for the sake of survival. Many have faced brutal conflict in Syria or repressive governments in Eritrea. I talked with a Syrian refugee in Berlin who described getting on a small, overloaded boat in the Aegean last August. He left at midnight, and during the crossing the boat filled with water and there was no way of bailing it out. Those on board were saved by Greek authorities. Thousands of others have not been so fortunate. I am also driven by my own research on the evolution of global refugee and migration governance. In times of great need for Europe, the rest of the world was willing to take European refugees and migrants. Let’s rewind 70 years, when Europe was devastated by war and had massive refugee populations. What did the world do? In 1950, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was created and the Refugee Convention was established the following year; thousands of European refugees were then accepted on to the soil of other states. These institutions oblige states to offer protection and assistance to refugees. A lesser-known fact: the Refugee Convention was meant only for refugees fleeing persecution in European countries; it was created to help Europe. In fact, it was only in 1967 that the limited geographic scope was removed and people from Africa, Asia and the Americas could also be considered refugees. Today, the Refugee Convention legally obliges Europe to offer protection and assistance to all those entering its territory. Refugees cannot be returned to their country of origin. After the second world war, Latin America, North America, Australia and New Zealand also accepted European migrants. In 1951 the US established what became the International Organisation for Migration, which helped people migrate from southern Europe to Australia and the Americas. In fact, European migrants have for centuries benefited from being able to move offshore. In the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of migrants left the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Greece. Some fled persecution or famine – think of the millions of Irish people who emigrated after the potato famine. Some looked for better job opportunities in cities from Sydney to Chicago. What is overlooked in current debates is how much Europe benefited from the creation of global refugee and migration institutions after the war and the openness of other countries to accept refugees and migrants. Europe should do the same today. I am driven by a hope that those of us living in Europe will view refugees as beneficial to society. European leaders should view this “crisis” as an opportunity to benefit from refugees’ skills. Europe needs workers, skilled and unskilled (migrants and refugees often do the jobs that no other locals want to do), and the people coming to Europe today have many assets. Research suggests that migration generally has a positive effect on economic growth. The Syrian refugee I met in Berlin had studied English literature and was planning to pursue tertiary studies at Wing’s, which offers online university courses free to refugees. His brother is a dental technician and last week began working in Berlin. My swim from Turkey to Greece was only a few kilometres long, and nothing compared to the distance, uncertainties and challenges that many refugees face on their way to Europe. European leaders should realise that refugees are far from being just a burden to taxpayers, but bring great benefits. European governments also have a legal and moral responsibility to assist refugees. They are legally obliged to do so by the Refugee Convention and by the historical record. Europe and its people once benefitted enormously from others’ openness – now it’s time European leaders stopped using force, opened up Europe’s borders, and all of us living in Europe welcomed refugees."
2015-08-31T16:47:53Z,Italian politicians seize on asylum seeker's alleged role in murder,"The brutal murder of an elderly couple in Sicily has become a political issue in Italy following the arrest of an African asylum seeker who was allegedly implicated in the killings. The accused killer, 18-year-old Mamadou Kamara from the Ivory Coast, has been a resident of the Mineo refugee centre in Sicily – the largest such facility in Europe – since 8 June. According to Italian media reports, Kamara was arrested on Sunday after he was found entering Mineo with a bag containing a phone that allegedly belonged to the victims. His pants were allegedly stained with blood. One victim, Victor Solano, 68, was found in his nearby home with his throat slit and his Spanish wife, Mercedes Ibanez, 70, was found in the courtyard of the couple’s apartment building, having apparently fallen from the balcony. The daughter of the victims, Rosita Solano, blamed the Italian government for the murders, saying it allowed “immigrants to come here and do what they want, even rob and kill us”. She singled out the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, and interior minister, Angelino Alfano, who have resisted political pressure from some critics to stop saving tens of thousands of migrants who have attempted the treacherous crossing from northern Africa to Italy’s southern shore. “Renzi, come here and explain it to me,” she said in a video interview with La Repubblica. Anti-immigrant politicians, led by Matteo Salvini, the head of the rightwing Northern League, seized on the remarks. “From what war was this guy escaping??? If he’s guilty, jail for life, with HARD LABOUR!,” Salvini said on Twitter and his Facebook page. He called for the immediate closure of the migrant centre in Mineo. Another rightwing politician from the Fratelli d’Italia party called on Renzi to explain himself to the victims’ daughter, saying the Mineo migrant reception centre was not properly monitored. The mayor of Palagonia, where the murders took place, took a more measured tone, saying more police patrols were needed “migrants or not”, because the area required more security. More than 100,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Italy this year, tens of thousands of whom have been rescued by Italian and other European rescue crews. Migrants generally have not faced a hostile reception in Italy, but there have been some incidents over the past few months of violence and antagonism against the new arrivals provoked by unsubstantiated claims the migrants are violent and dangerous. The murders in Sicily are likely to fuel anger and concern among some Italians who say the wave of new migrants poses a domestic security risk. The political tensions in Italy come as EU interior and justice ministers said they would meet in two weeks in Brussels to find “concrete steps” to cope with the escalating migration issue. Renzi said on Sunday that he believed the EU would adopt a set of uniform rules for refugees, replacing a patchwork of laws."
2015-09-15T16:30:50Z,Refugee crisis: Hungary rejects all asylum requests made at border – as it happened,"The Associated Press has said it is protesting the brief detention of one of its journalists, cameraman Luca Muzi, by Hungarian police as he covered migrants crossing the border, saying he was forced to delete footage that included images of a police dog knocking down a refugee. The officers took Muzi to a dark area outside a migrant registration center and demanded to see Muzi’s footage, then told him to delete it, he said. The footage contained two days of work in Serbia and Hungary. Muzi said he was compelled to delete the tape while feeling menaced by muzzled police dogs nearby. Hungary has disputed the account, AP said. Hungary says it has rejected all 16 asylum requests made under the new border regime on its southern frontier with Serbia within hours. Another 32 claims are being processed and 174 people are to be prosecuted for crossing the border illegally, Viktor Orban’s security advisor said. Serbia has warned that it will be unable to cope with being the “centre of arrivals” for refugees, including those sent back from Hungary and others flowing in from Greece and Macedonia. It urged the EU to come up with a coherent plan. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, said that Hungary’s decision effectively to seal its border to refugees meant there was an immediate need to help Serbia cope with the expected logjam Hungary’s government has confirmed plans to extend its border fence with Serbia to its much longer border with Romania. Austria has officially notified the European Commission that it will temporarily reintroduce controls its borders with Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Slovenia at midnight. The commission said Austria’s move, like that of Germany, was in keeping with the provisions of the Schengen agreement: German chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany’s decision to reintroduce border controls was necessary for an orderly regime, and together with her Austrian counterpart called for a European summit on the crisis. Migrants and asylum seekers have staged protests at Hungary’s border with Serbia after the Hungarian government launched a new anti-immigration crackdown. Under the new laws migrants face arrest and fast-track deportation to Serbia. The United Nations says it is “deeply disappointed” at the failure of European Union interiors ministers to reach a final consensus on a plan to relocate of 120,000 refugees. “Decisive agreement is needed without further delay to address the needs, as is bold action based on solidarity from all member states,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. At least 22 migrants, including four children, were killed trying to reach Greece by boat. They drown when their vessel sank off Turkey’s southwest coast, local media reported. More than half a million migrants have appeared at Europe borders in the first eight months of the year, according to the EU’s border agency Frontex. It announced five consecutive monthly records in the numbers of people reported, with the figure for August alone climbing to 156,000. The European Commission said it has received a notification from the Austrian authorities informing about their intention to temporarily reintroduce controls its borders with Hungary (which it announced yesterday), Italy, Slovakia and Slovenia. The commission said Austria’s move, like that of Germany, was in keeping with the provisions of the Schengen agreement: The temporary reintroduction of border controls between Member States is an exceptional possibility explicitly foreseen in and regulated by the Schengen Borders Code, in case of a crisis situation. The current situation in Austria, prima facie, appears to be a situation covered by the rules. Having already warned that it would not accept anyone turned back from Hungarian territory, Serbia has warned that it is unable to become the “centre of arrivals” for migrants and called on the European Union to sort out the migration crisis. Serbian foreign minister Ivica Dacic told reporters in Prague: This is a serious crisis for the EU which must treat it seriously and with a clear plan. The idea of returning all migrants to Serbia, with others flowing in from Greece and Macedonia, is unacceptable, because we would then become the centre of arrivals. We would like to be part of the solution to the problem, but this can’t be to our detriment. Serbia cannot handle this. Hungary has said that migrants whose asylum applications it rejects will be returned to Serbia. Austria is to introduce tougher border controls at its border with Hungary from midnight (11pm BST), Reuters is reporting, citing an interior ministry spokesman. Austria’s interior minister has informed the European Commission of the move, the spokesman said, adding that the new measures might be extended to other Austrian border regions depending on the numbers of migrants trying to enter. He declined to give details as to what the new controls would involve. The move comes two days after Germany put in place stricter controls, slowing the flow of migrants across its border. Here are a couple of pictures from the Hungary/Serbia border: Journalist Matthew Cassel is tweeting from the Hungary/Serbia border The authorities in Scotland have confirmed they will house at least 2,000 refugees after the UK government came under heavy, cross-party pressure at Holyrood to speed up and increase its offer to take 20,000 Syrian refugees, writes Severin Carrell. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish minister for Europe and international development, confirmed that the Scottish government would help house 10% of the total number of refugees accepted by the UK after Labour urged him to increase an initial offer to take 1,000 people displaced by the conflict. Yousaf told MSPs that Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, had made it “very clear that 1,000 refugees coming to Scotland should be seen as a minimum and very much an initial, immediate figure – it is not a cap or a limit, nor is it spread out over five years like the announcement made by the prime minister last week.” The Scottish government’s refugee task force agreed on Tuesday to set up a new website, http://www.scotlandwelcomesrefugees.scot/ with the Scottish Refugee Council, to coordinate responses, Yousaf said. Claire Baker, Scottish Labour’s democracy spokeswoman, echoed his complaint that the 20,000 person ceiling and five year time scale set by David Cameron, the prime minister, was unacceptably low and ungenerous. There were 3,000 unaccompanied children caught in the wave of refugees now in Europe. “On the refugee crisis the UK government has been reacting rather than leading. It is therefore important that we, as a parliament, should not stop applying pressure on Downing Street,” Baker said. Hungary says it has ruled on 16 asylum requests under the new border regime on its southern frontier with Serbia, rejecting all 16 within a matter of hours, Reuters reports. Another 32 claims were filed and were being processed, Gyorgy Bakondi, security advisor to right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a news conference. He said 174 people had been caught crossing the border illegally and would face criminal prosecution. Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that Hungary’s decision effectively to seal its border to refugees meant there was an immediate need to help Serbia cope with the expected logjam, writes Ian Traynor. With 4,000 passing through Serbia every day hoping to get into Hungary, Guterres said Belgrade would not be able to manage the situation. “There is a need for an emergency plan to support Serbia,” he told a press conference in Brussels. Turning back refugees from the EU into the Balkans was “legally, morally and physically unacceptable,” he added. Guterres also voiced deep disappointment with the meagre results of Monday’s emergency meeting of the EU interior ministers and its failure to agree on a system of quotas spreading 120,000 across the union. It was clear in the fallout from the Monday meeting that the person happiest with the result was Viktor Orban, the hardline Hungarian prime minister. Orban feels vindicated that the EU has shifted from illusory resettlement aims to tougher ‘Fortress Europe’ policies aimed at securing borders, keeping migrants out, and pressuring third countries to stem the flow of refugees. The Hungarian government claims that most of those trying to enter are ‘economic migrants’ and not bona fide refugees, and that some are falsely claiming to be Syrians. The vast majority will not be admitted and those who are allowed to claim asylum will probably be deported back to Serbia, officials say. Guterres said the biggest change in migration patterns this year was the “massive increase” in the numbers of Syrians trying to get to Europe, 83% of those entering Greece and proceeding up the Balkan route. The EU’s Frontex borders agency on Tuesday said that three out of four entering Greece and heading for Hungary last month were Syrians. Some Syrians have managed to make it Germany via Hungary by dodging the Hungarian authorities. Saleh Ismael, a 28-year-old from the worn torn Syrian city of Homs, told the Guardian’s Mona Mahmood that he tried to evade detection by hiding in the Hungarian woods. Speaking from a refugee camp in the German city of Wurzburg he said: I feel lost and disappointed after leaving Turkey and coming here. The German people are good and we are grateful for their hospitality, but we came here to get asylum, to know about our future. I hope other countries in the European Union share the burden with Germany and take some refugees. Otherwise it could better for us to back to Greece or Turkey. Germany was my dream from the moment I jumped into the boat to get to Greece. It took a lot of effort to avoid being registered and fingerprinted in Hungary. I hid and walked for days in a forest in the rain. I was frightened of being forced to apply for asylum in Hungary only to be sent back to Greece. In the forest I only had the sound of a train to guide me. Eventually, I was arrested by Hungarian police who put me in jail for two days. I was beaten and kicked for refusing to register as an asylum seeker. When the policeman came to take me to have a fingerprint, he forced my to take off all my clothes. I could not object that and after having a fingerprint, the policeman gave me back only one piece of clothing. After making it to Germany I’m worried I might be sent back to Hungary. Our only demand is to be recognised as human beings who have the right to live in peace and have a family like any other common people in this world. The Czech Republic has blamed Germany for the migration crisis in the latest round of mudslinging. In a Twitter post Czech interior minister Milan Chovanec said: “The current biggest problem of solving migration is an inconsistent policy of Germany. And showing muscles to the neighbors across the border won’t conceal it.” In her press conference German leader Angela Merkel called for greater European co-operation and an end to the blame game. “We cannot manage this challenge by looking at someone else and telling them, ‘you’ve made this mistake’,” she said. The Czech Republic and some other EU countries in the former Eastern bloc have rejected calls from Germany and the EU’s executive Commission for mandatory quotas to share refugees out. Interior ministers of EU nations failed to agree to binding quotas at a meeting on Monday. The UN has expressed alarm at the EU’s inability to come up with a joint system. Peter Sutherland special representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations for Migration, tweeted his frustration. Hungary’s government has confirmed plans to extend its border fence with Serbia to its much longer border with Romania, according to Reuters. “We have made the decision to start preparatory works for the construction of a fence starting from the Hungarian-Serbian-Romanian border at a reasonable length should migration pressure shift in the direction of Romania,” Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference. The migration crisis is one of Europe’s biggest challenges in decades, Merkel said. “We can manage to solve it and we will but only on a common level” Merkel insisted according to translation of her press conference on CNN. Austria’s chancellor, Werner Faymann, criticised Hungary’s border crackdown. We need [border] controls to assess who is entering the country, Merkel said. She pointed out that 70,000 migrants entered Germany from Austria via Hungary last month. Since then Hungary has imposed a new border crackdown. Merkel’s press conference about the refugee crisis is underway. She has defended Germany decision to reintroduce border controls and together with her Austrian counterpart called for a European summit on the crisis. What about Hungary’s border with Romania? asks the Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison. Within minutes there are reports that Hungary is planning another fence on the Romanian border. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: Migrants and asylum seekers have staged protests at Hungary’s border with Serbia after the Hungarian government launched a new anti-immigration crackdown. Under the new laws migrants face arrest and fast-track deportation to Serbia. Opposition politicians and a member of the Serbian government joined those at the border demanding that Hungary reopen crossing points. Serbian minister Aleksandar Vulin said Hungary refused a request to open the border and said his government would not take back those deported from Hungary. Hungary has declared a state of emergency in two of its southern counties bordering Serbia after announcing the arrest of 60 migrants as part of the new crackdown. The measure paves the way for the deployment of the army to assist police with border patrols. The United Nations says it is “deeply disappointed” at the failure of European Union interiors ministers to reach a final consensus on a plan to relocate of 120,000 refugees. “Decisive agreement is needed without further delay to address the needs, as is bold action based on solidarity from all member states,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. At least 22 migrants, including four children, were killed trying to reach Greece by boat. They drown when their vessel sank off Turkey’s southwest coast, local media reported. More than half a million migrants have appeared at Europe borders in the first eight months of the year, according to the EU’s border agency Frontex. It announced five consecutive monthly records in the numbers of people reported, with the figure for August alone climbing to 156,000. Frontier-free travel across Europe continues to unravel as countries re-established border controls in the face of the an unprecedented influx of migrants. Germany’s surprise decision to restore border controls on Sunday had a swift domino effect. Slovakia said it would impose controls on its borders with Hungary and Austria. The Netherlands announced it would make spot checks at its borders. Other EU states from Sweden to Poland said they were monitoring the situation to decide whether controls were needed. Serbian minister Aleksandar Vulin has joined protesters at the Hungarian border, according to ITV’s James Mates. Earlier Vulin warned that Serbia would not accept anyone turned back from Hungarian territory. He was quoted as saying: “That’s no longer our responsibility. They are on Hungarian territory and I expect the Hungarian state to behave accordingly towards them.” Angela Merkel had been due to give a press conference this morning after her meeting about the refugee crisis with her Austria counterpart Werner Faymann. That meeting has taken place, according to a tweet from her spokesman, and the press conference is due to begin any minute now. Hungary’s crackdown on migrants crossing its southern frontier could breach its obligations under United Nations and European Union rules on refugees and asylum, the International Organisation for Migration told Reuters. Hungary “has obligations to follow which it looks like this new legislation would be a contravention of,” Magdalena Majkowska-Tomkin, head of the Hungary office of the IOM told Reuters. “Both the international UN conventions on the status of refugees, but also EU legislation regarding asylum and also regarding criminal procedures.” Majkowska-Tomkin said the IOM saw scope for a legal challenge to the new rules. “From my perspective Hungary needs to respect its international obligations and allow people to claim asylum and provide facilities for them that are adequate for their condition.” The aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières says one of its three boats in the Mediterranean has rescued 119 people stranded on a rubber boat. Earlier, AFP reported the deaths of at least 22 migrants, including four children, trying to reach Greece by boat. They drowned when their vessel sank off Turkey’s south-west coast, local media reported. Turkish coastguards recovered nine more bodies, bringing the toll to 22, and rescued 211 migrants from the wooden boat, which set off from the south-western resort town of Datca for the nearby Greek island of Kos, Dogan news agency reported. Rescue efforts were still continuing, according to the news agency. The number of migrants who are losing their lives in the Mediterranean continues to increase dramatically, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Over this past weekend, and through the first days of this week, an estimated 72 migrants have lost their lives in their attempt to cross into the Greek islands from Turkey. Additionally, IOM Turkey received data from the Turkish Coast Guard indicating some 13 migrants already have died in Turkish waters through the beginning of September, making this month the deadliest on that stretch of the Mediterranean in two years. Here is a clip of migrants and refugees at Hungary’s border with Serbia demanding that the authorities “open” the new barrier. Former boxing champion Amir Khan is leading an aid convoy to help refugees arriving in Lesbos. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, the 28-year-old says he had been inspired to get involved by the sight of innocent people suffering. The convoy has been organised by the Amir Khan Foundation and Penny Appeal. Serbia has warned it would not accept anyone turned back from Hungarian territory. “That’s no longer our responsibility,” Aleksandar Vulin, the minister in charge of policy on migrants, told the Tanjug state news agency, according to Reuters. “They are on Hungarian territory and I expect the Hungarian state to behave accordingly towards them.” Vulin also said that Serbia was not consulted about Hungary’s border crackdown, according to Szabolcs Panyi from the Hungarian news site Indexhu. Hungarian authorities say they detained 60 migrants for attempting to illegally enter the country’s southern border with Serbia by breaching a razor-wire fence, AP reports. Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Prime Minister Viktor Orban, said the authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the southern border and 15 deeper in the country. They got across by damaging the fence and are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offences under the new laws. The authorities are repairing the spots where the fence was damaged, Bakondi told a news conference. Here’s that live feed of the scene at Hungary’s border with Serbia. Tension appears to be escalating at Hungary’s border with Serbia. Reuters says hundreds of migrants are pushing at the border gates blocking the motorway from Serbia. Loudspeaker announcements can be heard on a Reuters live feed from the border. Fergal Keane provides translations of the announcements. Meanwhile, some people have declared a hunger strike in protest at the new border crackdown. Hungary’s decision to declare a state of emergency at its border with Serbia paves the way for the deployment troops to migrants entering the country, according to AP. Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military. However, Associated Press reporters at the border have already spotted heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border in recent days. It also has more on the protests at the border. There were chaotic scenes at the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a small temporary office to process people on the edge of no man’s land and crowds tried to squeeze inside. A first group of about 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside. A group of migrants also blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they will refuse food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary. The sit-in protest is happening on the no man’s land between Roszke and Horgos, Serbia, which is the main border crossing between the two countries. People are forming a “human blockade” in protest at the physical blockade at Hungary’s border with Serbia, according to the BBC’s Fergal Keane. Refugees have begun protesting at the border crackdown at Hungary’s crossing with Serbia, according to reporters at the scene. More than half a million migrants have appeared at Europe borders in the first eight months of the year, according to the EU’s border agency Frontex. It also announced five consecutive monthly records in the numbers of people reported, with the figure for August alone climbing to 156,000. The Greek islands again saw the biggest number of detections in August at 88 000, an 11-fold rise compared to the same month last year. Nearly three-quarters of the people arriving from Turkey were Syrians. “The Greek islands continue to be under an intense migratory pressure. Just last week Frontex offered additional staff to help identify and register the new arrivals on Lesbos and Kos, which have been particularly affected,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. A large number of the migrants arriving in Greece make their way towards Hungary, where the number of detections at its border with Serbia increased 20-fold to more than 52 000 in August, bringing the number so far this year to more than 155 000. Some 171,000 people have claimed asylum in Hungary in last three months, Bakondi said. So far only 300 asylum claims have been granted and 4,000 people have been deported. The procedure on a further 65,000 claims was stopped after those applying “disappeared”, Bakondi said. He added that another 95,000 claims are still being processed. Bakondi said 66,896 Syrians had crossed into Hungary in the last three months. But he pointed out that nationals from 74 others countries had also entered Hungary. They included more 32,900 from Afghanistan and 3,630 from Iraq. Bakondi described yesterday’s record figure of 9,380 arrivals as “huge influx”. Hungary has declared a state of emergency in two of its southern counties bordering Serbia, according to government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs. The measure paves the way for the deployment of the army to assist police with border patrol and migrant-related duties he said told a press conference in Szeged. Fifteen people have been arrested for damaging Hungary’s new border fence, an official has announced. Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to the Hungarian prime minister, also confirmed that a “transit zone” has been set up at Hungary’s border with Serbia. Those applying for asylum in the zone will be sent back to Serbia, he said. The legal status of the transit zone is not the same as entering Hungarian territory, Bakondi explained. The United Nations says its “deeply disappointed” at the failure of European Union interiors ministers to reach a final consensus on a plan to relocate of 120,000 refugees. “Decisive agreement is needed without further delay to address the needs, as is bold action based on solidarity from all member states,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement. A majority of EU interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, agreed in principle to share out 120,000 asylum seekers on top of some 40,000 distributed on a voluntary basis so far. Hungary’s former Socialist prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany has travelled to the frontier with Serbia to denounce the Hungarian government’s border crackdown. He described the policies of his anti-immigration successor Viktor Orban as “disgraceful”. In an interview with the Canadian broadcaster CTV over the weekend, Gyurcsany said the erection of the border fence was a symbolic gesture by Orban aimed at placating the far-right. “The Hungarian prime minister would like to represent himself as a very strong man trying to gain new voters from the … right,” he said. Britain’s former foreign secretary David Miliband has attacked Hungary’s border crackdown as “shameful and misguided”. Speaking to Channel 4 News, Miliband, now director of the US-based International Rescue Committee, said the construction of a border fence with Serbia would “lock up mountains of problems”. He added: “When you build fences you empower criminal gangs to charge more to get round them.” In the next hour or so German chancellor Angela Merkel is due to make her first statements to the press since her government reintroduced border controls. She is schedule to give a press conference after meeting Austria’s chancellor Werner Faymann. Politico Europe reckons Merkel was forced to partially reverse her government’s welcoming response to refugees after opposition from local governments. The chancellor faced intense pressure from state and local officials expected to house and feed the growing wave of asylum seekers heading to the country. Their message to the German leader: genug, enough. In many cases local governments have proved unable to cope with the large numbers. “The mood is changing, and fast,” said a senior official from Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. At a meeting of the party’s executive committee on Monday, state and local representatives made it clear they were overwhelmed by the masses. “Every mayor likes to be a good German, as long as the refugees are not put into his gym,” the source said. Frontex, the EU’s border agency, has been hit by a drastic shortage of border guards in the Greek islands, on the land border between Greece and Turkey, Bulgaria and Turkey and along the Hungarian border with Serbia, according to a report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Last April, EU heads of state signed off the €26.8m emergency grant at a high-level summit in what was portrayed as Europe uniting in its response to mass tragedies in the Mediterranean. The money was supposed to allow Frontex to lease border guards and equipment from member states who would then be compensated by Frontex with the extra funds ... Frontex officials admitted to the Bureau it “badly need(s) border guards on the Greek islands, border guards and technical equipment on the land border between Greece and Turkey, Bulgaria and Turkey and, crucially along the Hungarian border with Serbia.” Offers of key personnel and equipment from member states “are still very scarce”, said a Frontex spokeswoman. Senior Frontex officials have warned that it may even be forced to hand some of the cash back to the Commission. Frontex’s deputy director Gil Arias-Fernández told the Bureau that having the money was “useless” if it did not have the equipment to spend it on. The Bureau also found that despite more than two million refugees amassing in Turkey and planning their dangerous trips across the borders, Frontex has not had a single member of staff based there gathering intelligence about smugglers. Frontex issued this response: “Each member state has the sufficient capacity to handle border control, but when the migratory pressure becomes exceptionally high, they might require additional assistance of either technical equipment or specialised border guards. The role of Frontex is to coordinate the deployment of such additional assets and human resources from other EU/Schengen Area countries, as described in our founding regulation.” Another migrant boat heading to Greece from Turkey is reported to have sunk, according to AFP. At least 13 migrants including four children trying to reach Greece drowned Tuesday when their boat from Turkey sank in international waters, local media reported. Turkish coastguards rescued 205 migrants from the wooden boat which set off from Turkish holiday resort town of Datca in the southwest for the Greek island of Kos, the private Dogan news agency said. The nationalities of the migrants are not yet known. Rescue efforts were still continuing, according to the news agency. There has been a dramatic spike in the numbers of migrants - mainly from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Africa - seeking to leave Turkey in rickety boats for Greece in the hope of finding new lives in the European Union. At least 34 people, including 15 children, drowned when their overcrowded boat capsized in high winds off a Greek island on Sunday. Human rights observers have been ordered to leave Hungary’s border crossing with Serbia, according to Tirana Hassan, director of crisis response at Amnesty International. Earlier she photographed riot police arriving at the border which she characterised as “Fortress Europe”. The main official border crossing point between Serbia and Hungary was closed to migrants on Tuesday, the UN’s refugee agency has confirmed. At midnight, it shut the crossing near Roszke, leaving hundreds of migrants to queue with no apparent hope of entering. “The border was shut and has yet to re-open,” UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told AFP from the border. “Our staff do not have access, and the Hungarian authorities have not let us know about any schedule they have for re-opening the border,” he added. The first arrests have occurred under Hungary’s new border laws, according to Reuters. Hungarian police detained nine Syrian and seven Afghan migrants early on Tuesday for illegally crossing the Serbian border fence, a police spokeswoman said. Police spokeswoman Viktoria Csiszer-Kovacs said the migrants were suspected of lifting the razor wire fence to get into Hungary, which constitutes a crime under the new laws that took effect at midnight. Under the new system Hungary has designated Serbia as a safe country so if asylum seekers have entered from Serbia without already applying for asylum there – they face automatic expulsion within eight days. Hungarian MEP Gyorgy Schopflin has defended his country’s tough new border laws. He said Hungary could not cope with the “flood” of people arriving. “It is this shock that I think the government is dealing with,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He suggested that the new controls would help calm tension in Hungary. “The more the refugees come in this uncontrolled flood, the more the anti-refugee sentiments arises,” he said. Schopflin, a member of the Fidesz the party founded by Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister Viktor Orban, also rejected the idea of EU quotas for resettling refugees. He said: “We don’t know if we want the commission to impose obligatory quotas. Voluntary is another story.” Schopflin said the “silent majority” of Europeans did not welcome more refugees despite the visible welcome made by many members of the public. And he insisted that it was this public rejection that had forced Germany to reintroduce border controls. Schopflin also claimed that the number refugees arriving was a threat to security and some of Europe’s core values. He said: “If you have a large number of unassimilated recently-arrived migrants, they are potentially capable of destabilising law and order which of course puts the whole of democracy and liberalism in danger.” The border crackdown in Hungary comes a day after the authorities reported a new record number of migrants. The Hungarian police said they intercepted 9,380 people entering Hungary on Monday, a sharp rise the previous record set the day before. Welcome to live coverage of the continuing refugee crisis gripping Europe as laws to criminalise migrants in Hungary come into force. Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Hungary transported thousands of refugees by train dumped them on the border with Austria, ahead of the introduction of a tough new border crackdown, according to the UN’s refugee. Special trains took refugees on a four-hour journey from camps in southern Hungary directly to Austria, the UNHCR said. Frontier-free travel across Europe continues to unravel as countries re-established border controls in the face of the an unprecedented influx of migrants. Germany’s surprise decision to restore border controls on Sunday had a swift domino effect. Slovakia said it would impose controls on its borders with Hungary and Austria. The Netherlands announced it would make spot checks at its borders. Other EU states from Sweden to Poland said they were monitoring the situation to decide whether controls were needed. An emergency meeting of EU interior ministers failed to agree on a new system of binding quotas for refugees being shared across the EU. Instead they agreed to deny the right of asylum to innumerable refugees by funding and building camps for them in Africa and elsewhere outside the EU. The charity named by the UK government as the point of contact for families wishing to volunteer to host Syrian refugees has expressed anger that it was not consulted before Home Office on the plan guidance was published. Naccom, an umbrella group of small organisations that help destitute asylum seekers to find housing, said no one from the government had been in touch before the guidance was published, and stressed that the charity did not have the infrastructure to cope. Berlin’s disused Tempelhof airport is to temporarily house more than a thousand refugees as the search for large-scale emergency accommodation in the German capital grows more frantic. Two hangars at the abandoned airport, famous for its use by the western allies during the Berlin airlift in 1948, have been earmarked to house up to 1,200 refugees."
2015-11-12T13:37:48Z,Sweden introduces border checks as refugee crisis grows,"Sweden is introducing border checks for the first time since the start of the refugee crisis, hours after its prime minister asked European counterparts at a high-level migration conference in Malta to do more to help his country and Germany care for refugees arriving on the continent. Swedish police will monitor trains and ferries arriving from mainland Europe and stop anyone without valid travel documents. Officials stressed that anyone seeking to apply for asylum in Sweden would not be turned back, and said the intention is to deter those hoping to cross Sweden to reach other Scandinavian countries, and to create a more orderly process of arrival for refugees. “If they come to the border and request asylum, then we will process their request, but if they have no desire to stay, then that’s a question for the police,” a spokeswoman for Sweden’s migration agency, Migrationsverket, said. Under the previous system, refugees could simply take the train or ferry to Sweden and enter the country unobstructed – a laissez-faire situation that its prime minister now says constitutes a threat to security. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday, Stefan Löfven said: “If you don’t have good control of who is coming here – what people are actually entering the county – that is a risk.” Sweden is proportionally bearing the biggest burden of the European migration crisis, with 10,000 asylum-seekers arriving every week, and no more short-term space to house them. Migration officials expect the country to absorb at least 170,000 asylum seekers by the end of the year, within a total population of 10 million. Britain, with a population of more than 60 million, has pledged to receive 4,000 Syrian refugees in the same period. Löfven said other EU countries needed to step up their response to the refugee crisis, so that the burden was not only left to Sweden and Germany. “I’ve been mentioning burden sharing for a long time,” Löfven told Today. “It is not sustainable that one country, or two countries, take the vast part of the responsibility. All European countries need to take responsibility. If the European Union can’t handle this situation, it’s serious.” Other European countries have been extremely slow to react to the scale of the crisis. EU leaders have convened several conferences, such as Thursday’s gathering in Malta, but little has been achieved at them. Politicians took months to agree to even a modest quota system that would see less than a quarter of refugee arrivals shared between the EU’s members, leaving the majority of the burden to countries like Sweden and Germany. On Thursday, the deputy head of the EU border agency Frontex said EU countries had failed to provide it with the resources and personnel it needed to deal with the record influx of migrants entering the EU. “Up until now, member states have only committed 40% of the resources we asked for,” Gil Arias told Spanish daily El Mundo. In October the agency turned to the European commission, formally requesting more personnel for operations in Greece and the Balkans, but received little response, he said. The lack of resources, said Arias, has left Frontex in a tricky situation. “Often enormous expectations are generated over what the agency can do,” he said, noting that the agency had unofficially shifted its mandate in recent months from patrolling EU coastlines to carrying out daily rescues of migrants. “Frontex was not created to replace member states when it comes to rescue and border patrol, but rather to help them.” The burden on Sweden has left the country struggling to find enough beds for its new residents, and has led to internal division about its asylum policies. The far-right Swedish Democrat party has called for the country to end its generosity, while the government argues that its high humanitarian standards should be maintained at all costs, and blames its domestic crisis on the negligence of other countries. “The big problem is in Europe,” Fredrik Bengtsson, spokesman for Migrationsverket, said. “There are so many different asylum systems. In Sweden we have one system, in Hungary they have another, so of course [refugees] are making the rational decision about where they want to go. “The key for this question is not for Sweden to lower their standards, it’s for other people to raise theirs.”"
2015-12-06T18:01:01Z,Greece to set up island screening centres to ease refugee crisis,"Greece has enacted emergency legislation to facilitate the registration of the large number of refugees entering the country days after seeking help to reinforce its borders from the EU. Deflecting withering criticism that it has not done enough to deal with the crisis, the government unveiled plans to establish five hotspots, or screening centres, on outlying Aegean islands where some 660,000 migrants and refugees have arrived this year. The law, published in the government gazette early on Saturday, took many by surprise. Local authorities on islands such as Kos have long claimed the establishment of such centres will only attract more refugees. In a strongly worded statement, the Kos branch of the main opposition conservative New Democracy party said the decision would lead with “mathematical precision” to the destruction of the island’s tourist industry. Greece was reportedly threatened with suspension from the passport-free Schengen zone last week following mounting EU dissatisfaction with its inability to control its borders and its management of migrant reception centres. In a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the bloc’s health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said he had been appalled by conditions on Lesbos, where the lack of emergency care was such that babies were dying of hypothermia. The threat caught Athens’ leftist-led government off-guard but also appears to have goaded it into action: Saturday’s surprise move came less than 24 hours after European interior ministers met to discuss the measures now needed to improve the flow of refugees from Greece to the EU. The northern frontier the country shares with Macedonia has been the site of chaotic scenes since the former Yugoslav republic began erecting a fence and blocking entrance to anyone not deemed to be a migrant from a conflict zone. “The possibility of being kicked out of Schengen set off alarm bells,” said one well-placed insider. “With the country’s economic crisis it would have sent a terrible signal to investors.” Extra guards from Europe’s border agency, Frontex, and emergency supplies are expected to arrive in Greece this week. Under EU legislation usually enacted to cope with natural disasters, officials said tents, generators and other equipment would be flown in to help Greece accommodate people over the winter. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ coalition, in power with the small rightwing Independent Greeks party, denied it had previously rejected the offer of the assistance. Despite Turkey’s promise to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Greece following a landmark agreement between Ankara and the EU last week, busloads of new arrivals continued on Sunday to make their way to the Macedonian frontier. “Tensions have eased a bit but they are still coming,” Alexandros Voulgaris, an official with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, based in Idomeni said. “Only today 1,500 arrived here. They all want to continue their journey [through the Balkans] into Europe.”"
2015-08-26T18:52:44Z,Settling on credible solutions to the European Union’s refugee crisis | Letters,"Like many others, we have been disappointed and ashamed at the inability of the UK and other EU governments to produce any convincing proposals to deal with the “migrant crisis” (Razor wire and prison: the wrong response to the refugee crisis, Editorial, 26 August). Instead of strengthening fences and blaming others, we could learn from the response to the massive refugee flows after the 1914-18 and 1939-45 world wars: “Nansen passports” for the displaced and temporary camps throughout Europe and the Middle East. Some positive proposals: 1) The most obvious short-term measure now required is a Europe-wide agreement to resettle in northern countries more of the refugees arriving in Greece and Italy. 2) The UN high commissioner for refugees could coordinate a network of temporary camps in countries to accommodate those now entering Europe in flight. 3) Refugees and migrants who are seeking to join relatives already established here or in other Europeans states should be allowed to do so. 4) The Disasters Emergency Committee could launch an appeal for immediate funding to assist these proposals. 5) We should expand upon the German initiative regarding Syrian asylum seekers by allowing refugees to be assessed where they are, and before allocation to countries. 6) The EU and the UN could coordinate relevant international and NGO agencies to deliver these purposes. 7) We should discuss the challenge presented by this “crisis” to the self-image of British and European society as civilised, tolerant and universally respectful of human dignity. Tom Hadden Queen’s University Belfast and University of Kent John Fitzpatrick University of Kent • Thousands of refugees are pouring into Greece and Italy every day, desperate to escape from war-torn countries, terrorism and atrocities unimaginable by most of us. I am in no doubt that this will continue in the long term, and it is indeed one of Europe’s biggest challenges. During the second world war my grandmother took in a child evacuated from Holland, fleeing from persecution. Countries and communities worked together to come up with solutions. My grandmother didn’t hesitate to accommodate the child. She didn’t question how she would manage. Like many people in her community, they pulled together and not only helped each other but also people from other countries. They did the right thing. I absolutely agree with Natalie Nougayrède (Merkel is right: the migration crisis will define this decade, 21 August) that each of us must look closely at ourselves, and remember our collective past. We as individuals have a moral obligation to urge our leaders to do the right thing and save people in need, for this will be Angela Merkel’s bigger challenge. How do you rally Europe’s leaders when I suspect there will be so much opposition at home? Maria Powell Wimborne, Dorset • You are right to highlight, in your 26 August editorial, the different attitude of Britain to migrants, which is in sharp contrast to Germany. I was on holiday in Germany recently and the local newspaper in Lübeck where I was staying reported that they were planning to accept around 3,000 migrants in the next year, in a town of around 200,000 people. There was none of the prejudice found in much of the British press, just acceptance that it was part of the town’s civic duty to share in helping with a European-wide problem. It is sad that Britain, which once welcomed refugees from Nazi Germany, is now outdone by that country in its tolerance to people seeking asylum. Ian Arnott Peterborough • Your editorial (One regime’s brutality and the roots of Europe’s migrant crisis, 20 August) has provided an incisive and timely reminder of the despotism led by President Afwerki of Eritrea. His reign of terror was categorised by July’s UN commission report as likely to constitute “crimes against humanity”. It has led thousands of desperate Eritreans to risk their very existence to seek a better life elsewhere. According to UNHCR, while 60,000 Syrians crossed the Mediterranean between January and October 2014, 35,000 people from the much smaller state of Eritrea made the same perilous voyage – and Eritrea is not racked by war. UN sanctions have been imposed on Eritrea, which is often described as Africa’s North Korea. The analysis that Eritreans are being trapped into what amounts to enslavement by a cruel and oppressive regime deserves to be supported by all who understand that concession to such forces is surely wrong in principle and fails to influence in practice. If supporters of Afwerki object to the narrative provided by the Guardian, the UN, and others who have to rely on the testimony of those escaping the country, the remedy is in their own hands: the rulers should open Eritrea, end reporting controls, release the countless political prisoners, and make the liberation they won – and many of us actively supported – meaningful, instead of the travesty that it is now. Glenys Kinnock Labour, House of Lords • Is it not an irony (Analysis, 25 August) that 26 years after the rest of Europe looked on and hailed as champions of liberty those seeking a better life as they scrambled in their thousands through the Hungarian border fences, the razor wire goes up once again, unashamedly to halt the flow in the other direction. Clearly the world is divided into the “right” and the “wrong” sort of refugee. Paul Roper High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire • Your correspondents are right to point out that western interventions abroad have usually had deplorable results (Letters, 22 August). However, it is important that the root cause of the refugee crisis in north Africa, and south-east Asia, is not overlooked: global warming. Rising sea levels have devastated Bangladeshi rice fields, bringing mass starvation. The accelerating desertification of the Saharan region (now estimated to cover a third of Africa) is having the same effect. Crop failures lead to hunger, and then to migration, overcrowding, poverty and desperation – breeding grounds for conflict and extremism. If global warming continues, the scenes we see now will be repeated round all the populated world. If this isn’t a call to action, what on earth is? Fay Marshall Brighton • Alongside the so-called migrant crisis across the European Union is an evolving moral disaster. Repeated migrant boating tragedies, where hundreds of lives are lost with each capsize, and the escalating desperation in Calais have been greeted with a noticeable decrease in solidarity and empathy from EU policy leaders and citizens. It seems we are increasingly having to justify what should be a given: a refusal to abandon the most vulnerable. We must all recognise that every individual migrant is part of a worldwide narrative of conflict, disasters and threats of persecution that have made their homes uninhabitable. Many of our fellow citizens have found themselves in similar situations in the past and more recently. Our consciences should be disturbed further by how most refugees are accommodated, not by the EU, but by lower-income countries. This reflects the sad moral state of our European Union. The EU has, of course, finite resources, but this suffering offers opportunities for us to shape the world into a better home for all humanity. To avert the unfolding moral and humanitarian disaster we must acknowledge and act upon our obligation to provide humanitarian assistance that ensures shelter, safety and dignity for each refugee.

2015-12-10T16:37:30Z,Turkish crackdown leaves refugees in limbo,"Wet clothes are spread out on bushes and stones. Some people have lit fires. The torn heap of a grey rubber boat lies folded up on the coast. Outside the abandoned concrete shells of a holiday village originally built for German tourists in the 1980s, Yasin and his friends nervously await the arrival of their smuggler. Here, near the upmarket Turkish coastal town of Çeşme, hundreds of refugees brave the icy winds of early December to make their way to the Greek island of Chios, less than two miles off the Turkish coast. “We tried to cross this morning, but the boat hit some rocks and was torn,” said Yasin, 28, a Kurd from Iran who claims he had to leave his country for political reasons. All 45 passengers managed to get back safely to the Turkish shore, but most of them threw all their belongings overboard when the dinghy took in water. The smuggler, an Afghan, has promised to come back with a new boat. Some of Yasin’s friends worry about possible arrest, or that he will not turn up as promised. Recent police crackdowns on refugees leave many in fear of getting stuck in Turkey. In what is thought to be the largest such mass arrest of refugees in recent months, almost 3,000 future asylum seekers, mainly from Syria and Iraq, were picked up at the start of this month by Turkish police from the north-western town of Ayvacık, from where many leave for the Greek island of Lesbos. Police told local media that 35 suspected smugglers had also been detained, and hundreds of rubber dinghies seized. The crackdown followed a highly controversial deal struck at a summit in Brussels, under which the EU pledged €3bn (£2.2bn) and political concessions to Turkey in exchange for increased border patrols. But while the Ayvacık sweeps suggest a clampdown on trafficking and irregular border crossings, refugees wanting to leave Turkey to claim asylum in Europe find themselves stuck in an increasingly hopeless limbo. Turkish authorities say all the Syrian refugees detained last week have since been released, while others remain in detention in overcrowded, so-called return centres, facing deportation to their home countries, where they are often at risk of serious human rights abuses. Groups such as Amnesty International have warned that such expulsions violated the “non-refoulement” principle of international law, which bans countries from returning refugees to conflict zones where their lives may be in danger. Local security forces are often overstretched. In Çeşme alone, 55 miles (90km) of ragged coastline make it hard to police the hidden bays and beaches. At an evening checkpoint, a senior police officer expresses his frustration at the lack of capacity for dealing with the refugee crisis. “We don’t know where to put them. We want them to leave [to Greece]. There are hundreds of them here. We are unable to deal with such numbers in a meaningful manner,” he says. “And those we get off the beach always come back.” A local journalist who wished to remain anonymous said police often turned a blind eye to the refugees who arrive in Çeşme. “Everyone knows they are there, and where they are going. Sometimes they round them up, but they then have to let them go again. Until they actually leave Turkey illegally, they have not committed any offence,” the journalist said. “And both the police and the coastguard lack the proper facilities to process hundreds of people. Both they and the refugees are left in a very difficult situation.” Last week security forces supported by police officers from Izmir detained more than 150 refugees. Several traffickers were arrested. But most of those picked up by the police were released several hours later. Some were put in taxis with orders to drive them back to Izmir. “The taxi driver had a good heart and only drove us to the bus station [in Çeşme], and from there we walked back here,” says Mohammed Nour, 35, an Afghan national who worked as a translator for German troops in a Nato base in Kunduz for over five years. “There is nothing for us in Turkey. I cannot find work. Back home I received continuous death threats for my work with the Germans. We have used all our money to get here.” Turkey, a country that hosts about 2.2 million Syrian refugees, the largest such population in the world, bars most asylum seekers and migrants from working. According to a recent report by the Turkish Confederation of Employer Associations (TISK), 400,000 Syrians, more than half of them children, are working illegally in Turkey, mostly without insurance and for salaries below the already meagre minimum wage. Occasional sweeps of the beaches will not deliver a sustainable solution, says Ali Güray Yalvaçlı, head of the Imece Initiative Çeşme, a group of volunteers who supply food, clothes and other necessities to the refugees stuck outside the town. “If the Germans and other Europeans want refugees to stay here, why don’t they open a few factories here, so that people can make a living and have a future here? Nobody wants to live in a camp, idly, without a future.” But such solutions are lacking. Instead, the district governor has asked the Çeşme bus company not to take refugees on board, and taxi drivers are banned from driving them to the relevant drop-off points, under threat of having their licence revoked for 60 days. Local activists warn that such bans will only prompt smugglers and refugees to choose other, more dangerous ways, to reach the coast. “If something is banned from being done in the open, it will go to the black markets. Whereas people could pay 10 [Turkish] lira to get on a public bus before, they will now have to pay 100 lira to travel in the back of a smugglers’ lorry. It will not stop people who are desperate trying to get away,” Yalvaçlı said. Ali, 28, a lecturer of English from Idlib, says he and at least 20 others were stacked “like fish” in a closed van on their way from Izmir to Çeşme. From there he made his way to Chios. A second dinghy capsized that night, drowning at least three people. The perilous crossing was his third attempt to leave Turkey after having been arrested while trying to go to Lesbos and being illegally deported back to Turkey by Greek police at the land border with Edirne. Ali worked in five different jobs in Turkey over the course of a year. He applied to countless schools, to no avail. “I like Turkey, but life there is difficult. It’s a life without a future, without even an identity for us Syrians. Sometimes I woke up at night and had to remind myself who I am,” he said. “Sometimes I call the traffickers my heroes. They saved my life. It is only because of them that I am here, not because of the EU or the UN.” Now he sits in a bus station among hundreds of other refugees waiting for the ferry that will take them from Chios to Athens. Senior local Greek police sources say they have not recorded any change in the numbers of arrivals after the agreement between Turkey and the EU was struck in Brussels. In a way, Ali was lucky. For many others the random crackdowns by Turkish security forces mean they are stuck in limbo. “They took our boat twice,” said Mushtaq, 27, who served two years in the Afghan army before death threats by the Taliban forced him to flee. Now he is stuck in the holiday village in Çiftlik. “I have no money left. The police took our boats twice, but didn’t arrest us, didn’t give us food. They also told us we could not make a fire on the beach.” Fear of Turkey shutting its borders once and for all, as requested by the EU, has prompted many, including Ali, to bring forward their journey despite a significant drop in temperature and dangerously rough seas. According to the UN high commissioner for refugees, 30,451 asylum seekers made their way from Turkey to Greece at the beginning of December, 15 times as many as in all of December last year. Of at least 31 people who drowned in the Aegean this week alone, 11 were children. Local activists are outraged at the EU deal, and many worry Turkey will use the money provided by the EU for security and more detention centres. “Europe outsourced its border security to Turkey,” said Eda Bekçi, a lawyer who volunteers at the refugee aid group Mülteci-Der in Izmir. “But heightened security will push people-smuggling only deeper underground. They will always find holes, but the routes will become riskier and deadlier for refugees.”"
2015-12-10T11:12:52Z,"Migration is not worth the risk, says Syrian man whose family drowned","A Syrian man whose wife and seven children drowned as they attempted to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to mainland Europe has warned other refugees that the risks of migration are not worth taking. Ali Alsaho and his family had been fleeing Islamic State militants in Deir el-Zour, eastern Syria, when the engine of the boat they were travelling on failed near the coastal town of Çeşme in western Turkey last month. Alsaho was the only member of the family to survive. His wife and children, who were aged between nine and 20 days old, all drowned. Speaking through tears, Alsaho told the BBC that smugglers had told his family they would not need life jackets because the boat was safe. “I had the most affectionate wife. I took my family out of Syria to escape the killing. My children could have had a future in Europe. Now I have lost my family, my world,” he said. Asked what advice he had for other refugees considering the perilous journey to Europe, Alsaho said: “I would say don’t take this risk. Don’t go by sea. You will lose your children. The smugglers are traitors. They said we would reach Greece within 15 minutes. I advise everyone: don’t come, stay in Syria, however difficult it is.” The bodies of some of Alsaho’s children, as well as his wife, have not yet been recovered. Their tragic story is not uncommon – this week, another group of migrants, including six Afghan children, drowned after a rubber dinghy carrying them to Greece sank in the Aegean. They are among more than 3,500 people who have died or been reported missing this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. Turkey is under international pressure to help stem the flow of migrants. Ankara has stepped up a crackdown on people smuggling, arresting thousands of refugees, after it promised to curb the flow of refugees to Greece in exchange for financial aid from the EU. The EU’s pledge of €3bn (£2.1bn) in aid for the 2.2 million Syrians now in Turkey is intended to raise living standards and persuade migrants to stay in the country rather than attempt the journey to the EU via the Greek islands. “As Turkey is making an effort to take in refugees – who will not come to Europe – it’s reasonable that Turkey receive help from Europe to accommodate those refugees,” the French president, François Hollande, said at the time. As part of the deal, Ankara was also offered a “re-energised” negotiating process on Turkish membership of the EU, as well as visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen zone for Turkish nationals. David Cameron said: “We need a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis in Europe and obviously that involves Turkey.” Meanwhile, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, recently told the Guardian that refugees arriving in Europe should be detained for up to 18 months in holding centres across the EU while they are screened for security and terrorism risks. Hollande has said a deal with Turkey should make it easier to check migrants arriving and keep out those who pose a threat."
2015-11-05T11:45:48Z,Comedians stand up for refugees,"What do comedians do when they see heart-breaking images of children drowning trying to reach Europe? They put on a stand-up show of course. Greg Davies, UK sitcom and panel-show lynchpin, gives the one-liners a pause while explaining why he was inspired to get a group together of his most famous comedian friends to raise money for refugees. “It was as simple as seeing the news coverage of refugees fleeing war-torn areas,” says Davies, who has starred in The Inbetweeners and Man Down. “What else can you do as a comedian but do some comedy to raise money to help?” The benefit includes some of comedy’s biggest names - Jo Brand, Roisin Conaty, Russell Howard, Reginald D Hunter, Dara O’Briain and Jack Whitehall – and is raising money for ActionAid and UNHCR. “The UN and agencies like ActionAid are incredibly stretched,” says Davies, adding that he hasn’t “got a clue” how to solve the crisis. “I think you have to hand that over to professionals who know what they’re talking about. We’re just trying to raise a little bit of extra money for basic provisions for all of these thousands of people.” Davies put the gig together with children’s TV presenter Ed Petrie, who saw the extent of the migrant crisis for himself in Serbia. “Seeing something like this up close, all these people in their jeans, T-shirts and trainers JUST LIKE ME, but living my worst nightmare – meant that once I got home I was bending the ear of anyone who would listen,” Petrie says. The team thinks now is the right time for a gig, as the weather turns colder and crossing the Mediterranean becomes more perilous. The public outcry, donation drives and grassroots fundraising in reaction to the crisis has impressed Davies. “It restores your faith in human nature when you see the response from the British public,” he says. “The negativity that you receive on social media when you announce you’re doing something like this is minimal, and clearly from people who are not thinking straight. The vast majority of people are delighted to support something like this. It’s heartwarming.” The comedian is aware that raising several thousand pounds at a comedy gig is “a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed”, but hopes the show will be the beginning of something bigger. “All of us who are involved in this are aware that it’s a very meagre offering, but it’s something. And I hope we’ll go on to do other things. It feels like the start of something rather than a one-off.” Greg Davies, Jo Brand, Roisin Conaty, Russell Howard, Reginald D Hunter, Dara O’Briain and Jack Whitehall are performing at Stand up for Action at the Hammersmith Apollo on Wednesday 11 November.

2015-12-09T16:38:56Z,"Greece buses 2,000 refugees from border camp to Athens","Greece has dispersed more than 2,000 refugees who were stuck for weeks in a camp near the Macedonian border, as the EU announced that over 1 million people had now claimed asylum within its borders since the start of the year. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continue to be allowed into Macedonia and the Balkans, but people of other nationalities, who make up roughly 10% of the total number, have been stopped at the border since early November. Instead of returning to Athens, many of them set up camp for several weeks – and several sewed shut their mouths – leading to Wednesday’s dispersal. In separate developments, the EU said it had received at least 1 million asylum seekers in 2015, a figure that includes refugees who have crossed the Mediterranean as well as internal European migrants from Kosovo and Albania. It does not include numbers from the latest surge in maritime arrivals; on Wednesday 11 people were confirmed to have drowned in the Atlantic Ocean during an attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands by boat from west Africa. In northern Greece, an activist and an aid worker said hundreds of Greek police arrived in the morning to disperse the camp, which includes asylum seekers from warring countries such as Somalia, as well as peaceful ones like Morocco. The vast majority went without protest, though some Iranians held a short demonstration at around midday, before being bussed back to Athens in a convoy of around 50 coaches. “We haven’t seen any violence and we haven’t treated anybody for violence,” said Constance Theisen, a representative of Médecins Sans Frontières, which has been working in the area since the spring. Aid workers are now preparing for chaotic scenes in Athens, where the rejected asylum seekers were due to spend the night in two stadiums, and where officials and campaigners have not decided on a joint strategy. “At the moment, you have IOM [the International Organisation for Migration] promoting voluntary returns [to their home countries],” said Theisen. “And you have UNHCR [the UN refugee agency] telling people how to apply for asylum.” Other observers speculate that those who have been returned to Athens will not remain for long, with many expected to try to reach northern Europe via Bulgaria or Albania instead. “Let’s wait for the new route, because we will see it soon,” said Vasilis Tsartsanis, an activist who has been working on the Macedonian border for more than a year. “They will go again to the mafia and the smugglers.” Meanwhile, the bodies of 11 migrants attempting to reach Spain’s Canary Islands by boat were recovered on Tuesday, the latest victims of a perilous migration route that appears to be regaining popularity with sub-Saharan migrants desperate to make it to Europe. The 11 were believed to be on a small boat packed with 39 people that set off from Western Sahara two days earlier, in the hope of making it across the treacherous stretch of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the Canary Islands from west Africa. Moroccan authorities said the boat capsized after it ran into poor weather conditions. There were no reports on the whereabouts of the others on the boat. It was the third boat attempting the crossing in as many days. On Sunday, the Spanish coastguard rescued 51 people making the journey, and on Monday another 47 people. The crossings represent a small revival in attempts to reach one of Europe’s southernmost outposts. Rough estimates suggest that more than 400 people have arrived in the Spanish archipelago since the start of the year, up from 296 in 2014 – the highest annual total since 2009. Some 270 migrants and refugees arrived in September and October alone. The numbers arriving on the islands nevertheless remain a far cry far from those in 2006, when more than 31,000 migrants arrived in the Canary Islands. Hundreds of others drowned or died of thirst and exposure while attempting the journey, which can take up to two weeks. At the time, Spanish authorities responded to the surge by increasing coastguard patrols and signing repatriation agreements with several African countries. The number of migrants dropped substantially, to as low as 196 in 2013, according to Spain’s interior ministry. Many migrants instead tried their luck on the triple razor-wire fence that lines the borders of the Spanish enclave of Melilla, which more than 2,000 migrants and refugees managed to scale in 2014. In response, Spanish authorities added a fine layer of mesh to make it tougher to climb and passed a controversial law allowing border guards to forcibly return anyone who makes it over the fence to Morocco. The number of migrants making across the fence this year has since dropped to around 100 people."
2015-12-03T16:55:33Z,Pakistan sends deported migrants back to Greece,"Thirty-one migrants made a round trip from Greece to Pakistan on Thursday after the government in Islamabad said the EU had illegally deported them. Although 19 out of the 50 deportees who came in on a charter plane were taken into custody in Pakistan, the remainder stayed on board for almost two hours before returning to Greece after the government said they did not have the correct paperwork. It was the latest salvo in a row between the EU and Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the Pakistani interior minister angry about the treatment of his compatriots by European states struggling with a migrant crisis. “Pakistani laws have been violated, which absolutely cannot be allowed,” Khan said in a statement. The issue has been a running source of tension with the EU. In early November Khan suspended an agreement on readmitting illegal detainees, saying two EU states were sending Pakistanis home on “baseless terrorism charges”. “Those who give lectures on fundamental rights to us should also respect fundamental rights of Pakistanis,” he said at the time. Last week Dimitris Avramopoulos, a Greek politician and the EU commissioner responsible for migration policy, visited Pakistan to try to soothe concerns. But on Thursday Pakistan said the EU was still not honouring pledges to only return those whose identity had been confirmed, saying the men flown back to Greece were “unverified deportees”. The EU office in Islamabad said all 50 people on the flight organised by Frontex, the agency in charge of Europe’s borders, had been given passports to travel by the Pakistani embassies in Greece, Bulgaria and Austria. It said Pakistan’s demand that the migrants should also have their national identity card numbers was impossible for EU officials to organise and that it was not part of the agreement struck with Pakistan. “The list of names [of the deportees] had been sent to the Pakistani authorities earlier, providing sufficient time to the relevant Pakistani authorities to find the missing numbers for the returnees,” the EU said. Last year, about 21,000 Pakistanis who were in Europe without permission were ordered to return home. An estimated 50,000 Pakistanis travel legally to Europe for work each year. Clashes erupted on the Greek-Macedonian border on Tuesday when Macedonian police fired teargas to repel hundreds of mostly Pakistani migrants trying to push through a new border fence. Some of them later blocked the crossing for Syrians and others who would have been let in as war refugees. “If we don’t cross, no one does!” they chanted."
2015-09-06T14:41:09Z,Refugee crisis: thousands arrive in Germany amid calls for action in Syria - as it happened,"Writer Patrick Ness says Philip Pullman, author of His Dark Materials trilogy, has pledged £10,000 to his fundraising campaign for refugees. Here’s a round up of the main events on Sunday as the migration crisis continues to unfold: A fundamental review of Britain’s £9bn aid budget will be used to fund Syrian refugees for their first year in the UK and to support Syria’s neighbours hosting camps, George Osborne has said. Germany is not asking how many refugees it can afford to shelter, but how it can make the new arrivals feel safe at last, the mayor of Munich said as the city prepared to register thousands of people on Sunday. Volunteers and donors for refugees condemned government’s response at charity event in east London. Nicola Sturgeon and Yvette Cooper have indicated that they would be prepared to house Syrian refugees as the Scottish government and Labour party intensified pressure on David Cameron to act generously. The chancellor, George Osborne, announced that the government would use funds from the UK’s £12bn annual overseas aid budget to help local authorities cover the costs of housing refugees. Guardian reporter provides this analysis of how the UK will pay for refugees the government has pledged to take. David Cameron is facing growing pressure to extend RAF air strikes into Syria as the worsening conflict threatened to drive increasing numbers of desperate refugees to seek sanctuary in Europe. The former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey became the latest senior figure to call for a renewed military effort to “crush” Islamic State in its Syrian heartlands. The situation has become increasingly explosive on Lesvos, Greece, one of the islands on the frontline of the crisis, as running battles escalate between riot police and refugees desperate to board boats for Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Greece’s migration minister Ioannis Mouzalas has rushed to Lesvos after a second day of street fighting on the Aegean isle. Scenes of stone-pelting refugees engaged in hand-to-hand battle with local police has prompted the government to step up security with two extra units of riot police being dispatched to the island earlier today. Amid renewed violence local officials processing newcomers this morning locked themselves in a container as refugees, once again, vented their anger over delays in registration. On Saturday police resorted to using tear gas and stun grenades as around 500 Afghans attempted to seize and board a ferry heading to Athens. At least four were injured, one seriously. With an estimated 13,000 migrants and refugees on the island – and hundreds arriving every day – the local mayor, Spyros Galanos, described the situation as being “out of control.” “There is a danger that a spark could trigger a big fire,” he said in a television interview adding that “a state of emergency” should be called on the island. “I have tabled proposals, I even called on mayors in Turkey and Europe and tabled proposals, but no one is listening.” Galanos said he hoped the migration minister’s visit – which coincided with Athens’ caretaker government also sending in extra coast guard officials and other experts to expedite the processing of refugees - would de-escalate tensions. “We are expecting some commitments [from the government] so that we will see how we can handle the situation,” he told the news portal, newsit.gr. Racheting up the pressure, the mayor took the unprecedented step of urging islanders to boycott upcoming general elections on 20 September. He said local authorities would refuse to set up ballot boxes at polling stations “if measures aren’t taken immediately to defuse the situation.” The country, facing its worst economic crisis in modern times, has announced it needs more than 1 billion euros to deal with the refugee crisis. In a good-will gesture Germany said over the weekend it would double humanitarian aid destined for Greece, dispatching an extra 2.4 million euros’ worth of relief through the Red Cross and UN agency for refugees, the UNHCR. Germany is not asking how many people it can afford to shelter, but how it can make thousands of refugees feel safe at last, the mayor of Munich said as the town prepared to register thousands of new arrivals on Sunday, Emma Graham-Harrison reports. The city expects to receive around 10,000 people over this one weekend alone. The new arrivals were greeted by cheering crowds handing out toys and chocolate as they filed off trains and into tents for basic medical checks. They are then bussed away to conference centres, school halls and other large spaces that have been pressed into service as temporary housing centres, part of a complex system for handling the flood of migrants that was set up almost overnight. Mayor Dieter Reiter said his own city had surprised him by how effectively it had responded to the crisis, and was “Of course there are some limits responding given the space we have in Munich but that is not the question I am asking myself,” Reiter told journalists after a news conference. “Every day I am asking myself how can we accommodate these people, these refugees, how can we give them a feeling that they are safe here in Munich, here in Germany. I am not really thinking about how many people can we afford and can we take here in Munich. That is not the question.” On Saturday 6,780 people arrived in Munich on trains, many of them from the large group that had set off to walk from Budapest to Austria after days stranded at a train station in the Hungarian capital. After a long day’s march, most were picked up by busses and taken to the border, but many arrived exhausted and sick. Perhaps the most critical new arrival was a baby born prematurely on the concourse at Keleti station, on Tuesday,” said Stephanie Jacobs, health minister in the local government. She arrived with her umbilical cord still attached, and needed urgent medical care. “She is now in an incubator, and doing well given the circumstances,” Jacobs said. The city is expecting another 4,000 to arrive on Sunday. The first 1,200 came in the early hours of the morning, but their trains were diverted straight away to other German cities, including Frankfurt, to ease the pressure on Munich. Men, women and children who have recently crossed the border into Hungary from Serbia are escorted to a new transit camp near the town of Röszke on Sunday. Regional newspapers and websites are reporting on the activities and actions of people supporting refugees across the country. A demonstration against the Government’s stance on refugees in Oxford is expected to attract more than 1,500 people, the Oxford Mail reports. The Refugees Welcome protest outside the Sheldonian Theatre from 3pm will see Oxford residents call on the Government take greater humanitarian responsibility for the crisis. A similar event took place in Cambridge on Saturday as hundreds took to the streets to offer support, the Cambridge News says. An estimated 300 people joined the demo on Market Square, which started at King’s Parade and marched up to the steps of the Guildhall. In Cornwall, the Cornish Guardian reports that the Bishop of Truro has added his voice to calls for Britain to do more to help people fleeing war-torn Syria. The Rt Rev Tim Thornton said he thought Britain had been “caught on the back foot” but that public opinion was now leading policy development, after Prime Minister David Cameron promised the UK would take “thousands” of refugees. The Shropshire Star has a story about a mother who, moved by the harrowing photo of dead toddler Aylun Kurdi being pulled from the surf in Turkey, launched an appeal to buy life jackets for refugees. Joanna Seabright, from Radbrook Green, Shrewsbury, set up a crowd-funding page and hopes to raise thousands of pounds to buy life jackets for those who are making the dangerous journey. Musician and campaigner Bob Geldof pledges to accept four refugee families into his Kent and London homes ‘until they can get a purchase on the future’. Chief political correspondent Nicholas Watt has looked at suggestions Nicola Sturgeon and Yvette Cooper have indicated that they would be prepared to house Syrian refugees. He writes: Sturgeon told the Murnaghan Programme on Sky News that she would be “absolutely happy” to take a refugee from Syria. This raised the prospect that a refugee could be housed in Bute House, the 18th-century Edinburgh townhouse that serves as the official residence of the Scottish first minister. Cooper also told Sky News she and her husband, Ed Balls, would be prepared to accept a refugee. Guardian reporter Sam Jones has taken a look at how the UK will pay for refugees government it has pledged to take. More than 2,000 people have offered to house refugees in their own homes as ordinary Britons lead the way in responding to the refugee crisis, the Press Association reports. Zoe Fritz, who has set up an online database of people willing to give a bed to those fleeing conflict and persecution, said she has been moved to tears by the flood of responses. Dr Fritz, 39, who works as a consultant at Cambridge University Hospital, said she set up the initiative after seeing shocking images of the wave of refugees risking their lives to come to Europe. My heart has sung at the things people have written. It has been extraordinary the generosity people have had. From people who clearly have the space to people who have said ‘I don’t have much but I have more than a tent on a beach somewhere’. The chair of the European Parliament lead committee on migration and refugees in Europe, Claude Moraes MEP, says it is highly unlikely refugees will be able to come to Britain within a reasonable time scale. Moraes, the Labour MEP for London and former director of the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants, says schemes for allowing Syrians into the UK have the “highest level of bureaucracy and proven long time scales”. It is likely that the UK in choosing to opt for UN ‘gateway style schemes’ and increased aid directly to refugee camps is signalling a critical move away from coordinated EU action. This is a significant blow to the EU’s ability to significantly upgrade and manage a credible policy in the coming week which will not only manage the crisis currently within Europe, and on Europe’s borders, but also anticipating the high numbers who will continue coming to the EU over the coming months. It is a misunderstanding of the nature of asylum to believe that cherry picking a modest number of asylum seekers from refugee camps while opting out of coordinated actions will help the long term solution to the refugee crisis. Our migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley continues to provide unique insight into the picture at the Hungary-Serbia border. People said they came “just to help” fill the gap between the refugee crisis and government inaction as donations of blankets, boots, food and tents piled up on a street in east London. More than 100 volunteers turned up to form a human chain to sort and collate goods dropped into a warehouse in Kingsland Road, Hackney following an appeal by grassroots refugee charity CalAid. Asked why she came along, school administrator Elsie Inglis said: “Because I’m disgusted by the government’s behaviour.” Hilary Waterfield who arrived just after 11am with £400 worth of boots, socks and walking boots said: “I couldn’t repeat what I have been thinking about the Tories. I just can’t believe the Tories these past few days, but in a way it’s been wonderful too because of the response of the people to the crisis.” Similar collections have been taking place all over the country, but CalAid organiser James Fisher warned the British public not to drive to Calais following disturbances on Saturday and Friday when Belgian aid trucks showed up at the camps. “We want to channel everything through a system. What is not needed in Calais we will get to places like Kos,” he said. “We have been here since 8am and the most extraordinary sight is the human chain from the street up to here. It is like a well-oiled machine and these people met each other two hours ago,” said Fisher. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison is at a press conference in Munich on the impact of the refugee crisis. Hundreds of people make the long walk from Budapest in Hungary to the Austrian border on Saturday, flanked by local police and chanting ‘we want buses’. Pope Francis is asking faithful throughout Europe to shelter refugees fleeing “death from war and hunger.” Francis said that the Vatican’s two parishes are taking in two families of refugees. He gave no details as he addressed tens of thousands of people in St Peter’s Square. He said it’s not enough to say “have courage, hang in there” to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who are on the march toward what he called “life’s hope.” He called on every Catholic parish, convent, monastery and sanctuary in Europe to shelter a family, and asked bishops throughout Europe to urge their dioceses to do the same. One Direction performer Harry Styles has thrown his support behind the Save the Children refugee appeal. You might not be a fan, but the influence these boy-banders have shouldn’t be underestimated. Harry Styles alone has 25.5 million Twitter followers and the group’s legions of fans listen keenly to what they have to say. Last month, bankers at Credit Suisse warned that Styles had sparked a surge in negative sentiment towards SeaWorld, the controversial aquatic theme park, after urging fans on stage to boycott the attraction. A fund-raising campaign set up by children’s writer Patrick Ness to help with the Syrian refugee crisis has reached nearly £500,000 in just three days. Ness launched the fundraiser on Thursday, explaining he had to do “something to help this refugee crisis” and pledging to match the first £10,000 in donations to a personal appeal for the charity Save the Children. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott says his government is prepared to accept more refugees amid the ongoing migrant crisis in Europe. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison is at Munich station in Germany where hundreds of refugees are arriving. She files this report: The parkers live in a rural area about 45 minutes on a train from Munich, that has seen an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity. Around 80 people have been put up temporarily in a school gym in the village next to theirs. “There is huge solidarity, there are helper groups in every village trying to help them settle in and deal with processes. Germany is very bureaucratic, there are a lot of forms to fill in,” said mother Jane Parker, a Brit who has lived in the area for nearly 20 years. “It’s a privilege to help people fleeing a war. We live in a very rich part of Europe.” The family have come to hand out some of their toys to refugee children arriving on the trains. Jane is a language teacher and is also thinking of volunteering to help new arrivals learn German. Here daughter Annabel is spending her 16th birthday in the station. “I saw the reports on the news and wanted to help,” she said. There are a range of powerful images pouring into the Guardian picture desk from across Europe. Here is just a small selection of the photos we’re seeing. Our chief political correspondent, Nicholas Watt, has filed his take on George Osborne’s appearance on the Andrew Marr show. He writes: A fundamental review of Britain’s £9bn aid budget will be used to fund Syrian refugees for their first year in the UK and to support Syria’s neighbours hosting camps, George Osborne has said. As David Cameron prepares to brief MPs on Monday on the government’s plans to admit thousands of extra refugees, the chancellor said the UK would focus on admitting Syrian orphans. He declined to say how many refugees the government would take, after the Sunday Times reported the figure could be as high as 15,000. He indicated, however, that the government is minded to take several thousand and may even come close to the EU demand of 18,000. The police officer who discovered the lifeless body of Aylan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish shore said he was “crushed deep down” when he realised the boy was dead. Mehmet Ciplak was pictured carrying the three-year-old from the beach in Bodrum in a photo which triggered an international outcry over the refugee crisis. But Mr Ciplak said he had no idea a photographer was taking the image, and was just praying the little boy was still alive as he scooped him up. Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, he told The Mirror: “When I saw the baby on the beach, I approached the baby and said to myself, ‘Dear God, I hope he’s alive’.” My colleague Basia Cummings is at a donations drop for charity CalAid in Dalston, east London. A journalistic trend might be emerging from the migration crisis - asking British politicians if they would house a refugee in their own home. Labour leader contender Yvette Cooper and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister were both asked on Sky News if they’d house a refugee and both said they would do their part. The questions come after songwriter-turned-activist Bob Geldof offered to take in four families and give them shelter in his homes in Kent and London. Germany has been applauded for its apparently more generous approach to the refugee crisis, in comparison to Britain and other countries. However, the Associated Press reports that there are tensions over the crisis between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her coalition partners. The Christian Social Union, the socially-conservative wing of Merkel’s centre-right bloc, has criticised the decision to open Germany’s borders to migrants and refugees stuck in Hungary. Meanwhile, the centre-left Social Democrats, the third member of Merkel’s three-party coalition, urged swift humanitarian help for those trekking through Europe in search of a better life. Thousands arrived in Germany by way of Austria by train, bus and car on Saturday. Most went to Munich, the Bavarian capital, where authorities said some 7,000 people were registered and over half received a bed for the night. Most Germans have been welcoming of the migrants. But far-right groups have protested their arrival, including in Dortmund overnight. Neo-Nazis gathered outside Dortmund’s main train station overnight to protest against the arrival of around 700 refugees by train, marring the otherwise peaceful welcome prepared by locals. The far-right demonstrators called for spontaneous action on social media after hearing that refugees granted passage into Germany from Hungary over the weekend would be sent to Dortmund via Munich. Police said violent scuffles broke out at 1.30 am when around 30 supporters of the fringe neo-Nazi party Die Rechte were attacked by a similar number of anti-fascists. Four were arrested after throwing bottles and fireworks at officers who used pepper spray to break up the fight. Before the refugee train arrived, police escorted the neo-Nazi group out through the station concourse. Within the hour, police said unidentified would-be arsonists tried to set fire to a nearby building intended for use as a refugee home. Guardian reporter Emma Graham-Harrison has this piece on eight life stories from Budapest’s Keleti station. There’s a lot of interest in George Osborne’s comments on the Andrew Marr show about redirecting foreign aid to local councils. Here’s what he said: The foreign aid budget we have - and we’ve increased this foreign aid budget - can provide the support in the first year for these refugees, could help local councils for things like housing costs and we will deploy the foreign aid budget to help with the costs of these refugees. People ask about the pressure on public services, we’ll have extra money to help with that. And here’s some reaction on Twitter: The chancellor, George Osborne, tells the Andrew Marr Show the international aid budget will be diverted to local councils to support refugees in the UK. In an interview focusing on the migration crisis, the chancellor also said the vote against bombing Syria two years ago was “one of the worst decisions the House of Commons has ever made”. He said the government will spend the coming period making an argument to renew military action in Syria. The image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach in Turkey, brought home the “sheer horror” of the migration crisis. That picture brought home ot the British public the sheer horror of what was going on. But Osborne insists policy hasn’t changed and Britain has played a leading role. In terms of numbers of refugees granted asylum, the chancellor says the prime minister will set out the approach to the House of Commons tomorrow. Britain will approach with head as well as heart. We’ll take more refugees but not in a way that encourages them on to these dangerous boats. Osborne says the challenge for the West starts with the problem in Syria, the Assad regime and Islamic State driving people from their homes. The Huddersfield Examiner has interviewed two Syrian refugees in the West Yorkshire town, who have given their take on the UK government’s response to migration crisis. University of Huddersfield student Sleman Shwaish and owner of town centre restaurant Med One, Khalil Khalaf, have urged David Cameron to take refugees who have already made the perilous journey to Europe. “This is an emergency crisis and we must act urgently”, said Sleman, 28, who has been granted a five-year leave to remain after fleeing Syria in 2012 due to attempts to forcibly enlist him into the Assad regime army. “Europe is doing well in its response but should do more, especially the British Government, who needs to have proper talks with EU countries.” Khalaf, who came to Huddersfield in 2003, 25 years after he fled Syria amid fears for his safety. said: “Britain has the power to change the dictatorship and fight against IS by doing more on the ground. “I believe Britain had a role in bringing the Assad family to power so that’s why I think this Government has a responsibility to do all it can.” Anthony Gormley’s iron men statues on Crosby Beach in Merseyside have been blindfolded in a symbolic act intended to raise awareness of the current refugee crisis, the Liverpool Echo reports. Around 80 of the statues had their eyes covered by campaigners hoping to bring attention to the plight of refugees attempting to reach Europe. Chancellor George Osborne is on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One. He is expected to discuss growing calls for a renewed military effort in Syria to tackle Islamic State, which some see as a solution-in-part to the migration crisis. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, became the latest senior figure to call for a renewed military effort to “crush” Islamic State in its Syrian heartlands. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Lord Carey said: “I do not consider it enough to send aid to refugee camps in the Middle East.” His comments echoed the growing impatience among some Conservative backbenchers, with the former defence secretary Liam Fox saying “handwringing” about the plight of the refugees was not enough and action was needed to deal with the “root of the problem”. Cameron remains wary of staging another Commons vote on military action in Syria after his damaging defeat two years ago, unless he can be sure of winning. And with the prospect of left winger Jeremy Corbyn emerging victorious in the Labour leadership contest, parliamentary consensus on action in Syria appear increasingly remote. Our migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley is at the border of Hungary and Serbia. Follow him on Twitter here @PatrickKingsley for live reports. Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of what has been called the worst refugee crisis to have hit Europe since the second world war. As well as rolling news, we will continue to look out for fundraising efforts being made in the UK to help individuals and families who are making the journey, or who are camps across the continent. Thousands of migrants and refugees have arrived by train and bus in cities across Germany overnight, reports the Association Press. Police say a special train with 570 people on board arrived in the Thuringian town of Saalfeld late on Saturday. More than half of them were taken onward to Dresden, where a school for German army officers has been cleared to provide temporary shelter for 350 newcomers. Trains also took migrants to Hamburg in the north and Dortmund in the west of the country, while buses brought more than 300 people to Berlin. Thousands more people, mainly Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fleeing war and persecution, are expected to arrive in Germany and Austria from Hungary on Sunday. The refugees were allowed to leave Hungary on Saturday after the country opened its borders with Austria. The migration crisis dominates the Sunday papers. Here’s a look at what is being reported in some of the papers: The Observer The Observer reports that a former president of the European commission has claimed Britain’s failure to live up to its “moral obligation” to accept a fair quota of refugees from Syria will damage David Cameron’s hopes of achieving a successful renegotiation with Brussels. As the first group of what is expected to be some 10,000 people was greeted in Munich, Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister and commission president, condemned Britain’s stance on the crisis and warned of dire consequences for Cameron ahead of the UK’s in/out EU referendum. The Sunday Times Quoting “senior sources”, the Sunday Times says David Cameron is prepared to accept 15,000 refugees from Syria and wants military action against Isis militants within a month. George Osborne, the chancellor, said the solution to the crisis required action against the “evil” regime of Bashar al-Assad and Isis, in what the newspaper says is a clear signal that the government is preparing to bomb Syria. The Mail on Sunday The Mail on Sunday has commissioned a Survation poll, which suggests that the majority of British people would vote to leave the EU in the wake of the migrant crisis engulfing the continent. If a referendum were to be held tomorrow on whether to remain a member of the union, 51% of British people would vote no. Sunday Telegraph The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, has written an article for the Sunday Telegraph in which he says Britain should “crush” Isis by taking part in military action in Syria. Carey says that it is not enough to send aid to Syria and admit thousands of refugees to this country. Sunday Mirror The Sunday Mirror claims people smugglers are luring refugees aboard their boats by offering desperate families free places for their children. The newspapers’s investigation discovered traffickers have drawn up a “tariff” of prices to tempt migrants on to perilous crossings from Turkey to Greece. If you are out today and see any collections or fundraising efforts – or if you know of interesting activities people are doing to try to help – don’t hesitate to get in touch.

2015-12-02T16:37:28Z,"Guardian refugee appeal reaches £300,000","We have hit the £300,000 mark in our refugee appeal. Thank you, readers! It’s an unprecedented response to our charity appeal, and we have raised this huge amount faster than in any previous year. In fact, with your help, we have raised 549% more than we raised at the same point last year. Some of our readers have got in touch to tell us why they are donating, revealing a variety of compelling reasons: they disagree with what they see as inaction by the government, they don’t think they need the state winter fuel allowance they receive, or they were just very moved by accounts of the humanitarian crisis. Michael Bassey wrote: I’ve just donated my ‘winter fuel £300’ which I get as an octogenarian from our government. My house is warm enough this winter but I grieve for the cold times facing refugees from tyrannical regimes. They need our help. Other readers also said they were donating their winter fuel allowance to charity. One donor wrote: “I passed on my winter fuel allowance. There’s a pleasing irony in refugees being supported by the Department for Work and Pensions.” Martin Harrison, another generous donor, believes we have a moral duty to help. He wrote: We are very lucky and should be doing all we can to assist. After all our government contributed significantly to the wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria by their indiscriminate support of rebel groups, particularly in the supply of arms. I believe I have a responsibility to try to make amends for those government actions that have contributed to causing the refugee crisis. One anonymous donor, deeply frustrated by demeaning language used in discussing the refugee crisis, wrote: This government is so utterly mean spirited, there are many organisations needing support more than ever. The language used by ministers when referring to refugees is so often demeaning and intended to provoke anxieties in Britons so that they will more likely support the government’s harsh approach to those in dire need. Daphne Charles wished everyone could sleep in safety: When I lie in my comfortable bed at night, in my modest house safe from the elements, I wish everyone could have the same for themselves and their families. Another donor echoed this feeling. “I have never before felt such anguish for the plight of people enduring such suffering,” Alison Down wrote, adding: “I was born in 1939 and as I grew up became used to what were stories from adults, but this is happening now in our midst.” Please support our charity appeal. Donate here. Tell us why you care about our refugee appeal, and get involved in the conversation with the hashtag #WeStandTogether."
2015-11-12T20:10:21Z,EU leaders race to secure €3bn migrant deal with Turkish president,"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other EU leaders are racing to clinch a €3bn (£2.4bn) deal with Turkey’s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to halt the mass influx of migrants and refugees into Europe. All 28 national EU leaders are expected to host Erdoğan at a special summit in Brussels within weeks to expedite a pact that would see Turkey patrolling the EU’s southern border with Greece and stemming the flow of hundreds of thousands of refugees, mainly from Syria. In return, Ankara would get €3bn over two years and the EU would also probably agree to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees in Europe directly from Turkey. No EU country, not even Germany, has committed to paying its share of the €3bn bill except Britain. In what appears to be a unique event in David Cameron’s chequered history of relations with the EU, the prime minister, while in the Maltese capital of Valletta, offered €400m for the Turkey plan, the only financial pledge yet delivered. That figure is roughly in line with a breakdown of expected national contributions by the European commission and would make Britain the second biggest participant after Germany. The prospect of a breakthrough with Turkey is tantalising for Merkel, for whom the refugee crisis has posed the biggest problem in 10 years of power. This week her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, likened the arrival of almost 800,000 newcomers in Germany this year to an “avalanche” and appeared to blame the chancellor for the situation by stating that “careless skiers can trigger avalanches”. Facing tumult within her governing coalition and her own party, Merkel looks like a leader seeking relief in a hurry. An emergency EU summit in Valletta heard from EU negotiators on Thursday that Erdoğan was demanding two quick moves by the Europeans to pave the way for a deal – €3bn over two years and a full summit. Senior EU sources said the message from Ankara was that the price tag would rise if it was not accepted now. Merkel wasted no time in agreeing, witnesses to the closed-door summit exchanges said. She told her fellow EU leaders that she was ready to put money on the table and proposed 22 November as the summit date. She later said the date was not set because it had to be agreed with Ankara, but that it would be around the end of the month. The French president, François Hollande, echoed that view. The summit would demonstrate the “very close cooperation” between the EU and Turkey on the refugee crisis, said Merkel, although there has been minimal cooperation so far. Turkey is home to 2.3 million Syrian war refugees and at least 500,000 of them have crossed into Greece this year before trekking through the Balkans heading for Germany. Merkel has long been convinced that a deal with Erdoğan is the key to what she describes as the biggest challenge of her career. But there is strong scepticism across the EU that the increasingly authoritarian Erdoğan is a reliable partner who will deliver, as well as strong reservations about his record on civil and human rights. Merkel emphasised that both sides had a “strong interest in sharing the burdens” set by the refugees and said any deal would need to include a commitment from Ankara to take back non-Turkish migrants who entered the EU via Turkey. In return the EU would speed up moves to loosen visa requirements for 75 million Turks travelling in the EU, a key demand of Erdoğan. “This process can be accelerated,” said the German chancellor. Hollande said he wanted the EU budget, rather than national governments, to bear most of the costs of the deal. Under commission plans, the EU budget would supply €500m and the 28 governments €2.5bn. Turkey would be expected to open its labour market to Syrian refugees and to improve schooling for the estimated 900,000 Syrian children in Turkey. The EU funds would facilitate this, Merkel said. A main aim, she added, was to make “illegal migration” to Europe from Turkey “legal”. This suggests that the putative agreement would entail the EU taking a set number of refugees directly from Turkey every year. In Berlin’s thinking, they would then be spread fairly and on a permanent basis across the EU, a notion that is extremely divisive and contentious. There are various aspects of the proposed Turkey deal that will run into trouble in the EU. Turkey, for example, would need to be declared a “safe country of origin” for refugees to be returned there. Merkel is pushing for that but Sweden opposes it. And while any Turkey deal will not solve the EU’s worst migration crisis, it should help Merkel out of an extremely exposed political predicament at home, allowing her to argue that she is creating order out of chaos, establishing control and predictability over the refugee flows, reducing their numbers and containing the crisis. Her vulnerability was highlighted by Schäuble’s incendiary remarks. “I don’t know whether we are at the stage where the avalanche has already reached the valley or whether we’re still at the top of the slope,” he said. “If we are still at the top, we Germans cannot cope with this alone ... You can trigger an avalanche when a rather careless skier goes on the slope.” While Turkey dominated the emergency EU session, the meeting was preceded by two days of tense summitry with more than 30 African leaders where the EU offered almost €2bn in return for African help in the deportation of unwanted migrants from Europe. African leaders complained that the amount of money was inadequate and “just a start” following two days of fierce negotiations that continued for 21 hours until 5am on Wednesday before the various parties could agree on a compromise package that was described by participants as “lowest common denominator”. “There was very little trust between the sides,” diplomats reported. “There was a lot of tension over the way that the EU handled this.” Even if implemented, the accords will have little quick appreciable impact on the current crisis. The summit was called six months ago when the focus of the refugee movements was across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy. Since then, the Mediterranean route, which many Africans used, has been supplanted by the mass arrivals of Syrians and Iraqis in Europe via Turkey and the Balkans. The Europeans sought to use the Valletta summit to cajole African governments into cooperating on receiving migrants sent back from Europe, while African leaders tried to use the meetings to force the Europeans to open up more legal channels for their people moving to Europe. “For the Africans the summit has been a huge opportunity to push their priorities,” Helen Clark, the former New Zealand prime minister who heads the UN Development Programme, told the Guardian. “One of the most important points here is to push for legal migration. There’s a nod towards that. People end up in the European labour market anyway.”"
2015-09-16T17:59:00Z,Refugees welcome? Not this one,"Last week, in an article about families offering their spare rooms to asylum seekers, G2 featured on its cover a man called Muhammad Sajjad. The 30-year-old from Pakistan had been staying in the spare room of Yoshiko Stokoe and her partner Jack Palmer and with another couple in Leeds. He had since left their home, having begun to receive an asylum seeker’s allowance of just over £5 a day on a prepaid card, along with a room in a shared house, paid for by the Home Office. He was trying to manage his mental health after a number of suicide attempts and was waiting for his solicitor to put together an application for judicial review challenging a decision from the Home Office in May to refuse him asylum. By coincidence, the day the article was published, Sajjad was arrested and taken to Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in west London. He has now been told he has no right to stay and will be sent back on 21st September to Pakistan, where he claims to fear for his life. Stokoe says the Home Office has refused to consider expert evidence from Antislavery International, which said that Sajjad exhibited all the signs of someone who had been trafficked into slavery. Sajjad has also been issued with a letter from his GP, which says that he suffers “long-standing severe and enduring mental health issues” which could not be treated in Pakistan and advises that he is not fit to fly. Sajjad’s story is complicated, but runs essentially as follows: he says that 13 years ago, his family decided he should leave Pakistan, after being beaten up and left for dead because of his father’s political allegiances. Traffickers charged the family the equivalent of £12,000, promising to get him a chef’s visa, accommodation and medical care so that he could work as a sweet chef in a curry house earning £16,000 a year. But when he arrived in Britain in 2006, he found himself forced into domestic slavery. Sajjad then spent six or seven months homeless and destitute before discovering that he could try to claim asylum. The kindness shown to him by Stokoe, Palmer and others in Leeds allowed him to try to get back on track as he got his asylum claim together. “Muhammad dreams of safety and stability in his life; of having a home to welcome people to; of one day opening a restaurant and using his skills as a chef,” said Stokoe. She asks well-wishers to visit keepmuhammadsafe.wordpress.com, the website they have set up, which has suggestions of how to help."
2015-09-23T14:03:34Z,Refugee crisis: EU summit amid resentment over quota deal – as it happened,"European Council President Donald Tusk has warned that the quota plan is not enough in the face of millions of refugees potentially trying to reach Europe. Tusk pointed out that there were a eight million displaced people inside Syria, as well as the four million who had fled the country. We’re pausing the blog for now, but there will be more updates on our refugees page. You can read our latest news wrap, by Ian Traynor, here. The European Commission has left no stone unturned in the search for funding for the refugee crisis, its president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted ahead of the EU summit on migration. He said: “We have almost doubled the resources to tackle the refugee crisis – from € 4.6 billion to € 9.5bn” Juncker set out the key points of further funding measures: €100m more for emergency assistance for the most affected Members States €600m more for the EU agencies in 2016 €200m more for the World Food Program in 2015 €300 million more for humanitarian aid in 2016 Up to €1bn for Turkey € 700 million for Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Here’s a summary of the latest developments: EU leaders are preparing for a tense summit in Brussels dedicated to the continent’s migration crisis, a day after European governments forced through a divisive deal to impose refugee quotas. The summit will focus on the faster screening and fingerprinting of people arriving on the EU’s southern borders and helping neighbouring countries in the Balkans and the Middle East, notably Turkey, to stop people heading for the EU. Slovakia has threatened to take court action against the resettlement quotas. But the other three countries that voted against quotas have reluctantly accepted the plan. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban accused Germany of “moral imperialism” over the refugee crisis. Speaking in Bavaria Orban said: “Even if Germany decides to accept mass migration, please do not make it mandatory for others to do the same.” The European Commission has announced a multi-billion euro package to tackle the refugee crisis including €1bn of aid Turkey and €17m for Serbia. EU president Jean-Claude Juncker said: “It is time for further, bold, determined and concerted action by the European Union, by its institutions and by all its Member States.” Serbia is preparing counter-measures against Croatia if it fails to lift the blockade at its borders. For its part Croatia is reported to be preparing to send refugees back to Serbia if Hungary closes its border with Croatia. Croatia’s state broadcaster showed footage of Hungarian soldiers building a new border fence with Croatia. The UN secretary general’s special representative on migration has urged Britain and France to act immediately to tackle the “horrible conditions” facing refugees in Calais. After a visit to the makeshift camp, dubbed the Jungle, Peter Sutherland, said the conditions there were an indictment to society. The first of 20,000 Syrian refugees to be taken in by the UK have arrived in the country. Britain has refused to take part in the EU refugee-sharing scheme and has an opt out from having to take part. More on the Balkan border merry go round. Serbia is preparing counter-measures against Croatia if it fails to lift the blockade at its borders, Balkan Insight reports. Belgrade is considering blocking any freight coming from Croatia, its source said. “Serbia also has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, which regulates trade relations between two sides. The blockades on the Serbia-Croatian border have practically abolished the SAA. We will strongly protest to the EU because of that,” the source said. Meanwhile, Croatia is reported to be preparing to send refugees back to Serbia if Hungary closes its border with Croatia. Hungary’s hardline prime minister Viktor Orban has accused Germany of “moral imperialism” over the refugee crisis. Speaking in Bavaria Orban said: “Even if Germany decides to accept mass migration, please do not make it mandatory for others to do the same.” AFP adds: When asked what he expected from Merkel while Europe grapples with an influx of asylum-seekers, Orban grinned: “I have a long list.” Orban accused Merkel of trying to impose her vision of an open EU on the rest of the bloc. “The most important thing is that there should be no moral imperialism,” he said during a visit to the southern German state of Bavaria. Orban, speaking ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later Wednesday, said his country had a “democratic right” to a different approach. “We are Hungarians however, we cannot think with German minds. Hungary should have the right to control the impact of a mass migration,” he said. “The Hungarian people don’t want this, we ask that the wishes of Hungarians be respected.” Orban revived recent proposals in what he called a six-point plan to resolve the crisis. They included persuading Greece, one of the EU countries on the front lines of the migrant influx, to hand over control of its borders to EU countries willing to help police them, as well as separating asylum-seekers from “economic migrants” before they reach the passport-free Schengen zone. Orban said he would also press fellow EU leaders to agree on a common list of safe countries of origin to which migrants can be returned, and to pitch in one percent of their EU income and their EU contributions to an emergency fund. The European Union has launched 40 new infringement cases against 19 member states for failing to implement common asylum rules. The European Commission says that elements of the asylum policy not being implemented include legislation focused on speeding up asylum decisions, ensuring humane treatment of asylum-seekers and clarifying grounds for granting asylum. European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans says, “Our common European asylum system can only function if everyone plays by the rules.” Infringement notices have been sent to Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia. Croatia’s state broadcaster has shown footage of Hungarian soldiers building a new border fence with Croatia at Gola in the Koprivnice province. A Dutch MEP has condemned the “inhumane” conditions facing refugees in Croatia after being shown undercover footage filmed by a Dutch reporter posing as a refugee. The footage is due to be broadcast by 3onderzoekt in October. But the filmmaker Danny Ghosen showed the rushes to MEP Judith Sargentini. She commented: “This situation is inhumane. Europe should be ashamed.” The footage is said to show refugees being sent to a fenced off area, under heavy police surveillance. Refuges are reported to be shown in sweltering conditions without cover. In one clip filmed at night refugees complained the camp was like a prison. Sargentini added: “If Croatia cannot cope with the large number of refugees entering the country, it should call for help, instead of hiding the misery. That is also European solidarity.” Croatia’s interior minister Ranko Ostojic refused to answer questions about what foreign reporters uncovered at the camp, according to state broadcaster HRT. But he announced that a new camp area had been opened where refugees do not have to sit in the sun. Speaking from the Opatovac camp, he called for a common European solution to the crisis. “Do not make us suffer, this is torture,” Ostojic pleaded. He added: “We opened two fields at the centre in which to conduct medical screening and security checks. This takes a long time and we had to move the refugees from the area in front of the reception center in order not to stand in the sun but also so the entire area can be cleaned and disinfected” Ostojic said. The European Commission has announced a multi-billion euro package to tackle the refugee crisis including €1bn of aid Turkey and €17m for Serbia. EU president Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU needed to go further than the binding quota plan agreed on Tuesday. He said: “The decision to relocate 160,000 people from the most affected Member States is a historic first and a genuine, laudable expression of European solidarity. It cannot be the end of the story, however. It is time for further, bold, determined and concerted action by the European Union, by its institutions and by all its Member States.” Under the commission’s plans member states will be able to request “rapid border intervention teams” to protect Europe’s borders. It also announced that proposals for legal migration, including a relaxation of work permit rules, will be set out in March 2016. Slovakia will go to court to challenge quotas for distributing asylum-seekers, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced. “We will go in two directions: first one, we will file a charge at the court in Luxembourg... secondly, we will not implement the (decision) of the interior ministers,” Fico told reporters. On Tuesday he said: “As long as I am prime minister, mandatory quotas will not be implemented on Slovak territory.” The UN secretary general’s special representative on migration has urged Britain and France to act immediately to tackle the “horrible conditions” facing refugees in Calais. After a visit to the makeshift camp, dubbed the Jungle, Peter Sutherland, said the conditions there were an indictment to society. The Guardian’s Europe editor Ian Traynor previews the summit: EU leaders are preparing for a tense summit in Brussels dedicated to the continent’s migration crisis, a day after European governments forced through a divisive deal to impose refugee quotas. The leaders did not want their emergency summit on Wednesday evening to be hijacked by an unseemly squabble over quotas and ordered interior ministers to strike a deal in which member states will share 120,000 people between them. The summit will focus on the faster screening and fingerprinting of people arriving on the EU’s southern borders and helping neighbouring countries in the Balkans and the Middle East, notably Turkey, to stop people heading for the EU. The policies presuppose substantial increases in staffing and resources for EU police and border agencies and the ceding of national authority over borders to the same EU agencies, none of which is proceeding quickly. Any summit decision must be unanimous under EU rules, unlike decisions taken at the level of ministers. Romania, one of the four EU states who voted against mandatory quotas, says it can manage the number of refugees the EU plans to send its way under the scheme. President Klaus Iohannis said he regretted that the decision was forced to a vote rather than the negotiated, and insisted that binding quotas were not the solution. Romania has said it can take in a maximum 1,785 of migrants in a voluntary scheme to help ease pressures. Under the relocation scheme it would take in 2,475 people. “The decision has been made. I understand other countries plan to challenge it and we will wait to see the outcome,” Iohannis told reporters. He added: “In reality, the number of refugees Romania must receive during a period of 1-2 years ... is not large. It is manageable and I think Romania must show solidarity.” Of the four dissenting countries only Slovakia has vowed to fight the imposition of quotas. The Serbia-Croatia feud is escalating. Prime Minster Aleksandar Vucic has written to the EU to complain about Croatia’s closed border with Serbia, while his foreign minister Ivica Dacic accused Croatia of leading a “trade war”. Hungary’s anti immigration prime minister Viktor Orbán is not in Brussels for the summit. He’s visiting Bavaria instead. He is holding talks with the prime minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer, who praised Hungary’s tough stance on immigration over the weekend. Germany could not have gained control over the refugee situation if Orbán had not decided to close his country’s borders, Seehofer told the German all-news channel N24. “We will be thankful for what Orbán does”, he said. Hungary has indicated it will reluctantly accept Europe’s decision on quota, but questioned the feasibility of the plan. Zoltán Kovács, a government spokesman, said: “We believe it will be impossible to keep people assigned to, say, Slovakia if they want to go to Germany. How do you keep people in one country if they want to go join their relatives who live in another EU country or want the more favourable social welfare benefits in that country?” Orbán was greeted with protesters. The Czech government, one of four to vote against quotas, is not likely to challenge the European Union’s decision, Reuters reports citing the Czech public news agency CTK. Several ministers from Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s Social Democratic party and from the ANO movement told the agency such a step was not probable as they were arriving for a regular government session. But the Slovak PM, Robert Fico, has pledged to defy it. “As long as I am prime minister, mandatory quotas will not be implemented on Slovak territory,” he told MPs in Bratislava. EU Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has urged the four dissenting member states to respect the EU’s decision on quota. Asked to comment on Slovakia’s intention to resist the imposition of quotas, Timmermans said: “In the European Union, a treaty based organisation, a decision is a decision regardless of the way you voted. The decision is legal, it’s valid and it binds all members.” Austrian police say that about 2,500 migrants and refugees have arrived at the main border point between Austria and Hungary, a day after 5,000 crossed into Austria. Police spokesman Helmut Marban told AP that the new arrivals were bused to the Hungarian side of the Nickelsdorf crossing point early Wednesday. From there they are walking into Austria. Croatia has said it will bus another 4,000 refugees to the Hungarian border after announcing the number of new arrivals in Croatia has increased to 39,000 since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia last week. Interior minister Ranko Ostojic, made the announcement on a visit to the crowded Opatovac transit camp overnight, according to the Croatian news site HRT. Update: The figure for new arrivals has climbed to 44,000 according Croatia’s interior ministry, including a record 8,750 on Tuesday. Hungary has been accepting bus loads of refugees across its border with Croatia. It then buses the refugees to Austria. The Hungarian police reported more than 5,000 new arrivals on Tuesday after the number dropped to a few hundred last week. Croatia’s interior minister Ranko Ostojic has promised thousands of refugees queuing at the Opatovac camp that they will be transferred. Some 4,000 people registered at the camp on Tuesday, according to the BBC’s Anna Holligan who filmed the scene on Periscope. Meanwhile, road traffic between Serbia and Croatia faces continued disruption after truck drives blocked the border crossing at Batrovci, when Croatia decided to allow a limited number of trucks to pass the border, according to Balkan Insight. At least 35,000 migrants, many of them Syrian refugees, have entered Croatia from Serbia since Tuesday last week, when Hungary sealed its border with Serbia. Since the end of last week, Croatia has been bussing new arrivals to the Hungarian border. Croatia says it cannot cope with the numbers, saying Serbia should send them to Hungary and Romania too. Reuters has more on the continuing border feud: Serbia gave Croatia until the end of Wednesday to lift the freight blockade or face political, legal and economic retaliation. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said he had spoken by phone with his Croatian counterpart, Zoran Milanovic, and that they would continue discussions to find a resolution. Without a deal by midnight on Wednesday, he said, Serbia would implement a package of measures against Zagreb. “I believe we will be able to agree with our neighbour,” Vucic said. But, he warned, “Serbia must reply to the destruction of its economic integrity and national policy.” Minutes before he spoke, the Croatian government said it had decided to ease the blockade to allow through only trucks carrying perishable goods. But frustrated drivers were livid, and as night fell they parked several trucks across the main Bajakovo-Batrovci crossing in no-man’s land, halting all road traffic. A new migrant crossing point emerged overnight at the Croatian village of Bapska, with hundreds seen walking through rolling hills to a new camp for 4,000 at Opatovac, which is fast reaching capacity. Several thousand more were waiting in no-man’s land between Sid in Serbia and Tovarnik in Croatia; some spent the night sleeping in a cemetery. The Guardian’s Mona Mahmood has been speaking to Abu Maria, a 40-year-old father of four from Syria, who has just been granted asylum in Sweden I had to leave the Za’atari camp in Jordan by any means. I needed medical treatment for my daughter, Maria, who suffers a mental disorder and has difficulty speaking. There was no proper medication or clean accommodation so her suffering was accute. I had no choice but to smuggle myself to Greece on a crowded boat. I had to borrow $1,500 from a friend in Jordan. The Jordanian authorities were only too happy to allow me to leave. They gave me approval within a day. My plan was to take Maria with me to Europe, but after the drowning of the Syrian kid, Alan Kurdi, I decided to leave her with her mother in Jordan. It took me 15 days to get to Sweden after crossing Greece, Macedonia, Hungary and Germany. I wish I could have gone to England as I speak English, but my friends warned me that I would end up in Calais for months and never be able to get to England. They said that the police were checking lorries and trains heading to England and I might end in jail. I went to the immigration centre in Gothenburg as soon as I stepped off the the ferry to Sweden. To my surprise, I found more than 300 refugee already in a queue. The Swedish authorities took us to a hotel to stay over night and come to apply again on Tuesday. I’m so glad to be in Sweden. I can breathe freedom now. I was suffocating in Jordan. The European Commission has published a useful guide to how the refugee quota system will work. It sets out the individual quotas of refugee that each country will take under the plan. Despite objections from four central European countries they will also be forced to take their share of refugees. Here are the quotas for the dissenting countries: Czech Republic: 1,591 Hungary: 1,294 Romania: 2,475 Slovakia: 802 Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the refugee crisis as an EU summit is set to agree a deal to resettle 120,000 across Europe in the face of opposition from central European states. Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: European governments have forced through a deal to impose refugee quotas, sharing 120,000 people between them in a watershed decision that several states bitterly opposed. The decision to overrule opponents in the newer states of central Europe was perceived as an assault on the sovereignty by the four countries that voted against and sets the scene for a tense summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Wednesday dedicated to the refugee emergency. The first of 20,000 Syrian refugees to be taken in by the UK have arrived in the country. Britain has refused to take part in the EU refugee-sharing scheme and has an opt out from having to take part. The west’s richest countries have been warned that the prospect of a million asylum seekers this year will require an urgent and collective response to the unprecedented refugee crisis that has developed over the past two years. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) called for a comprehensive plan that would provide both immediate humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers and help to integrate them. US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed Europe’s response to the refugee crisis in a phone call on Tuesday. “The two leaders agreed on the need for a Europe-wide solution, in which all European member states accept their fair share of refugees,” the White House said. One of the latest flashpoints in the crisis is the Croatian transit centre in Opatovac where the UNHCR reported that hundreds pushed against fences outside the front gates, awaiting their turn for a “painfully slow registration process”. It said: “The ground near the centre gates was boggy with mud as crowds pressed forward in hopes of any news, and the shadiest spots under the pine trees were crammed tight with men, women and children trying to sleep off the stress.” Options and routes are changing rapidly as countries impose border controls in the absence of a political solution to the continent’s worst humanitarian crisis since the second world war.

2015-09-21T07:31:54Z,Refugee crisis: the tug of war between hospitality and prejudice | Letters,"Lisa Mckenzie’s article (The refugee crisis will hit working-class areas hardest, 17 September) ignores the many working-class people involved in actions to support those caught in the catastrophe unfolding at Europe’s borders (also the many middle-class people who fiercely resist any measures to assist migrants) and focuses instead on fears about asylum-seekers expressed by working-class women in her research. The narratives reported are not dissimilar from those found in the rightwing media: “we” don’t have enough to go around, and migrants are stealing “our” housing/jobs/benefits. References to asylum-seekers’ “disrespect” for women, and the sexual threat they supposedly pose to 15-year-old British girls resonates with a trope peddled by far-right groups such as the British National Party. Had women and girls on this Nottingham estate never been similarly harassed by British nationals? Mckenzie offers no critique of these narratives. Her silence is disturbing. At a moment when anti-migrant and refugee racism is flourishing, it’s vital that as researchers, we carefully contextualise our research findings in wider evidence. And wider evidence actually suggests that the most powerless and stigmatised working-class communities in Britain have much in common with migrants caught in the refugee crisis. Both groups are increasingly, and falsely, represented as burdens to society, threats to the “decent, hardworking majority”, and “undeserving” of rights and social protections. Had Mckenzie drawn out these commonalities, she might have offered a less divisive contribution to debate. Professor Julia O’Connell Davidson University of Nottingham Dr Yasmin Gunaratnam Goldsmiths College Professor Bridget Anderson Centre on Migration, Policy and Society, University of Oxford • There is no zero-sum game between refugees and other working-class people, where more for one group means less for the other. Refugees frequently also contribute to the areas they live, for example in Byker in Newcastle, refugees dispersed in 2000 set up a community centre that became a valued local resource and a place British parents felt their children would be safe after school. British capitalism is international and so is its working class. The presence of refugees within Britain holds potential to build alliances that will strengthen all sections of the working class. Dr Tom Vickers Author of Refugees, Capitalism and the British State • Lisa Mckenzie’s piece is the best story the Guardian has published on migration since the current surge began. But it appeared on page 42. On the front page, you continued moralising about “Fortress Europe”. Your news pages should be about reporting the world as it is, not as you would like it to be. Professor JT Winkler Emeritus professor of nutrition policy, London Metropolitan University • No one country can expect to register and take care of all the refugees. Clearly all the western countries must co-operate in this task. It won’t work to simply fling open the borders. Nor is it logical for a country to indicate a finite number of refugees. Each country should agree to admit a certain number of refugees per year, depending on space, resources and ability to cope etc. There has to be some order and common sense. Perhaps each country could decide on a proportion of their quota to be taken in per day/week, depending on how many its officials can register and care for until they are able to recover from the trauma and care for themselves. If refugees knew that a border would be open for a certain number that day and then would re-open on the following days, there may be less unrest and panic. Carole Martin Manchester • What we are finding now is a tug of war between empathy and apathy, and hospitality and prejudice. Europeans are more accustomed to arriving on faraway lands and claiming territory than sharing their homelands with foreigners. Refugees, though, are not merely foreigners. They are foreigners with a particular baggage. Interviews with mental health professionals reveal unimaginable traumas. We have witnessed the loss of life resulting from the dangerous routes to Europe. However, we have been less aware of the silent deaths at the hands of people smugglers and the violence that refugees face on their journey. EU leaders need to reach refugees much closer to their point of crisis. Why wait until they have endured further traumas on their journey? Refugees need mental health protection as well as physical safety. The key is in prevention. Dr Ayesha Ahmad London • The UK government is reluctant to give succour or sanctuary to those in desperate need of it, but is happy to welcome arms manufacturers to London (Report, 15 September). Among the customers invited to the London Arms Fair were Gulf states such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which have not only refused to take in any refugees from the region but have supplied arms, money and encouragement to Isis and other anti-Assad factions which actively support (so the government tell us) acts of terrorism against UK interests. Meanwhile we have adopted a policy of targeted killings using drones, which will inevitably cause the death of innocent civilians, as they have done in every other theatre of war in which they have been used. In Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan drones have recruited more extremists than they kill. The government’s strategy is confusing; no help for refugees, sell weapons to help prolong and exacerbate conflicts, use drones to promote extremists, and give continued support to regimes in the region that have closed their borders and aid our enemies. Charles Bird Blairgowrie, Perth and Kinross • The unwelcoming attitude to refugees in the UK (questioned by Robert Winder in We took Huguenots..., Opinion, 18 September) is the result of an unfriendly business “community” insisting that all workers are a cost burden, not just those seeking refuge from abroad. Plenty of businesses are whining that the Tory-imposed living wage will put up their costs, without considering for one moment that, in aggregate, it will put up sales by increasing demand. What a contrast to Germany where the Greens welcome refugees because they can be put to work earning enough to pay their way! DBC Reed Northampton • Neither Robert Winder nor Paul Anderton (Letters, 19 September) mentions the Hungarian refugees given asylum in Britain during the 1956 uprising. Perhaps Hungarians have forgotten this too? Sally Waterson Coventry"
2015-12-24T16:07:33Z,Readers share their reasons why they have donated to our appeal,"Many of the readers who have generously donated to the Guardian and Observer appeal for refugees have been personally touched by the issue. We spoke to three donors – a former child refugee, the captain of a ferry and the daughter of Jewish refugees – about what inspired them to support the appeal. Carry Gorney: ‘I’m here by chance’ Carry Gorney’s parents left Germany on their wedding day, their guests running down the station platform to wave them goodbye. It was 1937; the Jewish couple never saw their guests again. They spent their honeymoon travelling through the Balkans. Traumatised from leaving his home, Gorney’s father was sick for the entire journey. They left to seek refuge in the UK, but her father was interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. He was carrying only a suitcase. They were not allowed to take money into the UK, but he did bring 78 classical records. “He was obsessed with music,” says Gorney. Inspired by her parents’ story, Gorney has spent her life telling the stories of marginalised people through the arts, including street theatre and film. She was moved by her parents’ letters to tell their story in a book – and to support the refugee appeal. “I’m here by chance,” she says. I want to give those children shivering under tents the same chance. I’m desperate – I can’t bear these people walking through Europe. It’s just a nightmare. Bill Londesborough: ‘You can’t help but think in their situation you’d be doing exactly the same’ As the captain of a Channel crossing between Dunkirk and Dover, Bill Londesborough witnesses the refugee crisis on a daily basis. Refugees and migrants come to Dunkirk’s port every night. They are predominantly young men, thin and “obviously suffering from malnutrition”, he says. In the five years prior to this summer, Londesborough had witnessed people making occasional attempts to cross the Channel, but since security was tightened in Calais he has noticed a huge increase in numbers. Last night was very quiet, he tells me, but for the last two weeks people have managed to get into the port, coming through the canal or scaling the high razor-wire fences. He remembers one young man who was killed after falling from the truck under which he had stowed himself. He recalls another who hauled himself up the taut ship rope, braving a drop of 15-20 metres near the top. He managed to clamber on board, only to be escorted off the ship and out of the port by the French authorities. The guy that spotted him climbing the rope didn’t want to shout for fear he would spook him and he would fall off. When he got to the top, you would expect him to be really disappointed but it was just absolute acceptance – that attempt had failed. He will make another attempt. That is his life. Londesborough, 62, says it has changed his perception of refugees and migrants – and prompted him to support the appeal. Until you experience things, they don’t necessarily touch you as much as they should. In my professional life they present us with a problem, but it’s extremely sad, you can’t help think that in the same situation you’d be doing exactly the same. It seems so hopeless. Stefan: ‘We didn’t have more than two coins to rub together’ Stefan – not his real name – was five years old when his family arrived in the US as refugees. He was born in Sweden soon after his parents arrived there having fled from Latvia during the second world war, on a boat captained by his grandfather. When we came to America we didn’t have more than two coins to rub together. We lived in the attic of a Latvian church in New York,” he remembers. His parents found work, his mother as a cleaner and his father in a factory, putting heads on dolls. Stefan donated to the appeal after his daughter requested it in lieu of a Christmas present. He doesn’t find it hard to draw a comparison between his family’s crisis then and that of refugees arriving in Europe today. My parents both worked really hard and never complained. They never thought life owed them anything. When I see these people in the newspapers landing in rubber dinghies on Lesbos and beginning this long trek to Germany – people with resilience and hopefulness – it’s apt for the Christmas season. Regardless of the insanity in the world, human beings are survivors and they’re trooping across Europe. All money raised goes to fund the vital work being done at sea, at home and in the refugee camps by the six charities chosen for our appeal – Red Cross, Migrant Offshore Aid Station, Doctors of the World, Refugee Council, City of Sanctuary and Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.

2015-11-28T07:00:01Z,Refugees tell a different Berlin story,"On a chilly winter’s day in Berlin, it’s hard to imagine how Oranienplatz looked 18 months ago. From October 2012 to April 2014, the tree-lined square in Kreuzberg was the heartland of the German refugee movement, occupied by refugees and activists in protest at the state’s asylum policy. Now it’s gone back to being a largely unassuming urban space, but for those who lived there in that time, the square still holds significant meaning. “It’s beautiful,” says Mohamed, a Sudanese refugee who arrived in Europe four years ago. “And it was the place where we had people we could meet and communicate with.” His story forms part of the Refugee Voices tour, a new initiative giving visitors and Berlin residents the chance to hear first-hand the experiences of refugees. The tour, launched last month, is a collaboration between local guide and refugee activist Lorna Cannon, Mohamed and fellow refugee Moha. They hope that by next spring they will have more refugees involved. A Syrian-led tour about coming to Germany is also being planned. “We were already telling stories, giving tours to newly arrived refugees,” Moha tells me. “But tourists kept asking us about what had happened. We felt the best way was if we told it.” We hear about the pair’s journey to Germany. Moha’s passage from Somalia cost him $18,000: a family member sold two properties to raise the money. Mohamed travelled by boat from Libya to Italy in 2011. He sits on the floor, legs apart, to demonstrate the way refugees were crammed together on boats for days at a time. Their legs would stop working, which is why so many drowned if they fell in the water. While the tours are an opportunity to hear incredible stories that most people only read about in the news, the tours also have a political aim: to preserve and acknowledge the birth of the refugee community in Berlin. Our guides tell the story of the Oranienplatz occupation, including how the tents were eventually cleared by police. Sudanese refugee Napuli Langa climbed a tree in the square and spent a week on hunger strike as the police closed in. We move on to a former school on Ohlauer Strasse, which was occupied after the clearing of Oranienplatz. The authorities evicted most residents from there, too, in dramatic scenes involving riot police and refugees threatening to jump from the roof. Now it is an official refugee centre. Mohamed is the only one of the 25 original residents still living there. Nearby Gorlitzer Park is best-known as a place to score drugs, but it is another important social spot for refugees in the city. When the tour ends, we’re invited for lunch with a weekly cooking group for refugees, run by Give Something Back to Berlin, which was founded in 2013 to bring together all visitors to the city – be they short- or long-term, privileged tourist or refugee. As I warm up with a generous portion of the group’s Sudanese curry, Mohamed tells me what the tours mean to him: “Living in the school, you’re in isolation. The conditions aren’t good and no one can visit. So when I get a chance to tell people what I feel inside, I have a good feeling.” He points to his chest. “I relax somehow.” • Refugee Voices tours run at 2pm on Saturdays, starting at Oranienplatz, payment by donation, facebook.com/refugeevoicestours"
2015-12-14T12:52:12Z,Angela Merkel pledges to cut German immigration figures but rejects limit,"Angela Merkel has promised to “tangibly” reduce the number of refugees and migrants entering Germany in an attempt to quell a rebellion in her conservative ranks, but rejected calls to impose a cap on immigration. At a gathering of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Merkel said Germany would pursue a range of measures to stem the flow of asylum seekers, expected to reach about 1 million this year. “Even a strong country like Germany would in the long run be unable to cope with such a large number of refugees,” the chancellor said in a one-hour long speech. “We want to tangibly reduce the number of refugees arriving. With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.” However, she said Germany had a “moral and political” duty as Europe’s top economic power to continue to help desperate people, particularly those from war-ravaged Syria. “We will live up to our humanitarian responsibility,” she said. “The refugee crisis is a historic test for Europe, which I am convinced it will pass. Even if everything we do in Europe is interminably arduous” After weeks of increasingly vocal dissent from the right wing of the CDU, many commentators had expected the party conference in Karlsruhe to be the stage for a showdown between Merkel and her critics. Instead, Merkel emerged from the gathering largely unchallenged, with an overwhelming majority of delegates voting in support of her roadmap for dealing with the refugee crisis. Only two delegates voted in favour against her proposals. She drew loud applause as she repeated her rallying cry: “We can do it.” A nine-minute standing ovation was brought to a close by the chancellor herself telling the 1,000 delegates that “we still have work to do”. Having effectively squashed any rebellion over upper limits on arrivals before the party conference, Merkel still sought to address lingering concerns over the long-term consequences of the refugee crisis. “Those who seek refuge with us also have to respect our laws and traditions, and learn to speak German,” she said. “Multiculturalism leads to parallel societies, and therefore multiculturalism remains a grand delusion.” Her comments echoed a similar statement from 2010, when Merkel said multiculturalism had “utterly failed”. Merkel appealed to the party’s sense of history, saying that the same strength that allowed it “to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle, and to go from division to a reunified country”, would get Germany through the refugee crisis. Merkel condemned rich countries for failing to properly fund the UN refugee agency and World Food Programme, saying this was unforgivable. Before an EU summit this week, Merkel said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut refugee numbers, urging stronger protection for the bloc’s external borders, support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states. She touted a range of measures currently being undertaken in Germany, including extending a list of safe countries of origin, expediting repatriation of rejected asylum seekers and increasing staff levels to help process applicants. Germany is divided roughly down the middle by the refugee issue, with a poll on Friday showing 49% opposed Merkel’s stance while 47% supported it. The CDU is polling at about 39%, 2.5 points off its performance in the 2013 general election and far ahead of the SPD on 24%."
2015-10-26T07:55:44Z,"EU and Balkans agree plan for 100,000 places in reception centres for refugees","European Union and Balkan leaders meeting in Brussels have agreed a 17-point plan to cooperate on managing the flows of refugees making their way through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans in a bid to reach places such as Germany and Scandinavia before winter. The European commission said that among the measures agreed between the 11 nations were that 100,000 places in reception centres should be made available along the route from Greece towards Germany, half in Greece and half in the countries to the north. The UN refugee agency would help establish them. The leaders also agreed that the EU border agency Frontex would step up its activities on the Greek-Macedonian border to ensure that people trying to cross would be registered. “We have made very clear that the policy of simply waving people through must be stopped,” Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission’s president, told reporters, referring to agreements to cooperate and avoid unilateral national measures that have contributed to chaos throughout the region. The German chancellor Angela Merkel, who pushed for the meeting to be convened, said: “Europe must show it is a continent of values, a continent of solidarity ... This is a building block, but we need to take many further steps.” But before the meeting had started on Sunday, the plan under discussion had already drawn criticism for proposing that Balkan and eastern European countries should stop allowing asylum seekers to pass through to other neighbouring countries without first securing agreement from those neighbours. The Croatian prime minister, Zoran Milanović, said before the summit that such consultation was “impossible”. The Slovenian prime minister, Miro Cerar, had warned that the EU would “start falling apart” if it failed to take concrete action to tackle the refugee crisis within the next few weeks. Slovenia, a country of 2 million people, has seen more than 60,000 new arrivals in recent days. The focus of the crisis turned to Slovenia when Hungary clamped down on its border with Serbia, prompting the refugees to switch to Croatia, which in turn imposed border controls. The plan submitted by Juncker seeks to slow the passage of migrants through the safe corridor that has formed through central and eastern Europe towards Austria and Germany by increasing border surveillance, properly registering transient people, and stopping bus and train transfers to the next border without the consent of the neighbouring country. “The immediate imperative is to provide shelter,” said Juncker after chairing the summit. “It cannot be that in the Europe of 2015 people are left to fend for themselves, sleeping in fields.” Nearly 250,000 refugees have passed through the Balkans since mid-September, many fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The plan’s main points To increase reception capacity to 30,000 places by the end of the year in Greece. The UN refugee agency will provide rent subsidies and host family programmes for at least 20,000 more people. To seek additional capacity of 50,000, reaching a total of 100,000 along the western Balkans route and Greece. To deploy 400 police officers within a week to Slovenia. To step up efforts to facilitate return of migrants not in need for international protection and step up cooperation on repatriation with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iraq and Pakistan. To scale up the Poseidon Sea joint operation in Greece, in particular the EU’s border agency Frontex’s presence in the Aegean Sea, and strengthen significantly Frontex support to Greece in registering and fingerprinting activities. To refrain from facilitating the movement of migrants to the border of another country. To set up contact points to allow daily exchanges of information regarding migrant movements. To exchange information on the size of movement and flows of refugees. Frontex as well as the EU’s asylum office ESAO will put this exchange of information in place. To contact financial institutions including the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to secure finances for accommodation of refugees. To step up police and judicial cooperation actions against migrant smuggling, engaging Europol and Interpol in Western Balkan route operations. To reinforce support of the bloc’s border agency Frontex at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. To set up a new Frontex operation at the external land borders between Greece and Macedonia and Greece and Albania to focus on exit checks and registration of refugees who were not registered in Greece. Working together with Frontex to detect irregular border crossing and support registration and fingerprinting in Croatia."
2015-12-16T19:24:18Z,Effective action on borders is key to Britain’s referendum vote | Editorial,"This week’s European Union summit in Brussels was once seen as being the crunch moment for David Cameron’s timetable to reform Britain’s relations with the EU in advance of the planned referendum. Recently, however, a combination of much more pressing Europe-wide issues, notably migration and terrorism, plus some stuttering progress in Mr Cameron’s discussions with fellow EU leaders, have pushed the timetable back. As Sir John Major put it on Wednesday, this summit is not high noon. Instead it could be yet another occasion for burning the midnight oil. That’s because this summit is set to be dominated by another effort to rescue the credibility of the EU’s external and internal borders in the face of Europe’s refugee crisis. Britain’s grievances must therefore wait their place in the queue. February 2016 is now the date when Mr Cameron intends to obtain the “binding and irreversible deal” that he seeks in order to win the public’s backing for the UK to remain in the EU. That date would still allow the referendum to be held in June. After all, Greece organised its bailout referendum this summer at a week’s notice. There is, though, an umbilical connection between the summit’s preoccupation with migration and borders and the continuing British focus on the UK’s relationship with the EU. When Mr Cameron originally proposed a referendum, back in January 2013, migration and EU borders were much further down the agenda than they are today, or than they are likely to be when the vote eventually takes place. The Bloomberg speech was principally about the eurozone crisis and the place of national sovereignty within a union of 28 states. Words like migrant and refugee did not appear in it at all. The word “border” appeared only once, almost as an aside. A mere three years later, however, the context is utterly changed. The UK’s concerns about a multi-speed Europe, and whether the rights of non-eurozone member states are adequately protected within the union’s workings, remains an important issue for the committed on both sides but they are not, perhaps shortsightedly, a big popular anxiety. Arguments about national sovereignty remain intense, in Britain as elsewhere, but now because of the backdrop of the refugee crisis rather than of EU-wide fiscal disciplines, as in the aftermath of the eurozone crisis. The referendum campaign, when it finally gets into gear, will inevitably reflect this new context. The shift against EU membership in recent polls may already do so. At a meeting organised by the Centre for European Reform this week, Conservative speakers from all wings of the party argued that, irrespective of what the pro- or anti-Europeans may want, the vote will in fact be shaped by the migration issue. It is hard to disagree with that. To say this is not to say that the older fiscal and sovereignty issues of the Maastricht era or the four heads of Mr Cameron’s negotiating strategy are irrelevant now. In the end, the referendum will still turn on whether the pro-Europeans can marshal a confident case about the benefits of Britain’s future in Europe while also puncturing the many myths about a go-it-alone exit. But the case for Europe must also contain an effective and balanced argument about borders, migration and refugees too, as Angela Merkel has this week acknowledged in the German context. That is why this EU summit is so important. Europe failed the test on refugees this year. Next year – referendum year, perhaps – the test will come again. This week’s summit, which will be asked to back European commission plans to get a humane collective grip on the EU’s borders, is central to the credibility of the union that UK voters will soon be asked to vote on. Britain has a massive interest in making sure the border control system works better. This is therefore a key summit. Mr Cameron should go to it not aiming to stop Europe being effective, as UK prime ministers often do, but aiming to make sure that EU action really works this time."
2015-08-15T23:03:14Z,The readers’ editor on… the semantics of migration | Stephen Pritchard,"Distressing scenes of Syrian refugees bottled up in a football stadium on the Greek island of Kos and pictures of migrants in France existing in miserable conditions near the Channel Tunnel have become all too familiar this summer. The news seems unrelentingly grim, with this newspaper reminding us that while the British press seems obsessed with the wretched souls gathered in Calais, other European nations have been in the grip of an emergency every bit as acute. Earlier this year, after we published a vivid account of the plight of refugees fleeing across the Mediterranean, we were cautioned by a representative of Rosa, a charity giving support to women and girls in the UK, that the term “migrant” should be used with care. It had become loaded with negative connotations, helping serve an agenda that sought to discourage sympathy for those making the desperate – and often deadly – crossing to a new life. Where we knew that people were fleeing war and persecution (something that is never easy to establish) we should call them refugees. Robert McNeil of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford also believes the term “migrant” has become a negative label, morphing from merely referring to a person who moves between countries (the UN definition) to a pejorative term, particularly in the vocabulary of tabloid journalists. There was a need, he said, for the word to be reclaimed as a neutral term for those on the move, pointing out that an migrant can just as easily be a Saudi billionaire moving to Mayfair as a poor north African seeking a basic standard of living in Marseille. Research by Professor Bridget Anderson illustrates just how hard it is to define the word: “When counting migrants and analysing the consequences of migration, who counts as a migrant is of crucial importance. Yet there is no consensus on a single definition of a ‘migrant’. Migrants might be defined by foreign birth, by foreign citizenship or by their movement into a new country to stay temporarily or to settle for the long term. “Some analyses even include children who are UK born or UK nationals, but whose parents are foreign born or foreign nationals, in the migrant population. None of these definitions are equivalent and none fit precisely with ‘migrant’ defined as an individual who is subject to immigration controls.” Perhaps because the term is so difficult to define, the UK is pretty confused about who these people are. In 2011, the Migration Observatory commissioned a poll that sought to establish who the public had in mind when thinking about immigrants. It found that respondents were most likely to think of asylum seekers (62%) and least likely to think of students (29%). Statistics at the time showed that students made up the largest group of immigrants coming to the UK (37%) while asylum seekers were the smallest group (4%). Terminology employed by politicians and the media is crucial to public understanding of any issue, yet the semantics around the movement of people seem particularly highly charged. In Australia, the language used by governments and media to discuss those who arrive “irregularly” by sea has changed dramatically. Reuters Institute fellow Ben Doherty, a Guardian journalist, has found that asylum seekers, once called refugees and boat people, are now officially referred to in government statements as “illegals”. Ministers have publicly alleged they “could be murderers [or] terrorists” and report “whole villages” are coming to Australia in uncontrollable “floods”. Australia’s policies are now framed as a matter of “border protection” from “threats to national security”. This year, we have heard politicians claim that the vast majority of migrants to Europe are travelling for economic reasons; that they are “marauders”, arriving in “swarms”. Journalists tempted to repeat these claims need to remember the figures: the 200,000 migrants who have arrived in Europe this year represent 0.027% of Europe’s 740m population, and 70% of them are genuine refugees, having fled war zones. Only about 1% have reached Calais. • Many thanks to those who took part in our snap poll to decide style for yes and no campaigns in referendums (readers had complained that the current lower case style was confusing). An overwhelming 89% voted to use initial capitals, so it’s yes to Yes… and yes to No. Please note that the readers’ editor email address has changed to observer.readers@observer.co.uk"
2015-09-23T12:08:57Z,The negative narrative on migrants is changing - but not swiftly enough | Michael Møller,"As the refugee influx continues unabated, it is gratifying to see that our humanity is finally showing signs of life, thanks to generous German, Serbian, Austrian, Greek, Italian and other European citizens. They follow the proud example of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Egypt. Our leaders are at last heeding what their voters are telling them and starting to question the pandering to anti-immigration voices. The negative narrative on refugees and migrants is beginning to change, allowing the facts to prevail: there are clear economic and social benefits to those countries receiving migrants. And most European and other developed economies need immigration to meet present and future workforce requirements. This is a positive development, but it is not enough. All countries should contribute towards solving the problem. In finding the necessary international solution, we can draw on our collective institutional memory. This is not the first time we have faced a refugee exodus of this magnitude. In the 1980s, thousands of Vietnamese boat people took to the seas to reach neighbouring countries and, from there, the US, Canada and other nations. Thousands died, human traffickers made fortunes and the countries of first asylum sealed their borders. The problem seemed intractable – until enterprising staff at the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) devised a comprehensive plan of action, approved by an international conference in 1989. Bringing together the international community, it created an orderly process that distinguished between and established procedures for asylum seekers and economic migrants. This mechanism successfully resettled thousands of refugees, all of them now productive members of the societies that welcomed them. It is a good example of how things can be done when there is the will and the means to protect and assist in a humane and dignified manner. For this example to be successful today, we need to: 1. Set up screening centres in transit countries such as Turkey, Greece, Italy, perhaps Tunisia and potentially Libya, when conditions permit, with the UNHCR and International Organisation for Migration (IOM) handling the refugees and migrants. Universally agreed procedures to establish refugee status, resettlement and the return to countries of origin of economic migrants should be respected throughout. 2. Step up temporary search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean. 3. Co-ordinate robust programmes to apprehend people smugglers. 4. Negotiate agreements with countries of origin of those determined economic migrants for their safe return and reintegration, where possible. 5. Fund these measures on a global level and assist with meeting the costs of primary receiving countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Greece, as well as funding more targeted development interventions in the countries of origin. 6. Initiate information campaigns aimed at potential asylum seekers and economic migrants, explaining the procedures that are in place and the risks inherent in taking to the roads. 7. Change the negative narrative in receiving countries based on social and economic facts. These actions may prove that enlightened self-interest, humanity and international solidarity can produce a win-win outcome. But this will only address the current temporary spike in refugee numbers. We need to deal with the much broader, long-term migratory trend. At the operational level, the agencies that manage asylum and migration issues are overwhelmed and underfunded. At the policy level, apart from the loosely organised Global Forum on Migration and Development, there is no formal international structure to provide options for future flows of the victims of man-made or natural (read climate-related) disasters, both of which will define our daily lives far into the future. In the absence of such a body, we need to give Sir Peter Sutherland, the UN secretary-general’s special representative for migration and development, the mandate and wherewithal to catalyse action. One way to start the process may be to decide on greater integration of the work of UNHCR and IOM, and allowing them to propose new long-term global policies. The humanitarian summit in Istanbul next year, the meeting called by the UN secretary-general in New York in September and the November meeting in Valletta between the heads of state of Europe and Africa are opportunities to move this forward. Critically, we need to recalibrate the relationship between development aid and humanitarian assistance, with aid better addressing the root causes of humanitarian problems. The high commissioner for refugees António Guterres is a tireless proponent of this thesis. He needs our support. Finally, we need to capitalise on the policy frameworks the world is adopting this year: the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a climate agreement and the disaster risk reduction agreement. If we successfully implement the 17 SDGs we will stand an immeasurably better chance of dealing with future migratory flows. Any one of us may one day need refuge. Empathy, generosity and sound policies today will greatly improve the chances of the same being applied to our calamities tomorrow."
2015-11-09T10:14:59Z,Images of drowned boy made only a fleeting change to refugee reporting,"Newspapers in western Europe became significantly more sympathetic towards migrants and refugees immediately after the publication of photographs of the lifeless body of Alan (aka Aylan) Kurdi on a Turkish beach. But within a week of the pictures of the three-year-old boy having been published most of the papers had reverted to their original editorial stance. And, according to research carried out by the European Journalism Observatory (EJO) network, by the end of the month all were less positive towards migrants than at the beginning.* The finding emerged in a detailed analysis of the press coverage in eight countries of the flight of Syrian refugees: How European newspapers covered the migration crisis. (This posting is based on a report of the study by Caroline Lees).** It revealed distinct national trends in how the story was reported; political bias in some newspapers that transcended national boundaries; and the fact that most papers in eastern Europe and the Baltic states did not publish the photographs and barely covered the story. Researchers looked at how three newspapers in each country - representing broadly left, right and tabloid newspapers - covered three pivotal events concerning migrants in September. These events were the photographs of Alan Kurdi (2 September); the day Germany introduced border controls (13 September); and the EU summit aimed at agreeing a common European approach to the crisis (23 September). Then they graded the coverage as positive (compassionate, sympathetic, humane), negative (describing migrants as economic or “illegal”, possibly infiltrated by terrorists, violent, “mobs”, being a “drain on society”) or objective (neutral factual reporting). Newspapers in Britain - the Guardian, Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail - in Germany, Italy and Portugal devoted considerable space to the crisis and covered it in more detail than elsewhere. In Germany, Italy and Portugal positive humanitarian stories about migrants increased three-fold immediately after the photographs were published. In the UK the number of positive humanitarian stories across the three newspapers studied also increased, but were fewer (although I detected a genuine change of heart at the time). But, in all four countries, the number of positive humanitarian stories had decreased by 12 September to nearly the level they had been before the Kurdi photographs. This demonstrates, says the report, that the surge in sympathetic coverage after the photographs did not signify a long-term shift in media opinion, but appeared to be - as some analysts had suspected - a short-term emotional reaction to the boy’s death. As for newspapers in eastern European and the Baltic, they devoted significantly less space to the crisis. Only three newspapers of the 12 studied in this group published the Kurdi images and some criticised Germany and the EU for being “too emotional” over the crisis. None of the Latvian papers in the study published the pictures or mentioned the story, apart from one negative comment about children being used as a propaganda tool. Only one Ukraine newspaper published the photographs. In the British newspapers, the number of “domestic positive” articles (those urging the government to take in more refugees and lamenting that not enough was being done) increased from zero in the two days before the Kurdi photographs to seven in the two days after. But the situation reverted to only two positive stories one week later, and was back down to zero two weeks later. Stories about the migrants as a domestic issue in Germany – the country that agreed to accept the highest number - were already overwhelmingly positive before the Kurdi photographs and remained so throughout September. However, by the end of the month, the number of positive articles had begun to decline in Germany. Unsurprisingly, the study found that conservative newspapers across Europe were significantly more negative when covering the impact of migrants on their own countries. They were also more critical of the European Union’s response to the crisis. In Italy, the right-leaning Il Giornale was particularly negative towards the migrants in a domestic context. The right-leaning UK titles, the Telegraph and Mail, in company with Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Czech Republic’s Mlada fronta Dnes and Poland’s Rzeczpospolita, also tended to be more negative in their coverage of the domestic consequences of the migration crisis and their government’s handling of it. Again unsurprisingly, left-leaning newspapers, such as Guardian in the UK, die Tageszeitung (taz) in Germany and La Repubblica in Italy carried more sympathetic, pro-refugee coverage in general. Analysts were surprised, however, by initial coverage in the German tabloid, Bild, which is often equated with the Sun in Britain. Throughout September, despite a traditional editorial line that has stoked anti-migrant prejudice, it published a large number of sympathetic humanitarian stories. Tina Bettels-Schwabbauer, editor of the EJO’s German site, said this prompted scepticism from many in the media who wondered how long Bild’s enthusiasm for migrants would last. “Their scepticism was justified,” she noted “By the beginning of October, Bild’s headlines had reverted to reflect their more typical stance” which “could be one of the first hints that the tabloid is changing sides again.” The second key event - Germany’s reintroduction of border controls - also provoked strongly negative reactions from some countries, but also divided opinion along political lines. And an analysis of EU-related stories in the UK revealed that its papers carried several negative articles about the EU’s handling of the crisis after 13 September, and of the ability of its members to solve it. On 11/12 September, the three UK titles ran a total of only two negative and two positive stories about the EU and its response to the crisis. But on 14/15 September, there were no positive stories; 12 were negative and only two were objective. According to the study, coverage in the British press remained overwhelmingly negative towards the EU’s handling of the crisis after this date until the end of the month. Notably, say the researchers, the Guardian changed from generally positive to generally negative coverage of the EU after 13 September. Writing about “disarray” in the EU, one Guardian columnist acknowledged the crisis had “played into the hands of the Eurosceptics”. (NB: this was an article by Hugo Dixon, who is a freelance contributor to the Guardian, and not a regular columnist). Elsewhere, there was a significant increase in negative stories about the EU in Poland and the Czech Republic after the 13 September introduction of border controls. Czech papers, reflecting the impact of Germany’s decision to reinstate controls at the Austrian border, remained overwhelmingly negative towards Angela Merkel and EU policies from the 13 September for the rest of the month. German newspaper coverage remained positive towards the migrants even after introduction of the border controls but newspapers became more negative towards the EU after that date. All German outlets published negative articles about how other EU countries were handling the crisis, their reluctance to collaborate and accommodate more migrants. *Eight websites, all part of the EJO network, collaborated in the study. The researchers were Caroline Lees, England; Roman Hajek, Czech Republic; Tina Bettels-Schwabbauer and Anna Carina Zappe, Germany; Philip Di Salvo, Italy; Adam Szynol and Michal Kuś, Poland; Ana Pinto Martinho, Portugal; Liga Ozolina, Latvia; Halyna Budivska, Ukraine. Among the studied newspapers were: UK: Telegraph, Guardian, Mail; Germany: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Bild, taz. Italy: Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, Il Giornale. Poland: Gazeta Wyborcza, Rzeczpospolita, Fakt. Latvia: Latvijas Avīze, Diena, Vesti Segodņa. Ukraine: Den. **NB: The study uses the term ‘migrants’ to cover both migrants and refugees.

2015-12-31T09:00:40Z,The sporting stars who were once refugees,"The Guardian and Observer’s charity appeal for refugees was in response to an intercontinental crisis that has seen more than 1 million refugees and migrants arrive on European shores, many having fled their homeland. There has been an outpouring of support from readers around the world. These refugees are often seen as victims of circumstances beyond their control, but there is another story to be told about refugees – a story of strength, determination and success. Many of the world’s top athletes have excelled at their sport having fled war-torn countries. Here we celebrate some of the world’s best known competitors who were once refugees. In October, the International Olympic Committee announced that refugee athletes would be able to compete at the 2016 Rio Games, even if they have no country to represent. Thomas Bach, the IOC president said: Having no national team to belong to, having no flag to march behind, having no national anthem to be played, these refugee athletes will be welcomed to the Olympic Games with the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem Whether in the football Premier League, basketball’s NBA or at the Olympics, their achievements in the sporting arena are all the more remarkable given their respective journeys. Luol Deng Perhaps Britain’s finest basketball player of all time, Luol Deng has been an NBA star for many years and led Team GB at the 2012 Olympics. Currently playing for Miami Heat, Deng spent 10 years with the Chicago Bulls and has previously been selected for the NBA’s All-Star team. Deng, 30, comes from the Dinka tribe in Sudan, a country devastated by civil war. His family moved to Alexandria in Egypt and Deng did not see his father for four years, before they were granted political asylum in south London, leaving for America when he was 14. Barack Obama invited him to the White House, saying Deng was one of his favourite players . Saido Berahino Saido Berahino, the West Bromwich Albion forward, has frequently been in the news but his road to the Premier League is rarely mentioned. The England Under-21 international, known for his speed and agility in attack, lost his father in the Burundi civil war, another African conflict that resulted in significant numbers fleeing. Berahino travelled to England alone aged 10, where he was reunited with his mother and siblings who had already left his homeland. Guor Mading Maker A long-distance runner who ran for his life and now runs for pride. Guor Mading Maker, formerly Guor Marial, finished 47th in the marathon at London 2012 (with a time of 2:19:32), but will represent South Sudan for the first time in an Olympics at Rio next year. The world’s newest country will be represented in Brazil, with Mading Maker having previously run under an Olympic flag in London rather than Sudan’s, the country he fled as a youngster. The 31-year-old escaped a civil war that took the lives of millions, having initially been sent to northern Sudan before leaving for Egypt and then obtaining refugee status in the US. Sarah and Ysra Mardini A dramatic tale of two young swimmers who needed all their skill in the water to survive the long passage out of Syria. Sarah and Ysra Mardini fled the Syrian conflict this autumn and reportedly had to swim and hang on to an inflatable dinghy from Turkey to Greece, having previously left Syria through Lebanon. Having journeyed through Austria to Germany, the sisters have been welcomed by a swimming club in Berlin near their refugee shelter. Fabrice Muamba Most people know the story of Fabrice Muamba, but not the whole story. Muamba collapsed on the pitch while playing for Bolton Wanderers at Tottenham during an FA Cup match in 2012, suffering a severe cardiac arrest when his heart stopped beating for 78 minutes. The former midfielder made a remarkable recovery, although retired from the game. Muamba grew up in Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and left for London with his mother as an 11-year-old, being reunited with his father after three years. Of his arrival at Heathrow, Muamba said: “It was 6 December 1999, and it was the kind of coldness I had never known. It was the first time I had seen snow. I was shivering when I got off the plane but it was worth it. We saw my father and we all ran up to each other and started hugging. It was the start of our new life.” Jimmy Thoronka Thoronka, a 100m sprinter from Sierra Leone, was found emaciated and homeless on the streets of London after absconding from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Although not an official refugee, Thoronka did not return home because of the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, where thousands have died from the disease. Eight of Thoronka’s relatives died, but in October this year the Home Office rejected the athlete’s application to remain in the UK. He had been training at the Heathside running club in north London and, although Thoronka was offered a sports scholarship by the University of East London, his application to stay in the country was rejected. Shefki Kuqi Kuqi, 39, was a striker who played for many clubs in England, including Sheffield Wednesday, Ipswich Town, Crystal Palace and Newcastle during a professional career where he became known as a dedicated and physical forward. He grew up in Kosovo, then Yugoslavia. In 1989, when Kuqi was 12, his family moved to Finland to escape the war between the Serbs and Kosovans, recalling: “Everybody was feeling sad and crying – it was like being at a funeral. I didn’t really understand what was happening; all I knew was that I was being asked to leave my home and all my friends.” Kuqi played for Finland 62 times. Victor Moses The Chelsea attacker, who is currently on loan at West Ham, was raised in Kaduna in Nigeria. His father was a Christian pastor in a country divided by religion, and both he and Moses’ mother were attacked in their home and killed when riots swept in 2002. Moses was told of the news when playing football in the street, before being sent to England where he was taken in by foster parents in south London. Moses, 25, has been capped 24 times by Nigeria. William Kopati Kopati is among a number of athletes sheltering in Mole refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He fled his home in the Central African Republic in 2013 when militants attacked his house. He was the national high jump champion in CAR and, despite his refugee status, says he will continue to pursue his dream: “My first dream is to continue with athletics. I love it so much but I had to abandon it because of the situation in my country”. Readers wishing to make a donation to the refugee appeal can give online here or call 0151 284 1126.

2015-09-01T12:53:04Z,Hungarian TV ‘told not to broadcast images of refugee children’,"Employees of Hungarian state television have been instructed not to include children in footage of news pieces about migrants and refugees, a leaked screenshot of editorial advice to journalists at news channel M1 reveals. Hungary’s government-appointed Media Authority, MTVA, denied state media outlets have been told to limit public sympathy towards refugees, arguing that the memo was designed to protect children, while a pro-government journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian this had only been one-off instruction. “They do show children sometimes: actually the percentage of children registered in Hungary this year is quite low, so in some opposition media they are somewhat overrepresented,” the source said. Hungary has become a major transit country for migrants and refugees in recent months, but while M1 was quick to broadcast footage showing demonstrations outside the overcrowded transit zone at Budapest’s Keleti station over the weekend, protests against government policies on refugees have received scant coverage in state media. Refugee solidarity group MigSzol has held mass protests against the Hungarian government’s “national consultation” on immigration and the construction of a fence along the country’s border with Serbia. However, the pro-government journalist argued that these protests have been overlooked because “MigSzol tends to campaign against some Hungarian and even EU laws regarding migration.” The civic aid initiatives that have sprung up in lieu of co-ordinated state help have also been largely ignored by state media. The journalist said: “The NGOs helping the migrants are very political: people known from the opposition scene take part and they mix pro-migration content with criticism of the government, so pro-government, more rightwing media won’t really give (a platform) for these people … even if their work to help migrants is okay.” Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party, led by the populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has faced accusations of encroaching on independent journalism since it passed a controversial media law soon after securing its first ever parliamentary majority in 2010. The law raised “serious doubts about the compatibility of the Hungarian legislation with Union law”, the EU media commissioner said at the time. This prompted a change of tack: Fidesz began to acquire outlets through business associates. Last year, it also introduced a progressive media advertising profit tax that seemingly targeted the country’s one remaining major independent television broadcaster, RTL. However, the plan backfired when RTL rescheduled its previously uncritical news programme to a primetime slot and recruited investigative journalists who had left independent media in protest at government interference. The European commission in March forbade Hungary from levying the tax, pending the outcome of an investigation. The Orbán government has also flexed its financial muscle in Hungary’s print media: in the 18 months up to June 2014 the rightwing newspapers Magyar Hírlap and Magyar Nemzet received state advertisement revenues of HUF 1.5bn – more than 10 times that received by the liberal Népszabadság and Socialist Népszava, despite their higher combined circulation. Last autumn, Orbán also touted the introduction of an internet tax, bringing 100,000 people on to the streets of Budapest to protest, after which the idea was put on ice, then scrapped, in another rare government u-turn. While state-media supported Fidesz communications have angered the international community, which has largely deemed the border fence a failure, at home the anti-migrant rhetoric has chimed with voters and helped the party shore up its falling support. While just 3% of Hungarians considered immigration a key issue in a poll at the end of 2014 – a year in which Hungary received over 40,000 asylum applications – the Republikon Institute this week found that 66% of the population believe that “the refugees pose a danger to Hungary and therefore they shouldn’t be allowed” into the country, and just 19% agreed that “it is the duty of Hungary to accept migrants”. “The media law provides for government control of the public channels and the private channels are heavily influenced by politics,” said Tom Popper, editor of the Budapest Business Journal. “The government’s biggest concerns are about Hungarian-language media,” he added."
2015-09-22T15:41:56Z,Theresa May maintains tough stance on 'economic migrants',"The UK home secretary has called for Europe to “get on with the job” of breaking the link between “economic migrants” making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean and settling in Europe. Arriving at the extraordinary European Union interior ministers refugee crisis meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, Theresa May confirmed that Britain would not be taking part in a further EU programme to relocate 120,000 refugees from Italy, Greece and Hungary. Interior ministers were hoping to find a way of settling the highly controversial distribution of the 120,000 across Europe during Tuesday’s meeting. Instead, the home secretary said Britain would only take people direct from Syrian refugee camps in the Middle East and emphasised the need for wider European measures to “return those people who are illegally economic migrants and who have no right to be here”. She made clear that she saw Britain’s role, at the crunch meeting being held on the eve of a refugee crisis summit of European prime ministers, as being to push for rigorous processing of those who have made it to Europe. “We must ensure that people arriving at Europe’s borders are being properly dealt with, properly fingerprinted so that decisions can be made and when they are illegal economic migrants, they can be returned,” May said. Britain, which under the Lisbon Treaty can opt out of the EU refugee relocation programme, is the only member state that will not participate in some form or other. Both Ireland and Denmark, which also have opt-outs, have said they will nevertheless take some of the refugees from within Europe. The home secretary said: “The UK will not be participating in the relocation scheme. We have announced that we will be taking more refugees direct from the Syrian refugee camps – we will be resettling those people in the UK over the next few years. “That means we can help the most vulnerable people. It also means that fewer people will be trying to make that dangerous journey through into Europe which has sadly seen so many lives lost. We also need Europe to get on with the job of wider measures that need to be taken of ensuring that we are breaking the link for economic migrants between making this dangerous journey and settling in Europe.” May’s remarks came as the International Organisation of Migration said that 473,887 men, women and children had arrived in Europe by sea so far in 2015. It added that at least 182,000, or just under 40% of them, were Syrians. The British Refugee Council said the home secretary’s comments were “extremely disappointing”, adding that: “Britain can’t leave refugees to camp on Greek beaches. We must help protect refugees.” The council said May’s emphasis on breaking the link between making it to Europe and settling in the continent “ignores the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ assessment that 84% of arrivals are from world’s top 10 refugee-producing countries”."
2015-12-01T13:18:41Z,#GivingTuesday: an appeal to help alleviate the global refugee crisis,"The Guardian has reported relentlessly about the plight of refugees – from Syria itself, and the countries to which so many have fled; to the European countries that have welcomed refugees with varying degrees of warmth; and from here in the US, where debates have raged about how America should respond to this and so many other immigration crises. These devastating stories of migration and the toll on human lives around the world have amounted to one of the defining issues of 2015. At the end of this year, we feel it is important to stand with those people who so desperately need help. Guardian US is supporting #GivingTuesday and today we are donating our advertising space to six charities working to help people fleeing conflicts in their home countries. All of our display advertising this Tuesday will encourage our readers to donate to help alleviate the global refugee crisis. There are currently around 60 million people seeking sanctuary from oppression and conflict across the globe, many of whom have fled the ongoing war in Syria. The plight of refugees can often seem far removed from our daily lives, and geographic, cultural and language differences mean all too often we overlook those in need. But, as Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner wrote about the Guardian’s global charity appeal for refugees: “It is vital we do not close our hearts, or lose sight of the essential human response, or ignore the needs of some of the world’s most desperate people.” Alongside our Guardian colleagues in the UK and Australia we have chosen to support refugees through this holiday appeal not just to raise money for a vital humanitarian cause but as an act of solidarity. We are standing for empathy and generosity across the globe. In the US we have chosen six charities to receive advertising space on our site. Our aim is to highlight the important work they are doing and to encourage our readers to donate to those in need. Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, works around the world to provide refugees and internally displaced people with everything they need, from psychological care to lifesaving nutrition; setting up hospitals in refugee camps; helping women give birth safely; vaccinating children; and providing access to safe drinking water. The International Rescue Committee responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic well-being and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster. IRC teams provide healthcare, infrastructure, learning and economic support to people in more than 40 countries, with special programs designed for women and children. The IRC resettle thousands of refugees in 26 cities across the US each year. Since 2014 alone, Migrant Offshore Aid Station has pulled 12,000 refugees to safety from rickety boats in the Mediterranean Sea. But thousands have drowned on migrant routes. Our campaign will help this inspirational charity expand its search and rescue work in seas off Greece and Turkey, and in south-east Asia. Half of the world’s refugees are children, growing up far from home without consistent education, safety or emotional support. Mercy Corps works to provide those basic needs, providing food, water, language skills and emergency relief. In Lebanon and Jordan, Oxfam America is helping families get the essential supplies they need, while protecting public health with clean water and safe sanitation. In war-torn Syria, the charity is supporting repairs to damaged water networks and helping keep clean water flowing to hundreds of thousands of people. Refugees International has fought to ensure that humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and lifesaving medical care, is available to those displaced both inside and outside Syria. The charity has also spent months in neighboring countries hosting millions of Syrians, and documented the types of assistance needed so as to forcefully argue for more support from the international community. We hope our efforts on #GivingTuesday will encourage people to donate generously to those who are working tirelessly to alleviate suffering."
2015-09-17T16:00:18Z,Clashes at border with Serbia as Croatia says it cannot take more refugees – as it happened,"Hundreds of people broke through police lines at two border crossing between Serbia and Croatia. Police at Tovarnik tried to stop people marching on the tracks towards Zagreb resulting in a stampede, which saw a number of people faint and one man suffer a heart attack. It was unclear whether the man survived.. Croatia’s Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said his country cannot accept any more people after 7,300 people crossed the border in the last two days. Croatia’s President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic asked the army to be ready, if necessary, to protect its borders. Calm has returned to Hungary’s border with Serbia a day after Hungarian police used teargas and water cannon to stop people crossing the sealed frontier. Serbia put on buses to help refugees to reach the Croatia border. Criticism of yesterday’s actions by Hungarian police have continued with UN’s human rights commission chief Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein describing it as callous and using disproportionate force, motivated by xenophobia and anti-Muslim views. The EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos also chastised Hungary, suggesting it was on the wrong side of history. Hungary has vowed to continue to forcefully defend its border and rejected criticism of its use of water cannon and teargas against refugees. The Hungarian foreign minister will visit Serbia on Friday. Hungary has accused Serbia of failing to stop refugees “attacking” Hungarian police, while Serbia has said it is “not right” for Hungary to fire water cannon and teargas over its border. The UN’s secretary general Ban Ki-moon condemned Hungary. “I was shocked to see how these refugees and migrants were treated. It’s not acceptable,” Ban told a news conference. Slovenia has become the latest European country to reintroduce border controls. It informed the European Commission that from today its border with Hungary will be closed for at least 10 days. The country’s Red Cross said it expects 5,000 refugees to arrive in coming days, as thousands have poured into neighbouring Croatia. Concerns are mounting about refugees straying into minefields in their search for ways round border restrictions in Balkans. Tovarnik station, where thousands of refugees are gathering, is about 12km away from a minefield left over the Croatian war. Germany’s federal police reported 7,266 “unpermitted border crossings” in 24 hours on Wednesday, twice as many as the day before. The police also counted an additional 4,600 refugees waiting to be allowed into Germany on the Austrian side of the border. Dozens of Syrian refugees stranded in Istanbul’s main bus garage for the last two days, and denied travel to join other Syrian refugees in Edrine near the Greek borders by have started a hunger strike today to persuade Turkish police to allow them to take buses there. Muhammed Jamal, 26, a Syrian refugee, from Homs said: strike said: After the tragic death of the Syrian child, Aylan who was drowned with his brother in the sea, we reckoned to mobilise Syrian refugees in Turkey who want to seek refuge and settlement in Europe. They do not want to risk their lives and travel by sea or pay fortunes to smugglers, so we have decided to camp in Edrine city by the Greek borders to be allowed to get to Greece safely by buses. We launched this new campaign out of our despair and frustration. We can’t stay in Turkey all our life without any financial, medical and housing support. It has become too difficult to rent a room if you are a Syrian refugee or find any chance of work. I’m spending most of my time in the street. Some Syrian refugees were actually able to get to Edrine but they were kicked out by the Turkish police. We want the whole world to hear our voice that we demand the Greece authorities open their land borders with Turkey and let us continue to Europe. We resolved to go on hunger strike to put more pressure on Turkish police to allow us to take buses to Edrine. We have been stuck in the garage for two days now. However, we are determined to keep going as we do not have any other choice. Croatia’s President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic asked the army on Thursday to be ready, if necessary, to protect its borders, the state news agency Hina reported. Croatia’s president met the army chief of staff and required a higher level of alert and the army and to be ready, if need be, to protect the national borders Croatia’s Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic has said his country cannot accept any more people after more than 7,000 people crossed the border in the last two days. Slovenia’s Red Cross expects 5,000 refugees to enter the country in the coming days as thousands have been pouring into neighbouring Croatia, AP reports: The organisation appealed Thursday for more aid saying “we will need help from Slovenia and everyone who understands the human suffering of the people fleeing war-ravaged areas.” More than 7,300 people have entered Croatia in the last two days. Most migrants have sought to move on toward Western Europe, with Slovenia being the next stop on their route. The Serbian foreign ministry has just announced that the Hungarian foreign minister will visit Serbia on Friday. The two countries have been embroiled in a war of words after Hungary, which has sealed its southern border with Serbia, yesterday fired teargas and water cannon over the border at crowds of refugees. Hungary demanded that Serbia stop the people gathered at its border from “attacking” its police officers while Serbia said Hungary had “no right” to fire into its territory. Here are some more pictures from the Tovarnik stampede: The criticism of Hungary from UN agencies continues to pour in, this time from the UN’s human rights commission chief, whose condemnation is some of the strongest to date. A statement from the Geneva-based agency said: High Commissioner Zeid (Ra’ad al Hussein) deplored the xenophobic and anti-Muslim views that appear to lie at the heart of current Hungarian government policy. Zeid also said images of women and children being assaulted with tear gas and water cannon at Hungary’s frontier with Serbia were “truly shocking”. I am appalled at the callous, and in some cases illegal, actions of the Hungarian authorities in recent days, which include denying entry to, arresting, summarily rejecting and returning refugees, using disproportionate force on migrants and refugees, as well as reportedly assaulting journalists and seizing video documentation. Interior minister Thomas de Maizière is planning huge cuts to Germany’s benefits for asylum seekers in a new fast-tracked bill, a copy of which was leaked to the news agency AFP on Thursday. The draft bill, dated Monday, would see refugees who have travelled to Germany via other EU countries - and should therefore be under their jurisdiction, according to the Dublin rules - refused the automatic benefits allowed under Germany’s asylum seeker law. They will only be given a travel ticket and provisions, the agency said. In addition, refugees who cannot be deported because they don’t have passports and refuse to give information on their country of origin will be refused the right to work and will lose social benefits. Any asylum seekers on Germany’s list of “safe countries of origin” - chiefly Balkan countries - would also be barred from work and from any education or training schemes. The asylum seekers’ campaign group Pro Asyl criticized the plan heavily. “The government’s draft law will make partition, deterrence, and homelessness all part of the programme,” the group said in a statement released on its website. These are the latest tweets from AFP’s Eric Randolph: AJ+ is periscoping from Tovarnik. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: Croatia’s Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said his country cannot accept any more people after more than 7,000 people crossed the border in the last two days. Thousands of people have gathered at Tovarnik station in the hope of getting to the Croatia capital Zagreb. Extra buses have been unable to cope with the numbers. Hundreds of people broke through police lines at two border crossing between Serbia and Croatia. Croatia said it forced back 500 people marching on the tracks towards Zagreb. Calm has returned to Hungary’s border with Serbia a day after Hungarian police used teargas and water cannon to stop people crossing the sealed frontier. Serbia put on buses to help refugees to reach the Croatia border. Hungary has vowed to continue to forcefully defend its border and rejected criticism of its use of water cannon and teargas against refugees. The EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos chastised Hungary suggesting it was on the wrong side of history. The UN’s secretary general Ban Ki-moon condemned Hungary. “I was shocked to see how these refugees and migrants were treated. It’s not acceptable,” Ban told a news conference. Slovenia has become the latest European country to reintroduce border controls. It informed the European Commission that from today its border with Hungary will be closed for at least 10 days. Concerns are mounting about refugees straying into minefields in their search for ways round border restrictions in Balkans. Tovarnik station, where thousands of refugees are gathering, is about 12km away from a minefield left over the Croatian war. Germany’s federal police reported 7,266 “unpermitted border crossings” in 24 hours on Wednesday, twice as many as the day before. The police also counted an additional 4,600 refugees waiting to be allowed into Germany on the Austrian side of the border. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, has summoned EU leaders to an extraordinary summit on Wednesday to discuss migration and a proposed scheme to redistribute 120,000 asylum seekers across the 28-nation bloc. Tusk said in a tweet on Thursday that he had convened a summit on Wednesday from 6pm CET (5pm GMT) to deal with the refugee crisis. Ministers are due to revisit the mandatory relocation plan, which EU interior ministers failed to agree on Monday, at an emergency meeting on Tuesday after the European Parliament endorsed it on Thursday, with diplomats keen to avoid a new failure. Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Poland, all former communist countries that joined the EU a decade ago, are the main opponents of compulsory quotas, arguing that they would draw more migrants to Europe and disrupt their societies, which are not accustomed to large-scale immigration. Sky News is reporting that things are now calmer in Tovarnik, Croatia, where refugees clashed with police stationed at the border with Serbia. Sky’s correspondent said: “Everyone has gone through.” Croatia’s Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic appears to be rowing back on Croatia’s pledge to grant refugees free passage through Croatia. He said anyone not seeking asylum there would be considered an illegal migrant. He said his country cannot accept any more people. In the last couple of days some 7,300 have arrived in Croatia. That is almost three times the amount that arrived in the whole of last year. Refugees have also broken through police lines in the Croatia border town of Batina. Footage from Sky News showed hundreds of people overwhelming police numbers to cross the border from the Serbia to Croatia. Live footage from Tovarnik shows refugees clashing with Croatian police after scores of people broke through police lines. There are reports of some people collapsing in the rush. Croatia’s interior ministry has confirmed that refugees were stopped by police from walking along the railway tracks, after a group of around 500 people started to march towards Zagreb from the crowded Tovarnik station. Extra buses have been put on to take people to the capital, it said. Fights have broken out at the scene. There are reports of a standoff between Croatian police and refugees stranded at Croatia’s Tovarnik rail station as the Croatian government said it was struggling to cope with the numbers. Less than a day after frustrated refugees clashed with Hungarian police on the Serbo-Hungarian border, the scene here at Horgoš is almost back to normal, writes Patrick Kingsley. Serbian officials are in the final stages of bussing people towards the Croatian border to the west – raising questions about why they did not do so sooner, instead of letting people stew at the gates of Hungary. A group of young Kurdish students are among the last few still waiting for a bus at Horgoš. They say they’re taking a punt – Croatia, despite welcoming words from its politicians, is an unknown. “We just have to have faith,” said Nowar Daoud, a 23-year-old archaeology student from Hasaka. “We’ll go and find out what’s happening. Maybe we can cross, maybe we can’t. We live in hope.” But as in every conversation on this refugee route, Daoud and his friends say that ultimately nothing will stop people fleeing from war. Hamas Shekhmous, an 18-year-old high school student travelling with her two brothers, said: “We’re not afraid of anything because after Daesh” – the Arab slang term for Islamic State – “nothing scares us.” But a smattering of people are a little more circumspect. Kawa, a 30-year-old agricultural engineer from north-eastern Syria, reckoned it was better to wait it out at the Hungarian border until he got word that the Croatian route works. “After Croatia is Slovenia,” Kawa said. “And we don’t know what Slovenia will do.” The former England football captain Sir Bobby Charlton and founder of the landmine research charity Find A Better Way, has added his voice to concerns about refugees straying into minefields in their search for ways round border restrictions in Balkans. In a statement Charlton said: I was very concerned to hear the news about the danger for migrants crossing the Croatian border. From my recent visit to Croatia and the Croatian Mine Action Center I am only too aware of the very real danger and threat that landmines pose across the country, particularly at its borders. CROMAC estimates that Croatia is contaminated with over 50,000 mines left from conflict, across a large suspected area of 195.3 square miles. It is incredibly harrowing that innocent migrants and refugees who are fleeing conflict now face imminent threats from these weapons of war at Croatia’s borders. Find A Better Way funds the research to improve detection methods to find landmines. Thousands of migrants are gathering in Tovarnik railway station only a few kilometres from the nearest minefield left over from the war in Croatia in the 1990s (see earlier). Slovenia has become the latest European country to reintroduce border controls. It informed the European Commission that from today its border with Hungary will be closed for at least 10 days. The Commission said the move did not flout the Schengen agreement as the controls were introduce due to the “serious threat to public policy or internal security”. The current situation in Slovenia, prima facie, appears to be a situation covered by the rules. The measures taken by Slovenia today, like those taken by Germany on 13 September and Austria on 15 September, are temporary in nature. The situation serves to further underscore the pressing need to agree on and quickly implement the measures proposed by the European Commission in order to manage the refugee crisis. Earlier today the European Parliament backed a binding quota system for resettling 120,000 refugee. The move will put pressure on support on the Justice and Home Affairs Council which failed to agree on the proposals at a meeting of European interior ministers on Monday. French authorities have evicted more than 600 refugees and migrants who had been sleeping rough in two camps of tents near Paris’s Austerlitz station and the town-hall of the 18th arrondissement, writes Angelique Chrisafis in Paris. The evictions by plain clothes police took place before dawn when people were put on coaches with reassurances of temporary accommodation in centres in and around Paris. Hundreds of people, including from Sudan and Eritrea, had been sleeping rough in Paris for months following the clearing of tents near La Chapelle earlier this summer. But hundreds more people are still sheltering in fetid and insanitary conditions in a four-storey abandoned high-school building in the north of the city, the Lycée Jean-Quarré, where health problems such as diarrhea and scabies are rife. Tension continues to rise at Tovarnik railway station at Croatia’s border with Serbia, according to reporters at the scene. Associated Press reporters at the scene say migrants have become restless, demanding to move on. Croatian authorities have been distributing food and water as they cope with the migrant wave entering the country over the Serbian border. Frustrated refugees waiting for trains at Tovarnik are threatening to walk along the tracks to get to the Croatian capital Zagreb, according to the BBC’s Fergal Keane. Thousands of refugees are gathering about 12km away from a minefield left over from the Croatian war, according to maps circulated by anti-landmine campaigners. Tovarnik station is close to an area to the west, marked in red on the map, which is known to contain mines from the conflict. There is also another minefield close to Croatia border with Serbia. Earlier the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said the danger of mines near the border area worsened an already precarious situation facing refugees. In an email to the Guardian its director Megan Burke said: “We are very concerned about the situation of Syrian refugees and the many risks that they face as they try to find a secure place where they can be. Landmines in Croatia are of course a very big risk and yet another reminder as to why landmines have been banned.” She highlighted maps showing the danger areas that refugees should avoid. Regional refugee groups in Serbia have been disseminating maps to refugees, she said. Burke warned refugees to avoid straying from main routes. She said: For refugees themselves, simple information such as the importance of staying on main roads and official border crossing roads and what to look out for regarding mine warning signs will be helpful for people who really don’t know the areas at all, even more perhaps than trying to navigate around the possibly dangerous places. Croatia has had a responsibility to mark all known mined areas under their obligations to the Mine Ban Treaty. The Croatian Mine Action Centre has sent deminers to border areas where there might be a risk. Hungary claims its police used forced at the border on Wednesday after being attacked by a mob directed by a “terrorist”. AP reports. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said Thursday that the unidentified Syrian man was “one of the organizers who specifically directed the attacks” . Police detained 22 people who managed to break through, including the man who Kovacs said was suspected of “carrying out of an act of terrorism.” The migrants were repelled with tear gas and water cannons and police used batons to drive back those trying to enter Hungary. Rightwing lawmakers in the northern Italian region of Lombardy are cracking down on hotel owners who have hosted migrants, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner. The move is the latest effort by the Northern League to discourage asylum-seekers from settling there. Lombardy’s regional council passed an amendment on Wednesday (41-29) that would bar any hotel that has voluntarily hosted migrants over the last three years from receiving regional funds or participating in local tenders. The measure was seen as a compromise after the Northern League, the rightwing party headed by Matteo Salvini, initially proposed that the hotels ought to be fined between 5,000 to 10,000 euros and see their licenses suspended for six months to a year. Germany’s federal police reported 7,266 “unpermitted border crossings” in 24 hours on Wednesday, twice as many as the day before, with most coming across the Austrian border, writes Ben Knight in Berlin. The police also counted an additional 4,600 refugees waiting to be allowed into Germany on the Austrian side of the border. There have been long tailbacks on roads between Germany and Austria as commuters are being held up at the new border controls. Refugees, meanwhile, are being filtered out, made to wait, and only let across into Germany in small groups. The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that two groups of 700 refugees each were being held at a border bridge over the river Saalach, near the German town of Freilassing, waiting to be registered at collection points and then distributed throughout Germany. Der Spiegel’s foreign affairs editor Raniah Salloum pointed out that reintroduced border controls appear fairly lax. The German police also said it had arrested 18 suspected refugee traffickers in the past 24 hours, while Bavarian state premier Horst Seehofer has claimed that the German border controls have led to the capture of dozens of traffickers. He told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that 800 suspects were already in Bavarian custody. Germany also strengthened controls on its borders with the Czech Republic on Wednesday and Thursday, where four suspected traffickers had been arrested since Wednesday, police said. In a separate development, the head of Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) Manfred Schmidt handed in his resignation on Thursday “for personal reasons”. The BAMF has been criticised in recent weeks for failing to keep up with the huge rise in asylum applications. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, himself under increasing pressure for his handling of the crisis, said he regretted Schmidt’s decision. Croatia’s Tovarnik station has become the latest hotspot in Europe’s escalating refugee crisis. Thousands of people have gathered there in the hope of reaching western Europe via Zagreb. Local authorities in Tovarnik, have appealed for government help, according to AP. Hungary has vowed to continue to forcefully defend its border and rejected criticism of its use of water cannon and teargas against refugees. Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, said its razor wire fence was protecting EU borders against illegal immigration and that other countries should put up similar barriers and be prepared to defend them. Speaking at press conference he said: “Hungary is not going to just let people go through its territory and that’s what we’ve achieved. If everybody took care of their external borders, all European member states, especially those who have a Schengen border, the situation would be very different. That’s why we are calling for the Greek seas to be protected, if not by Greece, then by a joint European force that is able to stop illegal migration.” Kovacs added: “We don’t like the fence. But it seems to be working to protect the country’s borders, to stop illegal migration. Obviously we are going to continue with that - keeping the fence, protecting the fence by police. We can’t understand those messages that are coming from some European countries. Schengen’s freedoms cannot be protected from within [the European Union] it should be protected from the outside. That’s what we will do - to reinforce the external protection of European borders.” The number of people arriving in Croatia has climbed to 6,200, according to Croatia’s interior ministry, as more make the trek from the sealed Hungarian border. Three international journalists were among those beaten by the Hungarian police at the border on Wednesday, according to reports in the Hungarian media. Induxhu journalist Szabolcs Panyi names two of the journalist as an Australian citizen Warren Richardson and Polish reporter Jacek Tacik. The aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières said at least one person was treated with plastic bullet wounds after Hungarian police used force to repel refugees at Hungary’s border with Serbia. It said MSF teams in Horgos, on the Serbian side of the border, treated one plastic bullet wound, 12 wounds caused by trying to scale the razor fence, and around 15 patients with eyes affected by tear gas. It said most of the people who had gathered at the Horgos border point have now left, but up to 1,000 remain. Aurelie Ponthieu, MSF’s advisor on displacement, said: “Using such excessive force against vulnerable people to prevent them from seeking safety is a disgrace and utterly shameful.” The Guardian’s community team is looking for help from readers: Calais Action, which began delivering donations to refugees in Calais in August, has been charting community efforts in support of refugees in the UK and Europe. It has produced a crowdsourced map of activities so far. With your help we’d like to build on this great mapping effort by documenting the spread of grassroots activity and help people discover what’s happening where they are. We’d also like to understand the spread of community activity and response from the public. If you are organising an event, demonstration, collection of donations, drop-off of supplies or another activity in support of the refugees, let us know by adding it here. The EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos has chastised Hungary for its response to the refugee crisis. On a visit to Hungary Avramopoulos suggested Hungary was on the wrong side of history. He said: Walls are temporary solutions. You have seen yourself that this only serves to divert flows or escalate tensions. Violence is not the solution either. The majority of people arriving in Europe are Syrians. They are people in genuine need of our protection. There is no wall you would not climb, no sea you would not cross if you are fleeing violence and terror. I believe we have a moral duty offer them protection. It is a duty inscribed in international and European laws. It is a duty grounded in our principles. For me personally this is also a Christian duty. The appeal I would make to you is to continue to work with us, with the European Union, to find common and lasting solutions. Let me be frank with you, this is not a problem that is going to go away any time soon. Let’s make sure we are on the right side of history. Turkish authorities have announced that hundreds of refugees who have set up camp on a main road at Edirne near the Greek border will be forcibly removed in three days if they refuse to leave. Many others are holding out at Istanbul’s main bus station in the hope of reaching northern Europe by land rather than risk the perilous sea journey. Bus services from the main terminal in Istanbul to cities on the Greek and Bulgarian borders were suspended last week, prompting several hundred refugees, most of them Syrians, to take to the road in an attempt to reach the European Union on foot. Danish prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has offered to take another 1,000 refugees, writes Alberto Nardelli. Rasmussen also offered to provide 750m krone inadditional funding over the next two years. However, Denmark’s government said it maintains its right to opt out from the quota system proposed by the European Commission, which aims to relocate 120,000 refugees from Greece, Italy and Hungary on top of the previously proposed 40,000 from Greece and Italy. Denmark is allowed to opt out from the plans along with Ireland and Britain. With Ireland expected to opt in, Britain would - de facto - remain the only EU member state not receiving refugees from within Europe in one way or the other. Instead, David Cameron has said that Britain will welcome 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps on the borders of Syria over the next five years. Meanwhile the US announced earlier this week that it will accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year. Rail services between Austria and Hungary will resume in both directions on Friday, Austrian rail company OeBB has announced. The link was suspended for a week to reduce the flow of migrants into the country from Hungary. Labour’s new leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would back the imposition of European quotas for the resettlement of refugees. In an interview for Channel 4 News Corbyn said it was a “great mistake” of the UK government to opt out of the European refugee programme. “We should take our share,” Corbyn said. Campaigners against land mines have expressed concern about refugees straying onto minefields left over from the 1990s war in Croatia. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said the danger of mines near the border area worsened an already precarious situation facing refugees. In an email to the Guardian its director Megan Burke said: “We are very concerned about the situation of Syrian refugees and the many risks that they face as they try to find a secure place where they can be. Landmines in Croatia are of course a very big risk and yet another reminder as to why landmines have been banned.” She highlighted maps showing the danger areas that refugees should avoid. Regional refugee groups in Serbia have been disseminating maps to refugees, she said. Burke warned refugees to avoid straying from main routes. She said: For refugees themselves, simple information such as the importance of staying on main roads and official border crossing roads and what to look out for regarding mine warning signs will be helpful for people who really don’t know the areas at all, even more perhaps than trying to navigate around the possibly dangerous places. Croatia has had a responsibility to mark all known mined areas under their obligations to the Mine Ban Treaty. The Croatian Mine Action Centre has sent deminers to border areas where there might be a risk. The UN’s refugee agency has ramped up its criticism of Hungary claiming its restrictions on asylum seekers flout international law and worsen an “already chaotic situation worse”. In a statement it also condemned Hungary’s use of force at its border. It said: UNHCR was especially shocked and saddened to witness Syrian refugees, including families with children who have already suffered so much, being prevented from entering the EU with water cannons and tear gas. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, added: “UNHCR reiterates its call on the the Hungarian authorities to ensure unimpeded access for people in need of protection in line with its legal and moral obligations. States should manage their borders in a way that is consistent with International and EU Law, including guaranteeing the right to seek asylum. “It is not a crime to cross a border to seek asylum.” The scene of yesterday’s chaotic scenes, is reported to be calm this morning. Croatia’ interior ministry confirmed that 5,650 migrants have entered the country since Hungary imposed tough new border restrictions. It also said a special train service was put on to take migrants to a reception centre. AFP’s Eric Randolph reports chaotic scenes at Tovarnik railway station. Meanwhile Hungary continues to report a sharp fall in the number of newcomers. On Monday more than 9,000 migrants entered Hungary. But since new laws were introduced on Tuesday only a few hundred have made it through, according to the latest figures from the Hungarian Police. On Wednesday only 277 migrants were recorded. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the refugee crisis as Hungary faces widespread condemnation for firing teargas and water cannon at people trying to cross its border. Here’s a rundown of the latest developments. Thousands of migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia in the past 24 hours after Hungary sealed its border, national state-run HRT television reported. Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic said that the country was prepared for the arrival of migrants but could not cope if the numbers increased dramatically. The Croatian Red Cross said 5,400 people had arrived. The UN’s secretary general Ban Ki-moon has sharply condemned Hungary for using force against refugees. “I was shocked to see how these refugees and migrants were treated. It’s not acceptable,” Ban told a news conference. The number of refugees who entered Germany on Wednesday more than doubled to 7266. “Most of them were picked up when crossing the German-Austrian border” a spokeswoman said. Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann is holding crisis talks with his central European counterparts. In Zagreb he met Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic who has vowed that his country would allow free passage of migrants across its territory. Later he is due to meet Slovenian premier Miro Cerar who has taken a tougher line on immigration. A Syrian whose request for asylum in Hungary was rejected within minutes raising questions about Hungary’s commitment to protecting refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. Zahir Habbal, a 29-year-old Syrian electrician, was one of the first refugees to try to navigate Hungary’s asylum system after the closure of the country’s southern border, and the prosecution of anyone trying to cross it through unofficial routes. The Syrian refugee who was tripped by a Hungarian camera operator has been offered the chance to restart his career as football coach by Spanish football academy. Osama Abdul Mohsen arrived in Spain last night."
2015-12-23T11:31:20Z,The committed medical students sacrificing their time for refugees,"Students in the UK have been instrumental in organising aid collections and showing support for refugees since this summer, spurred on by heightened media coverage of the crisis that has gripped Europe. Since then, the number of people taking refuge in the Calais jungle has risen to more than 6,000, most fleeing conflict, violence and poverty in countries including Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Kosovo. The camp’s poor hygiene and ramshackle living conditions are a breeding ground for health problems. These include respiratory infections from the cold, infected cuts from barbed wire, scabies from living in overcrowded tents, eye problems from exposure to tear gas, fractures and sprains from falls related to the migratory journey and post-traumatic stress and psychological disorders. Many of the UK’s medical students have stepped up to help however they can, with some even making the journey to Calais. Here’s how they’re getting involved:Providing medical assistance in Calais Anyone trained in first aid is useful at the camp, where medical provision is patchy and relatively scarce. Hannah Vandersluis, 21, a third-year medical student at Cambridge, volunteered in Calais earlier this month with the Cambridge University Calais Refugee Action Group (CUCRAG), and spent an afternoon working with a doctor in a medical caravan. As a pre-clinical student, she was unable to provide full medical care to refugees, but could offer first aid and give out paracetamol for headaches, ibuprofen for musculoskeletal pain or inflammation and lozenges for sore throats. The rules about how involved medical students can be in treating people in Calais are unclear and medical courses in the UK structure their clinical teaching differently, so some students are capable of doing more earlier than others. Medical students wanting to volunteer should seek advice from the British Medical Association, the Medical Protection Society or the Medical Defence Union before heading out to France. Vandersluis recommends that future medical students bring their hospital ID if they have one, or a letter from their university confirming they are a medical student. At the moment, there is no one in charge of the camp, and so no one to confirm that medical volunteers are actually medically trained “I didn’t have a lanyard with an ID card saying ‘medical student’ like I would in the UK,” says Vandersluis. “But then again, neither did the doctor I was working with.” Lots of injuries happen at night, such as those resulting from violence and scaling fences, when there is a particular shortage of first aid and medical care available. Vandersluis says there was limited help she could offer in such cases. “We cleaned, dressed and re-dressed wounds like these, but those we suspected of being infected we advised to go to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).” “The doctor I was working with said when she got back to where she was staying the previous night she just cried and cried because of how helpless she felt after a day largely consisting of giving paracetamol,” says Vandersluis. “There’s something very depressing about being capable of providing quality medical care while totally lacking the resources and infrastructure to do so.” Memories of her experience continue to worry Vandersluis. She recalls meeting a nine- or 10-year-old boy with no family – his dad is likely to have died on the journey – and an arm that had been broken by riot police. “I still think about him and hope that he’s safe with the people who’ve taken him in.” Fundraising and engagement on campus New ways for students to help refugees are being developed closer to home, and fundraising is easier than ever. Harriet Hubbard, 24, is a medical student at the University of Southampton considering a career in humanitarian medicine. Frustrated with the media’s coverage of the crisis this summer, she joined Calais Refugee Solidarity Bristol to help coordinate donated funds and got in touch with Doctors of the World (DOTW), a humanitarian medical charity that cares for migrants and refugees, the only long-term medical facility on the ground in Calais, and one of the Guardian’s chosen charities for its 2015 fundraising appeal. Hubbard joined DOTW on a visit to Calais in September and was moved by what she saw. “It was really traumatic – I only processed what I’d seen when I got home,” she says. “I’ve been to a Nairobi slum and it was like someone had cut out a bit from the slum and put it in Calais.” DOTW has recently stepped up its engagement with students, launching a new programme at Southampton last month with Hubbard’s help. In Residence is a formal platform through which students can fundraise for refugees, raise awareness of the issue, get more deeply involved in the charity’s work, or even set up their own DOTW health project. The charity hopes to launch at more universities with medical schools in 2016. In the UK, 30% of the charity’s volunteers are already students. Most of whom study at King’s College London, University College London, Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Tom McKenzie, business development and innovation manager at DOTW UK, says: “We’ve seen a huge increase in interest from students organising events at their university who would like a Doctors of the World representative to attend or just simply wanting to fundraise.” Doctors Without Borders, aka Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has a similar programme called Friends of MSF, through which students all over the UK have fundraised for refugees and organised speaking events, debates and discussions on migration. Volunteering at UK-based clinics Students have also been putting in the hours in admin roles to assist vulnerable people affected by the refugee crisis who have made it to the UK. DOTW relies on students’ help in its volunteer-led clinic in Bethnal Green. It has an open door policy, welcoming everyone regardless of their immigration status and putting patients in touch with medical services such as GP practices. Volunteers often come into contact with people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, which have been untreated because they don’t have access to a GP. Belinda Chihota, 22, a master’s student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, volunteers with DOTW at both its Bethnal Green clinic and as a caseworker at its head office. She helps people to register with GPs, addresses difficulties they are facing with NHS services, and books people’s appointments with the charity’s volunteer clinicians. Chihota says she has been humbled by her experience: “As a student one can easily become engrossed by the medicalisation of individuals, but I have always urged myself to remember that patients are people with genuine non-medical problems.” Vandersluis came away with mixed feelings after her experience in Calais. “It was equally despairing and rewarding. It was despairing because these people need and deserve so much more in terms of medical care, which clearly as a medical student I am unable to provide.” But she is comforted by the fact that at least had something to offer and would encourage all students to volunteer in whatever capacity they can – be it in a warehouse or medical care. Neither of which are taken for granted. This article was amended on 23 December to correct a factual error.

2015-12-27T19:03:39Z,"Jesus’s mother was a refugee, but was she a virgin? | Letters","Many reject the doctrine of the virginal conception of Jesus because, like other miracles in the gospels, it challenges scientific understanding. Others, like Giles Fraser, fear that it devalues sexual intimacy and stereotypes women (The virgin birth runs against the grain of Christianity, 24 December). Nobody can deny that belief in Mary’s virginity has sometimes been used to reinforce Christian neuroses about sex and women. But the real point is that in the singularity of this event God was launching a new departure in the history of humanity. This is a child like no other, born to a special woman in a special way, marking the beginning of something remarkably new and – in a world of injustice and oppression, as well as in the mess of individual lives– we all need new beginnings. Duncan Macpherson Hampton, Middlesex • Giles Fraser’s columns are always good and frequently brilliant. But the linking of “virginity” to purity – and the impurity of sex – is a Greek idea, not a Jewish one, and linked to the low status of (Greek) married women. The Jewish idea is related, but fundamentally different. It was unfaithfulness that was impure, emphatically not the sex, which was the expression of the Creation covenant: “the twain shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). This is abundantly clear in the Prophets, where the “virgin daughter of Zion” (see Jeremiah 31:4,13,21 for a characteristic example) is the standard figure for the faithful remnant of the people that has resisted idolatry. Fraser’s error reflects the Platonist syncretism that has misled the church since the (mythical) donation of Constantine. Chris Jeynes Guildford, Surrey • Giles Fraser, as a 1970s liberal Anglican, gets confused in seeking to repudiate the scriptural account of the origin of Jesus Christ. Jesus was not subject to a virgin birth (ie he did not emerge from the birth canal leaving the hymen intact); he was born, as a response to original sin, by pneumatologically generated virginal conception – thereby repudiating the debased and disordered male sexuality Fraser is so proud of. The gnostic accounts Fraser cites are antisemitic and merely reiterate the fall into sin. Paul Brazier London • Far from being part of a hostile polemic against Jesus, “we have not been born of fornication” is a plaintive defence by “Jews who believed him” put on the back foot by Jesus’s aggressive accusation that neither Abraham nor God is their father (John 8). He ends up telling them that their father is in fact the Devil, a murderer and a liar and the father of lies (8.44). The unpleasant point of this unpleasant harangue is that John’s Jesus casts “the Jews” as bastard children of the Devil: it has nothing to do with the legitimacy or otherwise of Jesus’s own conception. Peter McKenna Liverpool • According to a dim and distant memory of a leering lecturer leaving us sniggering first-year law students to ponder the possibilities (Clarke v Clarke, I recall), fecundation ab extra is far from a biological impossibility. Paul Roper High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire • David Cameron has repeated his claim that Britain is a Christian country (Cameron’s seasonal message: feel secure, 24 December). But a report from the Commission on Religion and Belief released in December found that almost half of the UK population now describes itself as non-religious. In 1983, two thirds of the population would have identified as Christian, today it is two in five. The British Social Attitudes survey published in 2014 gives an even higher figure for the non-religious: 50.6%, with just 41.7% regarding themselves as Christian, the lowest ever figure. It is high time Cameron, and others who make the same claim, paid attention to these statistics. George Broadhead Kenilworth, Warwickshire • Jesus proclaimed good news to the poor; David Cameron is bad news. Jesus was bad news to the rich; Cameron is good news. Mary said that her son would topple the mighty from their thrones; Cameron keeps them there. Mary said that her son would lift up the oppressed; Cameron keeps them down. Jesus, Mary and Joseph were refugees; Cameron leaves refugees in squalor and danger. Rev Dr John Simmonds New Tupton, Chesterfield • Chibundu Onuzo’s church is to be warmly commended for distributing 2,000 Christmas parcels (Small acts of love will change the world, 23 December). However she is only half right about changing the world. Her comment that “The poor will always get poorer and the rich … richer” echoes the common misunderstanding of Jesus’s “The poor you will always have with you.” If, as seems most likely given other things Jesus said and did, the emphasis in that phrase should be firmly on the last word, it is actually a judgment on his society that they are not listening to his teachings. If they did the poor would not be getting poorer, likewise the rich. Small acts of love are important but so is tacking inequality. Christian faith teaches that small acts of love and fighting injustice are both needed to change the world.

2015-06-14T17:11:24Z,Rome feels pressure of migration buildup with makeshift refugee camp,"While passengers at Tiburtina, one of Rome’s main train stations and just a 10-minute ride from the Colosseum, tinkled on the station’s piano or stopped off for an ice cream, outside there were more urgent matters at hand. Officials were trying to channel a water tap into a makeshift refugee camp that was opened on Saturday, prompted by the growing number of migrants left in limbo after France increased security at the Italian border. Around 100 migrants are staying in tents in the shadow of the station, a modern transport hub from where travellers are whisked on high-speed trains to cities including Florence and Milan. The camp was opened in a joint effort by the Italian Red Cross and local authorities, after a growing number of migrants began gathering at the train station. Alessandro Radicchi, the Red Cross’s director for combating poverty across Italy’s rail network, said the worsening situation prompted the organisation to act. “They’re here because they’ve closed the border; people wanted to go elsewhere in Europe but now the border’s been blocked. This isn’t just a problem today, this is a problem in general,” he said. News that France has increased security checks on its border has prompted many migrants to temporarily halt their journey north. Although under the EU law asylum seekers must register at their first point of arrival, most of those arriving in Italy by sea avoid doing so in order to travel onwards to northern Europe. The new refugee camp is already equipped with beds and toilets. On Saturday an idle digg ing machine signalled the hasty clearing of the building site to make way for the refugees, who have fled from countries including Syria and Eritrea. But Radicchi was clear that the camp is only a temporary solution; work will begin on Sunday on transforming a disused hotel into accommodation for up to 200 migrants. Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has called for changes to the EU regulation on where asylum seekers must first register. “If the European Council chooses solidarity, good. If it doesn’t, we are ready for plan B. But it would above all hurt Europe,” he told Italian daily Corriere della Sera, without giving further details. Renzi criticised the EU’s “insufficient” proposal to relocate 24,000 refugees from Italy and said he would discuss the migration crisis in upcoming meetings with the UK’s prime minister, David Cameron, and French president, François Hollande. The Italian premier also faces an internal battle, with rightwing politicians rebelling over plans to distribute boat migrants across Italy. Regions across the north were asked by the government to take in 7,500 new arrivals, a request flatly refused by rightwing leaders. The refugee camp at Tiburtina is also intended to take pressure off a nearby Eritrean cultural centre, Baobab, where dozens of migrants queued for meals. Food donations were piled up alongside toys for the children, who passed their time blowing bubbles and playing with rainbow-coloured windmills. Despite the calm atmosphere, the centre’s Eritrean cook said none of the migrants wanted to stay in Italy. Although he made the sea journey a decade ago, the cook chose not to give his name for fear of the impact it could still have on his family back home. New arrivals were equally scared of the backlash they could face from authorities in Eritrea, where citizens face compulsory military conscription and torture is widespread according to Amnesty International. “If you go back, you go to prison,” the cook said. Outside the Baobab centre, a group of young Eritrean men said they planned to travel onwards to France. They had intended to head north by bus or train and were surprised to hear they may now face difficulty in crossing the border. Their counterparts who have already reached north-west Italy tried in vain to enter France on Saturday. Protesting migrants were met with riot police who pushed them back to Ventimiglia, a border town on the Italian coast. Austria and Switzerland have followed France in tightening controls and returning migrants, putting greater pressure on Italy, which has seen more than 50,000 people arrive by sea so far this year."
2015-12-13T04:30:13Z,Global issues don’t live in separate boxes. Why no mention in Paris of refugees? | Alexander Betts,"While the United Nations climate change talks in Paris struggled to elicit credible commitments, notably missing from the debate was “environmental displacement” – people fleeing their homes on account of natural disaster. As temperatures and sea levels rise, and land-use patterns change, there will be significant consequences for human mobility within and across borders. However, public and media debate scarcely discussed the issue, and the only references in the Paris summit’s negotiated outcome document are vague to the point of meaninglessness. This absence is especially striking in a year in which refugees and migration have otherwise been so high on the political agenda. This political dissonance is of a piece with the compartmentalised way in which we approach many global issues. During a frenzied summer, media coverage and political attention focused almost exclusively on refugees. Now, with saturation point reached, the circus has moved on. Climate change has, instead, become the de rigueur liberal issue of the day. Remarkably, the global focus on refugees was insufficient to influence the debate in Paris. When we shift our attention so dramatically, we risk missing important analytical connections and, with them, opportunities for meaningful solutions. To be clear, the so-called European refugee crisis was certainly not caused by climate change. But it is symptomatic of a global protection crisis, with climate change as one key component. That crisis is partly the result of numbers: there are more people displaced around the world than at any time since the second world war. It is partly the result of political will: asylum is being undermined by governments around the world. However, it is above all a reflection of a growing gap between the contemporary nature of displacement and the institutions that govern forced migration. In the aftermath of the second world war, governments created the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. It ensures that states have a reciprocal obligation towards people fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution. This framework was well adapted to the refugee movements of the 20th century. It continues to be relevant, but it leaves gaps. Climate change is one cause that falls outside the existing refugee framework. Sinking islands, desertification and flooding, for instance, can all require people to leave their homes. However, the relationship between environmental change and displacement is complex and multi-causal; shaped by other factors, most notably governance. As Hurricane Katrina illustrated, in countries with strong governance such as the US, a natural disaster is unlikely to require people to cross borders. It is in countries with weaker governance and limited coping capacity that cross-border movements may take place. This was the case with people leaving Haiti for the Dominican Republic following the earthquake in 2010 and from Somalia to Kenya as a result of famine and drought in the Horn of Africa in 2011, for example. So far the institutional response remains limited, though there are two embryonic frameworks. First, in December 2010, an earlier round of the UN climate negotiations created the first international legal recognition of the relationship between climate change and migration. However, the framework did not specify how to address the problem of people moving on account of climate change and has not been built upon in subsequent rounds of negotiations. Second, in October 2015, came a government-led informal process called the Nansen Initiative. This launched a protection agenda, endorsed by 110 countries, though offered no governance framework to support international action. In Paris, there was little progress. The issue has not been a priority for governments. A draft text proposed “a climate change displacement coordination facility”. But this was watered down in the negotiations, leaving only a vague statement about a “task force” to “develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimise and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change”. Standing back from these institutional discussions, it’s debatable whether the climate change negotiations are an adequate venue for addressing the underlying issue. The broader phenomenon is new displacement that falls outside the existing refugee framework but is not reducible to voluntary, economic migration. The huge challenge is how we should respond to the movements of vulnerable people who do not fit the institutional boxes. With the exception of sinking islands, what drives much supposedly environmental displacement is its interaction with a range of other social, economic and political factors. What’s more, if what we care about is ensuring protection for the most vulnerable people, then what matters is not to privilege a particular cause of displacement but to identify a threshold of fundamental rights. When these are unavailable in the country of origin, border crossing has to be guaranteed as a last resort. This wider challenge of how we think about new drivers of displacement can be found in the European refugee crisis. Nearly all Syrians would meet the 1951 standard of “persecution”. However, for many other nationalities the picture is more complex. Most are from refugee-producing countries, but not all would qualify for asylum. Yet this does not mean the residual category can be neatly subsumed under a label of “voluntary, economic migrants”. Rather, a significant proportion of those fleeing countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq are fleeing a chronically fragile state, within which they are unable to secure the minimum conditions of human dignity. It is these types of movement for which the international community lacks an adequate conceptual or institutional response. Part of the solution is about considering how we update and reform the global refugee regime. However, to respond to the 21st-century realities of people moving around the world also requires us to escape traditional silos. Policy responses cannot be found simply through European justice and home affairs policies. The root causes of displacement are inextricable from broader issues of the environment, development and security. From the climate negotiations to the sustainable development goals to next year’s World Humanitarian Summit, human displacement should be an integral and ongoing part of the agenda. Responses to the needs of millions of vulnerable people should not depend not upon box-ticking. Instead, across international processes and branches of government, we need to see the connections and opportunities.

2015-09-03T07:00:03Z,This refugee crisis was a test for David Cameron. He’s flunked it | John Harris,"This is not something I write very often, but I agree with David Miliband. In his capacity as president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, his stern words about the refugee crisis and the UK’s pitiful response were admirably clear and concise, and full of moral urgency: precisely the kind of intervention, in fact, that it would be nice to hear from a few more front-rank British politicians. Perhaps Miliband’s most cutting point was his argument against those commentators and politicians who still insist that the current emergency is down to “migrants”. That word, he says, “suggests these people are voluntarily fleeing, whereas in fact, if you’ve been barrel-bombed out of your home three times, life and limb demand that you flee. It’s not about being politically incorrect in using the term migrant. It’s simply incorrect.” It really is, but the British discourse on migration and asylum has long been awash with conflations of the two, usually for the most self-serving of purposes – and over the last 20 or so years the politics of all this has become hopelessly contorted. The terms “refugee” and “asylum seeker” may denote different things (crudely put, an asylum seeker only becomes a refugee when some or other official agency decides as such), but it’s telling that the R word, with all its moral connotations, has all but disappeared from our national vocabulary. Moreover, from the 1990s onwards, the endless coupling of “asylum seeker” with the word “bogus” embedded the idea that anyone seeking sanctuary was more often than not a fraud. From there, it was a short step to people fleeing war and oppression not being seen as a discrete group at all, and the shoving of refugees into the dehumanising (and borderline meaningless) category of “migrants”. Now, with that word rarely far from the hysterical front pages of the Mail and Express – witness the latter’s headline: “Chaos as ‘biblical’ migrant crisis spreads across Europe” – the job is complete. Even in the face of a self-evident humanitarian catastrophe, we cannot have a sane national conversation, let alone do anything meaningful to help. (With a nice anti-EU opportunity there for the taking, Nigel Farage is back, in full “shock and awful” mode; the government seems to have no coherent line at all. Meanwhile, the reality is increasingly terrible: among many such accounts, the most sobering I read this week was a Unicef report about the 3,000 people from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq now “transiting” through Macedonia every day. A third are women and children; 12% of the women are pregnant.) Going through the British political archives, what got us to this grim impasse becomes clear. In both the 1992 and 1997 elections, John Major was decent enough to insist that asylum should not feature in Tory campaigning, but by 2001 the gloves were off. Early that year, Michael Heseltine – whom history still honours as a “progressive” Conservative – wrote a watershed Mail piece claiming that a “very large number” of supposed refugees were “cheats deliberately making bogus claims and false allegations to get into this country”. British nationals, he said, were being done out of housing and healthcare by “dubious asylum seekers”, and the issue of “phoney asylum seekers was likely to grow as the impression spread that this country was a soft touch”. Such talk obviously spooked the Labour party: by the following year, the then home secretary David Blunkett was claiming that schools were in danger of being “swamped” by the children of asylum seekers, and Tony Blair pledged to halve the numbers of such people coming to the UK, which happened, though it inevitably had more to do with wider world events than government policy. In 2003 the news was full of the government’s idea to send all asylum seekers to reception centres overseas: Albania was suggested. Increasingly, one got the sense that acting “tough” on this issue was a means of somehow distracting attention from the issues of job insecurity, housing shortages and public service provision that so spectacularly exploded when the Blair government decided against transitional controls on migration from the EU accession countries of eastern Europe. By the advent of the Gordon Brown period, in fact, this was Labour’s default setting: scandalising liberal opinion on issues of asylum so as to convince its core vote it was on the case (witness one minister’s claim in 2008 that refugee charities were “playing the system”), while doing virtually nothing about many of the immigration-related issues that sat at the heart of their political problems. Although it is good to hear a creature of the Labour mainstream such as Yvette Cooper suggesting that the UK should accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees, this is the malign side of her party’s record: inflammatory, sometimes mendacious rhetoric, which was always going to undermine any future response to a refugee emergency. Cooper says that doing next to nothing about the crisis would “not be the British way”, but clearly we should not romanticise our past. Even the British record on giving refuge to Jews fleeing Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe is much more complex than some sentimental accounts suggest; similarly, in the late 1970s, though the UK eventually accepted more than 10,000 of the Vietnamese refugees known as boat people, behind the scenes Margaret Thatcher was reluctant to take in any at all, fearing public disorder. Modern history, in fact, offers almost no examples of Britain rising to a refugee crisis without qualification, though the story of how 28,000 expelled Ugandan Asians were given a home here arguably comes closest. The punitive Immigration Act (passed in 1971) arguably made the politics easier, as did the fact that they held British passports. At least one of the pronouncements by the then prime minister Ted Heath offered a clear sense of what is missing from the current conversation. “We hold that it is in the interest of the British people that the reputation of Britain for good faith and humanity should be preserved,” he said. In the wake of his stupid words about the “swarm” of people arriving in Calais, can anyone imagine David Cameron saying – and doing – anything halfway comparable? Evidently not: in response to Cooper’s call, he has so far managed only vapid words about trying to “bring peace and stability” to Syria and beyond, and somehow making sure “there are worthwhile jobs and stronger economies there”. If there was any shred left of the progressive, “modernising” politician who wanted to avenge the idea of the “nasty party” and take on the uglier aspects of Labour’s record, this was arguably his moment. The case for an act of principled leadership was glaring. But on the barren political ground left by his predecessors, he flunked it."
2015-11-23T15:00:01Z,Refugee Boy by Benjamin Zephaniah - review,"Refugee Boy is about a boy whose parents are from Ethiopia and Eritrea. It’s set at a time of civil war between the two countries; his mum is from Eritrea and his dad is from Ethiopia. The story is really about their son Alem. He went from living with the two people he loved most in Africa to being all alone in the world in the UK. His father brought him to England to get him away from the war, to safety, and after three days he left him and returned to Africa. Alem was left in a care home and it was an awful experience. He got bullied, he was an outsider. It’s about a family who were connected becoming disconnected. The book really affected me. It has changed how I relate to people. It’s made me feel that I don’t want to be rude to anyone; I feel more sympathetic. What if they have a story a bit like Alem’s? It’s made me stop judging people by the way they look; I now want to get know people and hear their stories. I see life from a different perspective. Through the book you see what war can do to people and how people can develop; how you don’t know who people are until you dig deep. I had a story of my own that I didn’t want to tell people that made me different and reading the book made me speak out to my friends. Reading the book I felt so emotional. Something awful happens to Alem (I won’t tell you what because I don’t want to spoil the book) and I felt such empathy for him. He was emotional, depressed, isolated and incredibly alone and trapped. You should read this book if you have ever judged someone by their appearance, or the way they act. Reading this book, you are going to understand people better and see others for who they really are. And actually it improves your friendships; you look at the world in a different way. There’s a political side to it too. People who think refugees are job stealing and worthless people should read this book and understand they have been through so much and deserve refuge and a fresh start in life. If you were in their shoes, you would want that wouldn’t you? When refugees come to the UK they want to make something of themselves; Alem wants to become an architect. I think Benjamin Zephaniah is a great writer. He has obviously listened to people in Alem’s shoes and he’s a deep thinker and he’s done the research and you can feel that he is so inspired. I give this book 10 out 10. It’s one of the most powerful books I’ve ever read. It’s stayed in my heart and mind. I recommended it to my mum and she read it as she was born in Eritrea, and she loved it. I’ve been to Ethiopia and this book has made me realise you can do anything you set your heart on. I recommend it for over 11’s because it’s a bit upsetting. Read it please. It will help you enjoy life, be compassionate and open up to people more.

2015-09-04T17:08:05Z,Harper's Canada has more than one refugee death on its hands | Martin Lukacs,"Undeserving people exploiting the generosity of a benevolent government. Cheating an application process. Taking advantage of welfare. Stealing our jobs. That is the image of “bogus refugees” that Canada’s Conservative government has spent years carefully cultivating. But a single photo of a drowned child has shattered all the stories meant to harden Canadians. 3-year old Alan Kurdi’s fate off Turkey’s shore has seared the reality of the refugee crisis into our consciousness and left Canadians stunned about our government’s complicity in the death of a child. Those now putting Canada’s refugee policies under scrutiny will realize that this much else is clear: the Harper government has more than one refugee’s death on its hands. It is not simply that Alan Kurdi’s family’s attempt to reach Canada was hampered by the government. Nor that Canada’s Immigration Minister ignored a hand-delivered plea. Under the Harper government’s overhaul of the immigration and refugee system, those fleeing war, poverty or persecution arrive not to a haven but a hazard. Never has this country been more unkind and unwelcoming. The government regularly boasts how refugee claimants have dropped in half in the last several years. It’s no surprise, given their tactics. Like border agents installed in airports around the world, preventing refugees from boarding flights. Or billboards in Europe telling the Roma to forget about seeking asylum. Or new laws that arbitrarily label countries as “safe” - even decidedly unsafe ones like Hungary and Mexico - and thus prohibit people there from applying for refugee status. Those lucky enough to try are being rejected by a bureaucratic selection rigged to take less and less people. Refugees that reach Canada discover it resembles more a fortress than a liberal country. The government throws into detention any “irregular arrivals” – as desperate people are bound to be. 10,000 people every year – including hundreds of children – wallow in detention facilities that go by disturbing names like Montreal’s “Immigration Prevention Centre,” surrounded by razor-wire fences, on the outskirts of major cities. Others are thrown into provincial prisons, including maximum-security: that makes Canada the only western country that jails refugees and migrants in the same place as convicts. Those who stick out the process do not comfortably freeload at the state’s expense, as Conservative officials say to stoke fear and resentment. Conservative cuts denied refugees access to temporary basic healthcare – including pregnant women and cancer patients. This, when migrants use social assistance less than Canadians, and subsidize the economy by working jobs that many Canadians never would. So much for the “social program buffet” that Canada’s Immigration Minister claims refugees gorge at. A new website by a refugee and migrant justice group documents the range of these hardships that refugees live through in Canada. Many are never even granted the privilege of suffering through this. A staggering 100,000 people in the last ten years have simply been deported. The number cannot capture the chain of misery it encompasses. Week in and out, migrant advocates hear of deportations back to murder, sexual abuse and religious persecution. Had 3 year-old Kurdi’s family eventually made it to Canada “irregularly,” that too may have been their fate. Not a safe welcome. Immediate detention. Or a surprise visit by suited border agents, at home or at the children’s school. Then shuffled onto a plane and deported back to the Middle East. But Canadians shouldn’t just be concerned about how mean and harsh their country has become. The Canadian government has a hand in creating the global refugee crisis in the first place. Under the Harper government, Canada has been an enthusiastic participant in US-led wars throughout North Africa and the Middle East. In Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, societies have been torn apart, fuelling extremist movements like ISIS and spilling hundreds of thousands of people into Europe and beyond. Prime Minister Harper cynically suggested yesterday that more war is a solution; it is in fact a key source of the problem. Factor in the global trade pacts that Canada supports, as part of a financial architecture that yearly sucks more money out of Africa than the continent receives. The immiseration of these countries have turned them into barren prisons that every young person seeks to flee. And let’s not forget how climate change – to which Canada has made a brazenly oversized contribution – helped push Syria into civil war. Unless we halt runaway carbon emissions, the escalating and cascading impacts of climate change will make the current flow of refugees look like a dribble. While the Harper government has shut its doors to refugees, they have opened them wide open to migrant workers – so long as they remain precarious, low-wage, without permanent residency or access to labour protections and social services that Canadians take for granted. The number of migrants to Canada has exploded. Hundreds of thousands are now brought in to work on farms, care for our elderly, and staff fast-food joints – good enough to work, but not good enough to stay. These migrant policies are the flip-side of a system that treats people – especially those of colour from the global south – as disposable. This is the clue to understanding Canada’s current refugee and immigration policies, for it unravels all the myths of benevolence. The incredible fortressing of Canada, much like Europe, has nothing to do with the burden these populations supposedly pose to to the resources of this country. Canada has always needed a larger labour force and a huge influx of immigrants. But in an age of increasing wealth and inequality, the precarity imposed on refugees and migrants is no accident. It is by design. It is a callous and calculated management of vulnerable populations – exploiting some, excluding others. That is what Canada’s system has become. For now, a tragic and iconic image has pierced a political discourse that has demeaned and dehumanized refugees for too long. It has thrown Conservatives policies, in the midst of an election, into a new light. Already the government is in damage control, suspending the campaign of its Immigration Minister. It cancelled an event yesterday where they were meant to announce more immigration security measures. Their fear? That such punitive campaigning will no longer wash. More security – more detentions and deportations, more fences and walls – is not what is needed. And indeed the cruelty of the Conservatives has been defied by the compassion of Canadians: “How to sponsor a Syrian?” is now the country’s top Google query on refugees. Actions calling on the Canadian government to receive more Syrians are being organized over the next week across the country. They can take inspiration from residents in Germany, whose protests have forced their government to allow 800,000 refugees into the country. Or Iceland, where 10,000 people have offered to open their homes. “Refugees are welcome” should be the first slogan broadcast. Open the door immediately to tens of thousands of refugees from Syria and elsewhere. But that will not suffice. Now is the moment to debate an overhaul to the system, starting by reversing the damage the Conservatives have done. And that cannot begin without a reckoning of our own hand in the refugee crisis. Canada’s fortress-style border policies at home and its wars abroad have never been a help, but a lethal contribution. @Martin_Lukacs"
2015-08-20T07:13:27Z,Calais crisis: British police to be deployed to target people-smuggling,"British police will be deployed in Calais to target people-smuggling gangs as part of a new agreement aimed at alleviating the ongoing migrant crisis at the French port. In the first visit to Calais by a UK government minister since the crisis escalated at the start of the summer, home secretary Theresa May arrived in the town on Thursday to confirm a joint declaration with Bernard Cazeneuve, the French minister of the interior. Their deal will see officers from the UK based in a new command and control centre in Calais alongside their French counterparts and Border Force personnel. The work of the police contingent will be led by two senior commanders – one from the UK and one from France. They will report regularly to May and Cazeneuve on the extent of immigration-related criminal activity on both sides of the Channel. Officials said the move was aimed at disrupting organised criminals, who attempt to smuggle migrants illegally into northern France and across the Channel into Britain, by ensuring intelligence and enforcement work is more collaborative. Britain and France will also work jointly to ensure networks are dismantled and prosecutions are pursued, sources said. Fresh measures included in the new agreement include: The deployment of extra French policing units and additional freight search teams, including detection dogs The investment of UK resources including fencing, CCTV, flood lighting and infrared detection technology to secure the Eurotunnel railhead The tightening of security within the tunnel itself, with Eurotunnel helping to increase the number of guards protecting the site The creation of a new “integrated control room” covering the railheads at Coquelles A security audit to be carried out by specialist French and British police teams to underpin the design of the improvements. The British government has already pledged £22m aimed at improving security at Calais, where thousands of migrants have attempted to stow away on vehicles waiting to cross the Channel or on trains passing through the Channel tunnel. Up to 5,000 migrants are estimated to be in the French port, with at least nine people known to have died trying to make the journey into Britain since June. At the height of the crisis in late July, an estimated 2,000 attempts to break into the port terminal were said to have been made on two successive nights. Previous talks involving the British prime minister, David Cameron, and the French president, François Hollande, led to a string of measures to improve security – including extra fencing, more search teams, additional CCTV cameras, infrared detectors and floodlights. These seem to have abated the crisis, with sources revealing last week that the number of migrant attempts had fallen. Last weekend, Cameron intensified his language by stating that many migrants attempting to get into Britain were doing so for economic reasons, and that he was determined to make sure the border was secure. “They are economic migrants and they want to enter Britain illegally, and the British people and I want to make sure our borders are secure and you can’t break into Britain without permission,” he said. However, concerns have been raised that closing off openings at Calais will prompt migrants to attempt to make the crossing by different routes. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, welcomed May’s visit to Calais, but added: “We must be aware of the dangers of the domino principle. Closing off one route will only mean the problem moves to another port. “There is already evidence of more illegal activity around Dunkirk, Zeebrugge and the Hook of Holland. We need agreements with countries across the north coast to stop this situation developing before we see Calais-like crises spring up at ports across the continent. “This remains an EU problem. If we do not take control urgently, by the end of the year we could easily see the number of migrants reaching Europe equivalent to the populations of both Malta and Luxembourg combined.” The situation at Calais is part of a wider migration surge into Europe, mainly from north Africa and the Middle East. On Tuesday, the EU border agency Frontex reported a record high of 107,500 migrants at the European Union’s borders last month. However, Steve Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee programme director, said Europe could not avoid “the biggest global refugee crisis” since the second world war. “When Theresa May goes to Calais she should drop the ‘tough’ rhetoric on refugees and start talking about how the UK can save lives and protect the vulnerable,” he said. May and Cazeneuve will visit the site around the Eurotunnel rail terminal in Coquelles, before Cazeneuve travels to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière for talks on Europe’s migration policies, the French interior ministry said."
2016-10-19T23:47:39Z,Is the fourth industrial revolution bad news for migrants and refugees?,"You don’t have to be a luddite to be worried about the effect technology is going to have on employment. When asked: ‘What do you think is the biggest threat to job security in Australia?’ in an Essential poll last month, 18% of those surveyed said it was the impact of technological change, while 31% said there was more to fear from free-trade deals that allow foreign workers into the labour market. Combined, it means almost half of Australians fear technology or foreigners are a threat to their jobs. This leads to some fundamental questions about the impact the fourth industrial revolution is going to have on migration and refugees. If jobs now routinely done by migrants (such as cleaning, fast food and other low-skilled, low-paid work) are increasingly automated, does it mean countries take fewer migrants? Does it mean they will only want well-educated migrants? And does this have implications for how refugees are valued by the wider community? Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre, says refugees have often filled jobs in rural areas. “Most particularly during the mining boom, young Australian men would much rather go to the mines where they could earn $100,000 a year plus, than go out and work in the agricultural field. So for instance, in meat processing, chicken processing and a lot of the heavy agricultural work in isolated locations, they were desperate for workers,” she says. Curr says Hazaras, who mainly come from central Afghanistan and have a background in agriculture, regularly filled regional jobs, often in very isolated locations, after coming out of immigration detention in Australia. But those isolated locations have just become a little less isolated. As of 29 September, farmers are allowed to fly 25kg drones over their property without an unmanned aircraft operator’s certificate. “That’s a drone that can take a pretty good payload, could carry a fair bit of chemical around for crop-spraying, [and] could easily carry cameras and other gear to do visual inspections,” said Peter Gibson of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Not every job taken over by drones will be one previously done by a migrant, of course, and Sydney-based migration agent John McQuaid says Australia is looking at technology and innovation as a positive. “The government looks at what ideas can be turned into employment opportunities for Australians. What they are seeing is that the innovations area [such as new business startups, entrepreneurs and research] is providing jobs at a rate four or five times above almost any other start-up type businesses,” he said. The federal government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda website says it “is helping innovators to get funding to back their ideas and have a go”. As part of its “global innovation strategy”, which started in July 2016, the government is investing $36m over four years to improve Australia’s international science, research and innovation collaboration. One of the strategy’s aims is “to build strong regional linkages in the Asia-Pacific”. Dr Anna Boucher of the University of Sydney is a migration specialist – she co-founded the migration studies unit at the London School of Economics – and says technology will not lead to a drop in immigration. “Australia has, as a percentage of population, one of the highest rates of immigration in the developed, western world … and I don’t see that changing any time soon,” she said. “If you look at all the predictions on immigration that have come through the [Australian government’s] intergenerational reports over the last 10 to 15 years, they have all been downwardly conservative, so what actually happened has been much greater than what has been predicted. “If we look at what’s happened with automation already over the last, say, 20 years, and what’s happened with immigration, there doesn’t seem to be an inverse relationship. Not all of this can be controlled by government. If people want to migrate, they figure out ways to migrate. They’ll work through the channels that exist, and if they can’t then they’ll work through illegal channels to migrate.” Jiyoung Song, director of migration and border policy at the Lowy Institute, says economic migrants normally fill gaps in the labour market, rather than replace people. “There will still be the need of skilled migrants who will work across different national boundaries. The future of work is already having an impact on our lives.” She says advances in technology means national borders are increasingly no barrier to jobs – for instance, there is no reason a computer coder in India can’t do work for companies in Australia, the US or anywhere. While well-educated migrants are very much in global demand, people with fewer skills will still also be needed, Song says. “Those with the wanted knowledge and skill sets are likely to have greater mobility than those without. However, countries need both skilled and low-skilled migrants to fill the jobs the locals can’t do or don’t want to do, in other words, either the most cutting-edge jobs or the most unwanted jobs in domestic markets.” She says advances in technology are unlikely to affect how refugees are valued. “Refugees are accepted for humanitarian grounds, not economic demand ... However, in recent years and at the UN summit [in September], legal and complementary pathways were suggested as alternative ways to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. “What this means is that governments are considering the option to offer various other ways to settle temporarily and permanently for refugees and asylum seekers who have skills they want. This is a progressive solution not many governments are buying into at the moment, but it is the only viable way to solve the current refugee crisis,” said Song. Matching refugees’ skills to jobs in their new country benefits both the individual and the host nation. In Berlin, Syrian refugee and developer Hussein Shaker, who struggled to find work using his IT skills due to his lack of German, co-founded MigrantHire. He soon found that tech companies in the city were so desperate for developers they didn’t care whether employees could speak German. It was their knowledge of ones and zeroes that mattered most. Such innovation is happening locally too, with the Red Cross partnering with tech communities in Sydney and Melbourne for “Techfugees hackathons” to find new ways that can help refugee families settle into Australian life. Techfugees looks to address some of the issues faced by refugees and asylum seekers by connecting developers, designers, entrepreneurs and startups with non-profit and community organisations. Vicki Mau, manager of migration support programs at Red Cross, says the ideas that have come out of Techfugees, such as an app to help connect migrants with interpreters and another to help link individuals to friends, mentors, services and employment, have been very innovative. “These are great for Red Cross and invaluable for participants, such as refugees and asylum seekers looking for work and mentors,” she said."
2016-08-04T11:30:19Z,Costa Rica expects asylum claims to quadruple as refugees head south,"Asylum claims in Costa Rica are set to quadruple this year from 2014 as stricter controls in Mexico and the US force Central Americans fleeing violence and political instability to find new migration routes. Tens of thousands of Central Americans from the “Northern Triangle” countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have fled their homes in recent years to escape violent criminal gangs who regularly target civilians for murder, rape and extortion. While most of this migrant flow still heads north, some refugees have found homes elsewhere on the Central American isthmus. While Belize and Panama have also seen spikes in migration, Costa Rica, one of the most politically and economically stable countries in the region, has become an attractive alternative for Central American refugees. Now, the country is going one step further, following the announcement of a new scheme to offer temporary protection to refugees from the Northern Triangle. Under the new protection transfer agreement (PTA), Costa Rica will accept up to 200 prescreened refugees for periods of up to six months, while their US asylum applications are processed. Migrants who arrive in Costa Rica before applying will not be considered for US asylum. Though only a small number of migrants will benefit from the project, it marks a significant change in the international response to fleeing Central Americans, who were previously considered primarily as economic migrants, unqualified for refugee status. “It is a shift in the way both the US and the region are looking at the outflows from the Northern Triangle,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with Washington-based thinktank Migration Policy. “This is a recognition that people in the Northern Triangle are facing true refugee circumstances and can’t stay in their countries.” The PTA will be the first time in recent Latin American history that a third country will offer temporary protection to refugees. The United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration will assume all costs associated with the project, and if it is successful, organizers hope to broker similar agreements with other countries throughout the region. The announcement is also significant for Costa Rica, which along with managing the spike in asylum applications from the Northern Triangle has found itself at the center of two separate migrant crises, following a border crackdown by its northern neighbor, Nicaragua. After the closure stranded nearly 8,000 US-bound Cubans in the country late last year, the government housed them in shelters while it brokered an airlift with its regional allies. With Nicaragua now blocking the entry of more than 2,000 extra-continental migrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, Costa Rica has again promised the migrants safe passage and offered applications for asylum and spots in several shelters throughout the country. “We consider Costa Rica a champion in managing immigration and an example for the region,” said Carlos Maldonado, the UNHCR chief in Costa Rica. “Human rights has always been one of Costa Rica’s key trademarks and the country’s government, people and civil society have acted admirably when faced with these migrant flows,” he added. Though on its own the PTA will not be bringing Central American refugees to Costa Rica permanently, some experts believe that the agreement and the country’s other refugee-friendly policies could encourage more migrants to try moving south. “It is hard to imagine that the country accepting two hundred people for transfer would change the flow significantly,” Hipsman said, “but the fact that Costa Rica is publicly accepting refugees for processing could signal to would-be refugees or migrants that it might be a more welcoming place.”"
2016-09-07T00:01:44Z,"Nearly half of all refugees are children, says Unicef","Children now make up more than half of the world’s refugees, according to a Unicef report, despite the fact they account for less than a third of the global population. Just two countries – Syria and Afghanistan – comprise half of all child refugees under protection by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), while roughly three-quarters of the world’s child refugees come from just 10 countries. New and on-going global conflicts over the last five years have forced the number of child refugees to jump by 75% to 8 million, the report warns, putting these children at high risk of human smuggling, trafficking and other forms of abuse. The Unicef report (pdf) – which pulls together the latest global data regarding migration and analyses the effect it has on children – shows that globally some 50 million children have either migrated to another country or been forcibly displaced internally; of these, 28 million have been forced to flee by conflict. It also calls on the international community for urgent action to protect child migrants; end detention for children seeking refugee status or migrating; keep families together; and provide much-needed education and health services for children migrants. “Though many communities and people around the world have welcomed refugee and migrant children, xenophobia, discrimination, and exclusion pose serious threats to their lives and futures,” said Unicef’s executive director, Anthony Lake. “But if young refugees are accepted and protected today, if they have the chance to learn and grow, and to develop their potential, they can be a source of stability and economic progress.” Today children comprise one-eighth of all international migrants in the world (31 million children out of 244 million total migrants), according to 2015 data. The vast majority of child migrants – some 3.7 million children – live in the US, followed by Saudi Arabia and Jordan, while in Europe, the UK hosts the largest number of migrants under the age of 18 (close to 750,000). Unicef UK is calling on the UK government to step up action to ensure that refugee children stranded in Europe can reach safety with their families in the UK. “Today, nearly one in every 200 children in the world is a refugee,” said Lily Caprani, Unicef UK’s deputy executive director. “In the last few years we have seen huge numbers of children being forced to flee their homes, and take dangerous, desperate journeys, often on their own. Children on the move are at risk of the worst forms of abuse and harm and can easily fall victim to traffickers and other criminals. “Many of these children wouldn’t resort to such extreme measures if the UK government made them aware that they may have a legal right to come to the UK safely, and if they provided the resources to make that process happen before these terrible journeys begin.” The vast majority of the world’s child migrants live in Asia or Africa, the report says. Asia is the birthplace of nearly half (43%) of all the migrants in the world, with nearly 60% of these migrants moving within the region. Most of Asia’s child migrants are hosted in Saudi Arabia, which also receives the highest number of labour migrants – the report’s authors say more research is needed to understand the connection between the two. Globally, Turkey has the largest share of refugees – including adults – under protection by the UNHCR, and is believed to host the most child refugees as well. In Africa, nearly one in three migrants is a child – nearly twice the global average – and three in five refugees are children. African migrants move both within and beyond the continent’s borders in nearly equal numbers; South Africa and Ivory Coast are the top two host countries for immigrants. But on-going conflict in many countries, in addition to linguistic difficulties between peoples and extremely limited resources to deal with migrant and refugee populations, mean that “the economic and social pressures of hosting threaten to uproot refugees once more”, the report warns. Understanding how and why children move within or beyond their birth countries is hugely important but usually hidden from view, says Dale Rutstein of Unicef’s Office of Research – Innocenti, which is investigating the multiple drivers that push children to start new lives, and the problems that they face as a result. “The systems we have in place for people fleeing or seeking asylum are focused on adults, and in no way are articulated for children,” he says. “They are usually based on border control and law enforcement, yet we know that detention for a child is the worst thing that can happen and can create significant problems [for] a child’s development. But time and time again, we see that states don’t have any system for [holding] children apart from [putting them in] detention.” Data clearly shows that refugee and migrant children disproportionately face poverty and exclusion despite being in great need of aid and resources, and in many circumstances are required to handle their own legal cases as they lack any form of legal representation. “In many parts of the world, children are often and regularly in court proceedings where they have no legal representative and no adult representation, most notably on the border between Central America and the US,” says Rutstein. “Think of how absurd it is for a child to be arguing their case against a government-appointed lawyer. Often states believe they are set up to protect ‘their own’ children, but children have to be children anywhere and everywhere, and need to have the same standard forms of protection and treatment [around the world].” The report calls on the international community to fulfil the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, which obliges ratifying countries to respect and protect the rights of all children within their territories, regardless of a child’s background or migration status. While legal frameworks protecting refugees and other adult migrants is unclear and fragmented, the report says, the children’s convention is clear and unequivocal, taking into account minors’ particular vulnerabilities."
2016-11-16T17:50:38Z,"In one week, 240 feared drowned in Med","About 240 people are suspected to have drowned this week in four separate incidents in the Mediterranean, raising the total annual death toll to an unprecedented 4,500. Deaths in the Mediterranean are now nearly 20% higher than last year’s total of 3,771, which was the previous annual record. About 130 asylum seekers are missing after a rubber boat capsized on Sunday night, while another 100 are thought to have drowned on Tuesday night in a separate incident, the UN refugee agency said. Up to 10 people died in two further tragedies in recent days, bringing the death toll this week to at least 240. In the accident on Sunday 15 survivors were left in the water for 10 hours, clinging on to a piece of a capsized boat, before being rescued by an oil tanker. Nine are still in hospital, Iosto Ibba, a spokesman for UNHCR, said in a phone call. Migration between Turkey and Greece has lessened significantly since March, after Turkey agreed to re-admit people deported from Greece. But crossings between Libya and Italy continue unabated. More than 165,000 people have reached Italy so far this year from north Africa, and the final annual total is likely to surpass the previous record of 170,000. Ibba said the continuing migration flows, and rising death tolls, showed why Europe needed to provide asylum seekers with more legal routes to safety. “Without alternative ways to reach Europe, refugees will always try to reach safety in dangerous ways,” said Ibba. “That’s why it’s so important to expand legal pathways for refugees, including humanitarian admissions, family reunification programmes, private sponsorship, and student visas for refugees. At the same time it’s also important to support the countries of origin and transit, and to keep up search-and-rescue missions, without which the death toll would be even higher.” European countries are attempting to stem migration flows by providing more aid to African countries that agree to re-admit deported asylum seekers. Additionally, navies from countries such as Britain are intercepting and destroying Libyan smugglers’ repurposed fishing trawlers after they enter international waters. But that strategy has failed because smugglers have instead packed their customers into disposable rubber boats – which can be operated by the refugees themselves, allowing the smugglers to remain in Libya. The rising death toll in 2016 can be partly explained by the increasing use of the inflatable boats, which are even more dangerous than the wooden ships they replaced. Syrians are no longer using Libya as a springboard to reach Europe. Instead, Libya is mainly used by people fleeing war and poverty in Nigeria and Sudan, or repression in Eritrea and Gambia. Others are migrant workers who tried to find jobs in Libya, but fled after the civil war there led to the collapse of law and order. Many migrants are kept in slavery-like conditions by their Libyan employers, while others are tortured or extorted, sometimes by the authorities. About 70% say they faced some kind of exploitation in Libya, according to research by the International Organisation for Migration."
2016-12-08T14:35:00Z,EU met only 5% of target for relocating refugees from Greece and Italy,"European countries have relocated only one in 20 of the refugees they promised to shelter, amid continuing deep divisions over how the continent should help growing numbers fleeing war and persecution. More than a year after the EU promised to disperse 160,000 refugees from overstretched Greece and Italy to other EU countries, only 8,162 people have been found a home, figures from the European commission show. Although the EU has met only 5% of its goal, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of migration, declared it was possible to hit the target by September 2017. The Greek commissioner hailed a rise in resettlement numbers in November and predicted the trend would get better. “More and more member states have opened their doors,” he said. “I believe that very soon we will be in a position to say that the relocation scheme works.” A total of 6,212 refugees have been relocated from Greece and 1,950 from Italy, the two countries at the frontline of Europe’s migration crisis. The EU forced through a refugee quota plan in September 2015 as it scrambled to deal with the arrival of more than 1.2 million asylum seekers that year. But the agreement was bitterly opposed by central European countries, which have scarcely bothered to implement a policy they saw as unworkable and a breach of sovereignty. Hungary and Poland have not taken any asylum seekers from Greece or Italy. Slovakia, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency until the end of the month, has given shelter to only nine people, while the Czech Republic has taken 12. The UK, which can opt out on parts of European asylum policy, chose not to participate in the scheme. Europe’s deep-rooted divisions on migration will be on display on Friday when EU home affairs ministers meet in Brussels to debate the meaning of “effective solidarity”, the latest EU buzzword on how to share the cost of asylum seekers. In May, the European commission called on countries that refused to take in asylum seekers to pay a €250,000 (£212,000) “solidarity contribution” for every person Brussels thought they should take. The Visegrád quartet of central European states denounced the idea as blackmail. Slovakia has been trying to steer countries towards compromise, but diplomats have conceded that no breakthroughs will emerge on Friday or next week when the issue is kicked up to an EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The latest commission data also shows that 748 people have been sent back from the Greek islands to Turkey under a controversial deal between Ankara and the EU, which has helped to sharply reduce migrant flows. Under the one-for-one deal agreed in March, the EU promised to shelter one Syrian refugee living in Turkey in exchange for sending back someone denied asylum in Europe. To meet its part of the bargain, the EU has so far taken 2,761 Syrian refugees from Turkey, but this falls far short of the 12,000 places mooted and the 72,000 places available under EU law. So far the EU has delivered €677m of the €3bn promised for Syrian refugees in Turkey by the end of 2017. The EU effort is certain to disappoint Turkey, which is sheltering 3.2 million refugees. Turkey’s outgoing ambassador to the EU, Selim Yenel, told the Guardian in September that he believed the EU had promised a long-term scheme that would see 150,000 to 200,000 refugees a year resettled in Europe. Tensions between Ankara and Brussels are already running high after the European parliament voted to freeze Turkey’s EU accession talks, prompting Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, to threaten to tear up the migration deal. Behind the scenes, EU officials have expressed confidence the Turkey deal will stick. Leaders are using it as the template for agreements with five African countries – Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali – where many attempting the dangerous crossing to Italy come from. A draft of next week’s summit conclusions seen by the Guardian shows that EU leaders will call for migration pacts to be considered for other unnamed countries “taking into account available resources”. European leaders are anxious to show they have a grip on migrant numbers before a series of crucial elections in 2017. Meanwhile the EU institutions want to demonstrate EU refugee policy can work. To that end, the EU executive issued a vote of confidence in Greece’s overstretched asylum system by calling for an end to the six-year ban on refugees being returned there. Under EU rules, refugees can be sent back from a member state to the one they first arrived in. But countries have been prevented from returning asylum seekers to Greece since 2011, after the European court of human rights ruled that conditions in its asylum centres were so bad they were tantamount to “degrading treatment”. The court also found that people at risk of persecution were at risk of being sent back to their country of origin without due legal process. Hailing progress by the Greek authorities, on Thursday the European commission recommended a “gradual” restart in refugee returns to Greece from 15 March 2017. The commission also announced it was dropping legal proceedings against Greece and Italy, as both countries were now compliant with an EU law on taking fingerprints of new asylum claimants. But in an acknowledgement of shortcomings, the ban on refugee returns to Greece will remain in place for children and vulnerable groups. Countries wishing to send asylum claimants back to Greece will also need to take the unusual step of getting assurances from Greek authorities. National governments and courts will have the final say on the commission’s recommendation. Although EU officials expect only a small number of people to be affected by the policy shift, it is a powerful symbolic move intended to show the EU has migrant flows under control. But the move is likely to face criticism from refugee rights groups that have highlighted squalid, overcrowded conditions for tens of thousands of people in Greek asylum camps. More than 57,000 people are stranded in temporary camps in Greece, living in conditions that do not meet international humanitarian standards, according to the International Rescue Committee. The IRC, along with other NGO observers, has documented long queues for food and water, and a lack of schooling and opportunities for work."
2016-09-17T20:07:01Z,"Migrant death toll expected to exceed 10,000 in 2016","The world is on course to register its highest number of migrant deaths this year, as criticism mounts over failing international efforts to cope with the global refugee crisis. Forecasts from analysts at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) indicate that the number of fatalities among refugees will pass the landmark figure of 10,000 in 2016. The dire statistic will cast a shadow over two high-profile summits on migration in New York this week: on Monday the UN general assembly will meet to discuss the record volume of individuals forced to flee their homes as a result of crises and war around the world. That number currently stands at 65 million people, including 21.3 million refugees who have been forced to flee their country. On Tuesday, US president Barack Obama will host a leaders’ summit – to be attended by the prime minister, Theresa May – intended to raise funds for refugee initiatives and expanded resettlement programmes. Julia Black, of the charity Missing Migrants Project at its data analysis centre in Berlin, said that the organisation was confident that the world was facing its highest-ever mortality migration rate. She told the Observer: “Last year we had more than 5,000 deaths across the world. This year we’re already at more than 4,000, but outside of the Mediterranean and Europe the information is so poor we really think it’s a gross underestimate. “This year we’ll reach that 5,000 total again realistically, but I would expect the real figure would be twice as much. The order of magnitude is greater than anything we’ve seen.” A huge proportion of migrant deaths occur from drownings during the hazardous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy. The latest figures show that 3,212 have died so far during 2016 making the journey. The IOM also said it had logged 400 deaths due to migration this year in Latin America. “But the number could easily be two or three times that figure,” said Black. On Saturday thousands of people marched through central London calling on the UK government to display stronger leadership in finding a humane international response to the refugee crisis and urging May to adopt a leading role at the New York meetings. On Saturday night Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, joined calls for May to provide more safe routes of passage to Britain in addition to increasing help for unaccompanied child refugees and accelerating plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians. “The decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging. Britain has always done its bit to help those fleeing persecution – we have to live up to those values again now,” said Cooper. The draft document for the UN summit has been heavily criticised by human rights groups who say it has effectively “sabotaged” its outcome by removing any proposals of substance. Critics also point to the UK government’s donor conference for Syria, held in London in February, which seven months on has yielded only one sixth of the £6bn pledged. On Friday, it emerged that fewer than 5,000 asylum seekers have been relocated from Greece and Italy to other European countries. Adopted one year ago, the EU relocation scheme was designed to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from frontline EU countries. New reports indicate that some Syrian refugees are opting to return home. Ghias Aljundi, a Syrian refugee and adviser to Amnesty International’s campaign on refugees, said that families stranded in Greek refugee camps were so fed up having to wait months in “dire” conditions they were choosing to return to Syria, where more than 470,000 have died in the civil war. “They want to go home to Syria. And we all know how bad the situation is there. One father said: ‘We have lost hope in Europe, we have lost trust in Europe,’” added Aljundi. The dangers faced by refugees will be highlighted in a series of reports unveiled this week. Among them one by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) which is expected to reveal that three-quarters of those who crossed via Libya experienced physical violence, and over a quarter detailed experiences relating to the death of fellow travellers."
2016-06-08T11:51:00Z,Experts sound alarm over mental health toll borne by migrants and refugees,"The grief of losing a child made more unbearable by the knowledge that you decided to take them in a boat that capsized; nightmares about torture; depression induced by the awfulness of living in a camp, unable to go forward or back. As concern mounts about the conditions faced by refugees and migrants in camps across Europe, and more people die trying to reach the continent, the mental health of those who have risked everything in the hope of starting a new life in Europe is gaining more attention. A report last year by the German Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists said 40%-50% of people arriving in Germany suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with half also suffering from depression. “They have nightmares or flashbacks to pictures or scenes. These memories feel very intense, and it is just like they are reliving the traumatising experience,” the report said. Other symptoms include jumpiness, sleep disorders, problems with concentration, and emotional numbness. “It is shameful that people suffering with such psychological injuries do not get the help they need,” the report said. Post-traumatic stress is just the tip of the iceberg. “PTSD is very important, but it is also the disorder that everyone jumps to, including the media. We see much more depression and anxiety disorders, and also, surprisingly, a lot of epilepsy and psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia,” said Dr Inka Weissbecker, global mental health and psychosocial adviser at the International Medical Corps in Washington. “There are huge amounts of anxiety – we see children bursting into tears when helicopters or airplanes fly over the camps, and we can’t understand why, until we realise what they’re associating it with,” said Harriet Zych, a nurse with Doctors of the World who worked in Idomeni – site of Europe’s largest informal refugee camp, on Greece’s northern border with Macedonia – before Greek police moved people to other locations in May. “We came across many people in a state of collapse, whose problems turn out to be psychological rather than physical,” she said. “One man hit himself with a rock on his head until he became unconscious when he found out he couldn’t cross the border.” Nikos Gionakis, a psychologist with the Athens-based mental health unit Babel, tells the story of Hassan, 34, who fled Syria with his four children. “Passing from Turkey to Greece, he was forced to get into a boat by smugglers. Two of his kids drowned as the boat sank. He was referred to Babel because of depression. He blames himself for not having been able to protect his kids,” Gionakis said. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, says mental health disorders can hinder integration into host populations, creating long-term problems for European countries that are accepting refugees fleeing from conflicts in Syria and elsewhere. In a paper to the European commission last year, the European Psychiatric Association said: “Acute and long-term psychiatric care needs to be provided to all asylum seekers in order to avoid reaching chronic conditions of mental disorders.” Aid workers in Greece say diagnosis, never mind treatment, is almost impossible in the chaos of the camps and detention centres in southern Europe. “You cannot say how many people are suffering from PTSD because diagnosis takes too long, and with such a stream of people, it is impossible. I am a trained psychologist with 40 years’ experience; it would take me two and a half hours to diagnose someone with PTSD,” said Renos Papadopoulos, director of the Centre for Trauma, Asylum, and Refugees at Essex University, who recently returned from Greece. “There is no evidence [on the prevalence of PTSD] because there cannot be evidence. The situation is complete chaos.” “We don’t do diagnosis,” said Zoi Marmouri, a psychologist working for Médecins Sans Frontières in Idomeni. Even if diagnosis were possible, World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines stipulate that clinical treatment is not appropriate for refugees on the move. “Therapies should not be started without assurances that there can be follow-up. You have the potential to retraumatise people,” said Claire Whitney, Middle East mental health and psychosocial support adviser at the International Medical Corps. The most effective treatments for PTSD include cognitive behaviour therapy with a trauma focus, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, as well as narrative exposure therapy. But these take time as they involve slowly exposing people to their trauma, while building up their capacity to deal with it. “It cannot be rushed,” said Whitney. “When people actually have PTSD, it is one of the most complex problems to treat.” The WHO says refugees and migrants needing diagnosis should be referred to existing non-governmental or state services. But even for those who make it into host communities, cost, stigma and language problems can lock them out of treatment. “We have serious lacks in the services we can provide. If they need hospitalisation, there aren’t any specialised units for this,” said Gionakis. International funds have been pledged for psychosocial support, although neither Britain’s Department for International Development nor the EU were able to provide a full breakdown. Some experts warn there is a risk of overdiagnosing PTSD. “They are distressed, yes, but is this PTSD? Often it will not be. These are instead normal reactions to an abnormal situation,” said Papadopoulos. The UNHCR and other agencies say much of the emotional suffering experienced by refugees and migrants is directly related to present-day stresses and concern about the future. “People live in very difficult and inhumane conditions here in camps that are too crowded. Basic needs are not met,” says Gionakis. The UNHCR advocates “psychological first aid”, which encourages those interacting with refugees to respond in a culturally sensitive and humane way that avoids distressing people further. “The humanitarian principle of ‘do no harm’ is a huge part of it,” said Whitney. “What everyone was advising, for the most part, was really to focus on the most basic kinds of support, which do contribute to mental health. Often, basic needs must be provided before people are ready – and willing – to engage with therapy.” This article was amended on 13 June 2016 to add that Harriet Zych works for Doctors of the World."
2016-08-03T13:06:15Z,UN members reject concrete refugee resettlement target,"World leaders are set to reject a concrete target for the number of refugees that should be resettled within developed countries, dashing hopes of a solution to the world’s unprecedented displacement crisis. Before a landmark conference in September, negotiators from every UN member country have failed to agree on a promise to share responsibility for 10% of the world’s refugee population, and postponed the completion of a new global refugee deal for another two years. With the number of refugees and displaced people around the world at an all-time high, campaigners had hoped that an international conference on refugees and migrants in New York would enable world leaders to agree a new mechanism for sharing refugees. Currently, 86% of refugees live in the developing world. This has led to calls for richer nations to shoulder a greater responsibility for the displacement crisis. A failure to provide refugees with legal routes to the developed world also contributed to the decision by over a million asylum seekers to travel to Europe by irregular means in 2015. But in a collective pre-summit statement completed this week, negotiators removed an earlier promise to move one in 10 refugees to the developed world, leaving only vague language that praised the principle of shared responsibility. “We intend to expand the number and range of legal pathways available for refugees to be admitted to, or resettled in, third countries,” the statement said – stopping short of any concrete numbers. Lebanon was among the countries to criticise the vague language, a source present at the negotiations said. Lebanon currently shoulders a refugee community vastly at odds with its tiny indigenous population, sheltering around 1.2 million refugees within a population of 4.5 million. In 2015, a fractionally smaller number of asylum seekers reached the European Union, which has a population of more than 500 million. The UN refugee agency nevertheless hailed the negotiations, taking strength from the fact that diplomats had at least reaffirmed the principle of resettlement, despite a toxic global discourse on migration. Volker Türk, UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection, told the Guardian: “You can look at this from a glass-half-full or glass-half-empty perspective – and for us it’s a glass-half-full.” Türk added: “In a situation where you have elections that are now won by demonising migrants and in a climate where major host countries such as Lebanon, Pakistan, Kenya and others are feeling that they don’t get the support that they need, in an environment where we have such polarised discussion at a domestic and also a regional and global level - I think it’s a minor miracle what we have seen come out as a draft for adoption. “It reaffirms the 1951 refugee convention, it reaffirms the institution of asylum, it reaffirms the principle of non-refoulement, of non-return [of refugees to dangerous environments] – and these are important legal principles that a number of politicians have in the past questioned.” But rights groups have criticised the agreement, arguing that world leaders have missed a historic chance to deal with one of the world’s most pressing crises. Audrey Gaughran, director of global issues and research for Amnesty International, said: “It’s extremely disappointing – there’s almost no responsibility shared. They have lost a huge opportunity.” Charlotte Phillips, an adviser on refugee policy at Amnesty, added: “For us this was the opportunity for leaders to show strength and courage to tackle the crisis head on – but instead what we have is a document with very little concrete in it. Given the [scale of the] global refugee crisis as it stands, that is pretty pathetic.” Other parties saw small victories in the pre-summit negotiations. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the world’s top migrant-focused aid group, is pleased that the summit will see it become formally affiliated with the UN. IOM sees this as belated but essential recognition that migration is an important enough global phenomenon to warrant its own UN agency. Leonard Doyle, IOM’s chief spokesman, said: “One could quite easily dismiss the summit, but it is, at the end of the day, very significant that the UN is finally looking at the issue of migration in some complexity. It’s high time that an organisation specialising in migration – an advocate for migration and migrants – is at the table, sharing its expertise, and given a voice.” But others still see September’s UN summit as a missed opportunity, with a decision on changes to the global refugee regime postponed to 2018. Attention now turns to another refugee-themed summit in New York scheduled for the same week in September, when leaders invited by Barack Obama will be invited to make individual resettlement pledges – as opposed to making collective ones. “Refugees can’t wait till 2018 for states to do anything remotely useful – so we’re going to push for individual states to do more, and to open up new resettlement programmes,” said Amnesty’s Gaughran, who has released a five-point resettlement plan for world leaders to consider."
2016-10-27T05:00:12Z,We damage Britain by denying its migrant past | Omar Khan,"Why has Britain’s response to the dismantling of the refugee camp in Calais been so lively – or ugly? Because it raises fundamental questions about who we are as a country. Migration is being discussed, but it’s a debate bedevilled by myth. There never was a time when Britain and the British identity was impervious to migration. Migration to Britain didn’t begin when we joined the EU. The more common but equally faulty story that Britain slowly developed organically from Anglo-Saxon roots, until the Windrush arrived from the Caribbean and changed everything, is an increasingly embarrassing sign that we simply don’t know the facts of our own history. The key economic, political and cultural events in our history – Roman Britain, the development of the English language, Magna Carta, the industrial revolution, the world wars – cannot be understood without reference to migration. Three themes resonate across the centuries. First, immigration has been intimately tied to economic innovation and growth, notably finance, trade, wool and silk production, metalworking, and of course the enslavement of Africans that helped to fund the industrial revolution. One of the best-known examples is the tens of thousands of French Protestant refugees (Huguenots) who from the 1680s onwards settled in Britain. As the historian William Pettigrew writes on the Runnymede Trust’s new website, ourmigrationstory.org.uk: “They revolutionised the textiles industries, the arts and journalism, and provided much of the hard cash for the financial revolution that took place in London in the 1690s and allowed the English state to defeat Louis XIV.” Silkweavers were perhaps most prominent in shaping the identity of Spitalfields, but they also spread to Macclesfield and Sudbury in Suffolk, where silkweaving is still practised. Second, the waves of migration were accompanied by waves of discrimination and violence against the migrants. The Narrative of the freed slave James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw reveals the extent of Britain’s links to the transatlantic slave trade, the development of British colonies, and how its connections to the Americas underpinned migration links back to Britain. During the American war of independence (1775-83), but also during the seven years’ war (1754-63) and the war of 1812 (1812-15), Britain offered freedom to any enslaved man willing to fight on its side. This was often the only way out of slavery, and following the 1772 Somerset case, formerly enslaved people were legally protected from being returned to the Americas. Gronniosaw was one of the thousands of migrants who made the journey. to Britain, and is known to us because his ‘Narrative’ went through many reprints. As Gronniosaw explains in his narrative, he met his wife, a white textile worker named Betty, and travelled with his children around the country looking for work. Historian Ryan Hanley says: “Not only did migrants like Gronniosaw experience many of the hardships common to poor people in Britain at the time, but they also had to contend with racial prejudice.” The third theme is more positive. The historical record shows how the British people and state could and would accept migrants, and that migrants generally integrate. The state’s response, as in the Letters of Denization (which gave migrants the protections of citizens), or the 1965 Race Relations Act, was often a less complete affirmation of open, inclusive definitions of our country, and more a way of defending notable and principled citizens. They have existed down the ages; think Daniel Defoe writing in 1701 (“Since scarce one family is left alive, / Which does not from some foreigner derive.”) or Gary Lineker speaking up for migrants in 2016. Because of their success, we barely acknowledge the multiple examples of migrant contribution, even the more recent ones – be they Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, or easyJet. We should better excavate that history at local levels across the country whether in public records offices, buildings, or even cemeteries and death records. Integration has most obviously occurred in the case of the Huguenots, who – along with other white European migrants – have simply been absorbed into Britishness. Will the British-born children of Polish migrants be more likely to follow this route to integration than the great-grandchildren of migrants from the Caribbean? Some groups – notably Jews, Roma, Gypsies, African and Asian people – have been continually excluded, with our society actively blocking their integration. The belief that British identity struggles to include those identified as outsiders on grounds of race or ethnicity is also supported by evidence of discrimination in the labour market and other worrying indicators of social outcomes. To the question of who we are, there is an obvious answer. We are, as we have always been, a country defined by immigration (and indeed emigration). It’s a truth we should embrace, one that will provide the best resources for our success in the 21st century, post-Brexit or otherwise. But right now that truth is elusive. It’s strange to see Germany, a country with much less history of migration and with onerous baggage from its past, appearing more confident in terms of its identity and values. Many in Britain spoke this year of “taking our country back”, asserting the importance of sovereignty and democracy in the face of European bureaucracy. But it’s equally obvious that many based those aspirations on an imaginary history. This confusion imposes a cost, as the notion of a country where people of migrant background are never truly British doesn’t just misunderstand our past, it also pushes our nation down a route towards economic stagnation and social conflict. The good news is that for the foreseeable future, where we stand in terms of identity will be at the centre of national discussion. Let that be an informed discussion. This post-EU referendum moment allows us to face up to who we have been, and to understand who we are today."
2016-10-20T19:00:09Z,UK policy to deport refugees for 'extremist behaviour' criticised,"UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit “extremist behaviour” may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation’s general assembly is to be told. In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK’s record. Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the UN’s special rapporteur on “protecting human rights while countering terrorism” since 2011. “The link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,” he is due to tell the UN session on Friday. “There is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.” Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports. Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: “The United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values. “Legislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.” His reference is to a Home Office report, Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status, published earlier this year. It states: “Extremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].” It also notes that: “Although there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.” Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: “Almost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk – they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees. “Many states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees. “Among the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.” Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which “provides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece”. He said he was concerned about the “absence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey”. Emmerson’s report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees, which details his criticisms, is on the UN’s website."
2016-12-29T18:26:45Z,Britain’s responsibility for refugee children | Letters,"As Lord Dubs has himself reflected (A hostile Europe may turn its back on child refugees, says Labour peer, 29 December), he was just one of a handful of children who were able to gain access to the UK in the late 1930s. In common with, for example, the Oxford geochronologist Professor Stephen Moorbath and actor Andrew Sachs, both of whom have died in recent months, Alf Dubs has contributed hugely to the life and welfare of the UK and all those who made their way here in flight from murder by the Third Reich went on to establish personal, family and professional lives and, as a scientific colleague said at Stephen Moorbath’s funeral, have repaid their refuge in the UK many times over. Can it really be the case that 85,000 unaccompanied, traumatised and distressed children are going to be kicked from pillar to post, spurned, left to drift, vulnerable to sexual exploitation, childhoods for ever lost? The UK government has made a pathetic token gesture and allowed in a tiny number. Now the gates are bolted shut and gatekeeper May is devoid of compassion. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Joan Smith (We are failing to help a generation of traumatised children, 28 December) will be heartened to know that the welfare of traumatised refugee children is being addressed by a new charity in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The Kalimat Foundation, which takes its name from the Arabic for “words”, takes books into refugee camps and supports trained staff who use stories to help children understand what has happened to them. The charity, which was established earlier this year by Sheikha Bodour Al Qasimi, whose father is the ruler of Sharjah, believes stories can unlock feelings and aid the journey to recovery.

2016-11-03T00:01:33Z,"EU policy leading to abuse of migrants in Italy, claims Amnesty","European migration policies have led to the alleged torture, abuse and illegal deportation of asylum seekers arriving by boat to Italy, according to dozens of migrant testimonies published for the first time. Forty Sudanese migrants were also illegally deported to Sudan without recourse to proper asylum procedures, and at least one of them – a refugee from Darfur – was beaten by officials on his return, interviewees said. The alleged abuse is the natural outcome of the EU’s new migration strategy, according to Amnesty International, which conducted the research. The implementation of the EU ‘hotspot’ system, which forces all migrants to be fingerprinted on arrival in Italy, and the failure of the EU’s relocation scheme, which has meant more refugees are housed in Italy and Greece than most EU members, has stretched Italian resources and created a dynamic that encourages abuse, Amnesty said. One Sudanese victim told the Guardian: “I saw someone tortured with electricity – I saw it with my own eyes.” The 23-year-old, who also provided testimony to Amnesty, added: “He refused to give [the police his] fingerprints, and that’s why they did it. They used Tasers.” The Italian interior ministry did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Italian officials and politicians have previously warned that the country lacks the resources to care properly for so many asylum seekers, and needs more support from its European neighbours. Since 2015, European leaders have forced Italy to register all arrivals from Libya, effectively making Italy responsible for their care, without welcoming any themselves. Just 1,200 refugees have been formally relocated from Italy to other European countries out of the 40,000 whom EU members initially promised to absorb. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, threatened last week to veto the disbursement of EU funds to countries that failed to welcome refugees from Italy. “Italy cannot take another year like the one we’ve just had,” Renzi said. Amnesty’s lead researcher on the project, Matteo De Bellis, said: “The hotspot approach, designed in Brussels and executed in Italy, has increased, not decreased, the pressure on frontline states. It is resulting in appalling violations of the rights of desperately vulnerable people for which the Italian authorities bear a direct responsibility and Europe’s leaders a political one.” The vast majority of incoming migrants appear to have been treated in a humane manner by Italian police. The Italian navy and coastguard also play an instrumental role in the rescue of hundreds of thousands of stricken asylum seekers in the southern Mediterranean. But the testimonies released on Thursday reveal that several officials, under pressure to fingerprint uncooperative asylum seekers, and to stem migration numbers, have abused people and returned them to dangerous situations without allowing them to apply for asylum. One 27-year-old victim alleged that policemen in Sicily beat and Tasered him before using a pair of three-pronged pliers on his naked testicles. “I was on a chair made of aluminium, with an opening on the seat,” he told Amnesty, in testimony also confirmed by a second victim. “They held [my] shoulders and legs, took my testicles with the pliers, and pulled twice. I can’t say how painful it was.” A 16-year-old from Darfur told Amnesty that he was electrocuted after he tried to resist being fingerprinted. “They gave me electricity with a stick, many times on the left leg, then on right leg, chest and belly,” he was quoted as saying. “I was too weak, I couldn’t resist and at that point they took both my hands and put them on the machine.” A Darfurian man deported to Sudan in August told the Guardian he was expelled despite telling policemen that he wished to apply for asylum. “I told them I wanted political asylum in Italy,” he said by telephone. “But I’m not sure the translator translated this.” The dangers of his illegal deportation became apparent on his arrival in Sudan. At least one returnee was beaten by Sudanese security officials during his interrogation, the man said. “He was dragged on the floor, and hit with a chair. We were in the same room, and he was next to me. I don’t [know] why they did it.” The Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, has been charged by the international criminal court with three counts of genocide in Darfur. The Guardian has asked the Sudanese government for comment. Additional reporting: Eiad Abdullatif"
2016-03-11T18:19:55Z,Greece rules out using force against migrants and refugees,"The Greek government has announced it will have reception centres with a capacity to host 50,000 people ready next week as figures showed the number of refugees and migrants in the country has passed 42,000. The country’s leftist-led coalition, racing against the clock to deal with the massive influx, ruled out using force to relocate more than 12,000 men, women and children stranded in increasingly wretched conditions on the Greek-Macedonian border. Instead, it said it hoped the people who are trapped in a waterlogged camp where sanitation facilities have deteriorated and illness has become rife would understand that Europe’s Balkan corridor had been closed and choose to settle in organised shelters. “We have to persuade them [to move] and we can’t do that using teargas,” said the deputy public order minister, Nikos Toskas. “Half the people there are women and children.” Authorities handed out fliers urging refugees to leave the sprawling tent city that has sprung up around Idomeni because there “is no hope” they can continue their journey north into Europe following the decision of Macedonia and other Balkan states to seal the route. Earlier this week, more than 14,000 people – including a baby boy born in a mud-clad tent to a Syrian refugee on Sunday – were caught in limbo as a result of the border closures. With debt-stricken Greece being tested to its limits by the crisis, the European Union pledged to expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. Seen as the easiest gateway into the 28-member bloc, Greece has been on the frontline of the emergency since hundreds of thousands of people began seeking refuge on the continent after fleeing conflict and poverty in Syria and elsewhere. “We have a moral duty as Europeans to offer this help to refugees,” the EU’s leading humanitarian aid policy maker, Christos Stylianides, told reporters after holding talks in Athens with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. “I want to be clear: Greece is not alone in these difficult times.” Disaster relief of the sort normally distributed to developing nations has been earmarked for the myriad NGOs working out of the country under a €700m (£540m) EU aid programme announced last week. The package is due to be given the green light on Tuesday before being sent to the European parliament for further endorsement. “The humanitarian crisis that we currently have in Idomeni is not a Greek matter, it is a European matter and we should all face it together,” Tsipras said after the meeting. He said the overstretched state apparatus, which is preparing holding facilities for 10,000 people every week, should receive financial support. Despite the contours of an agreement being reached with Turkey at an emergency EU summit to stem the flows on Monday, increasing numbers of migrants and refugees are continuing to make the often perilous journey to Greece’s Aegean isles. By Friday, 42,253 were inside the country, according to Athens, including 864 who landed on Greek shores on Thursday and about 1,600 who reached the Aegean island of Chios on Wednesday. Announcing that the time had come to focus on the smuggling rings behind the illicit flows, the deputy defence minister Dimitris Vitsa, who is coordinating the Greek government’s response to the crisis, told Star TV: “We have to turn our eyes to traffickers [in Turkey] … because it is they who are selling false hope to people.”"
2016-12-15T12:47:48Z,EU claims of success in curbing Niger migrants greeted with scepticism,"The EU has hailed a plunge in the number of migrants crossing Niger to reach Europe as a success for its anti-trafficking strategy, even as MEPs complained that the bloc’s figures did not add up. The volume of migrants making the perilous journey across Niger’s desert fell from 70,000 in May to 1,500 in November, according to an EU statement released on Wednesday. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc’s funding of anti-migration measures in Africa was creating “positive results and important building blocks for new cooperation”. The Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipila, has called for the scheme to be extended to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. At an EU summit on Thursday, an announcement of thousands more “voluntary assisted returns” to Libya is expected. But doubts about the probity of the figures for Niger cast a shadow over Wednesday’s announcement. The declared drop in migrants crossing Niger is based on an assessment of just two monitoring points, and data that “does not reflect overall entries or exits to and from Niger”. That assessment – by the International Organisation for Migration – also suggests that migrants are avoiding key towns and transit points in Niger “for fear of repression”, casting further doubt on what EU officials had described as “a success story” for EU policy. The Green MEP Judith Sargentini branded the European commission’s claim to have reduced migrant numbers in Niger as being “at least questionable, if not harmful for migrants”. She said: “EU support for Niger’s border guards has made people smuggling even more profitable, as the prices of people smuggling rise due to increased border guards. Meanwhile, proposals for legal pathways for refugees and economic migrants are nowhere to be seen. In all aspects, this is a failing approach.” Many migrants are thought to have travelled north through Niger to Libya, from where human smugglers ferry them to Italy on ramshackle boats. Sargentini, a member of the European parliament’s development committee, pointed out that more people had died in the Mediterranean Sea this year than in 2015, and said that the EU’s pride at trends in Niger was misplaced. “If the EU really did reduce the number of people transiting through that country, where are those people now, and what state are they in?” she asked. Senior EU officials insist it is too early to conclude that traffickers have diverted their routes via neighbouring Mali to avoid detection by EU-trained border guards. But one said that the bloc was “starting to see circumstantial evidence” of this. By early next year, the EU wants to sign agreements linking aid to migration restrictions with five African countries – Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia. EU officials will then be deployed in these countries to help with measures such as the biometric registration of migrants passing through. In a progress report for Senegal, EU sources say “a lot of work has to be done on the root causes of migration”, although they are hopeful of progress in Nigeria, where the readmission of deported EU migrants began in October. In total, 4,430 people have been repatriated from Europe under the migration pacts so far, and a further 2,700 people have been returned to priority countries. However, Raphael Shilhav, Oxfam’s EU migration adviser, said the policy had been short-sighted in its depiction of migration as a negative phenomenon. “Migration is an important tool for development in western Africa and a vital coping mechanism for displaced peoples,” he said. “In the Lake Chad basin, we have millions of people displaced – including across borders – and an EU intervention to close down borders is problematic. These people need humanitarian assistance.” Many NGOs and MEPs complain that existing development aid pledges are being diverted towards projects aimed at stemming migration. There are no reliable figures for how much of the contribution that EU countries make to a €2.5bn Africa Trust fund linked to migration curbs comes from existing development aid budgets. “You can’t say that it is new [money],” said one EU official. “It may be additional funding that is being mobilised for this purpose.”"
2016-11-24T19:00:41Z,What do we know about the Central American refugee deal between the US and Australia? | Jiyoung Song,"Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced Australia’s participation in the US-led program to resettle Central American refugees from a Costa Rican camp after attending President Obama’s leaders’ summit on refugees in September. Aside from a surprise in Costa Rica at his announcement, little attention has been given to the details of this new policy or about the camp itself. This is particularly notable now, with Turnbull’s reiterated immigration policy not to settle any illegal maritime arrivals. Many of the central American refugees will have crossed their borders “illegally” via overland “coyotes”. Though critics might concentrate on whether this announcement was Turnbull’s price of entry to the summit or even speculate it is part of a long-executed agenda to woo power player America, it is important to unpack and understand what this new decision means tangibly for the migrants and us in Australia. So, what do we know about the camp in Costa Rica? What is the US-led humanitarian migration program? What are they fleeing from? And after all, what does this mean for Australia? The US-led humanitarian program in Costa Rica People have been fleeing serious gang violence in the northern triangle of Central America (NTCA) – El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Honduras, for example, is the second most dangerous country to live after Syria as gang members target young boys to recruit, destroy businesses and abuse girls and women. Honduras’s murder rate is the highest in the world at 90.4 homicides per 100,000 in 2013, according to the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. The world’s average is 6.2. Armed gang members are destroying local businesses. The police or law enforcement does not deliver criminal justice. No rule of law is in proper place. Highly corrupt governments fail to protect its citizens. Gang violence is not strictly covered by the 1951 Refugee Convention. Migrants fleeing from gang violence fear their safety back home but they do not face “state” persecution. However, corrupt officials involved in violence can justify the failure to protect their citizens, therefore it is indirect state persecution by non-action. Critics in the US also said granting NTCA migrants a refugee status was a redefinition of a refugee. But the Obama administration acknowledged the urgency of this humanitarian crisis where innocent children were targeted by gang members. Violence has detrimental long-term side effects. Poverty, economic stagnation, and malfunctioning public services, including hospitals and schools, are indirect consequences of the state failure to guarantee public safety and personal security. Furthermore, severe droughts have worsened the conditions in Central America. Even worse, there was Hurricane Matthew in September 2016. The flows of humanitarian migrants fleeing from violence, poverty and natural disasters are likely to continue and grow. Women and children are particularly vulnerable. Unaccompanied minors and mothers with children have been crossing borders to the US and Mexico. Early this year, the Obama administration announced it would work with the UNHCR and IOM to process refugees from Central America, on top of the in-country program opened in December 2015. At the regional level, the high-level roundtable among nine countries in North and Central Americas concluded a series of comprehensive recommendations in San José, to address the plight of people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras (San Jose Action Statement). In July, the government of Costa Rica entered into a Protection Transfer Arrangement (PTA) with the UNHCR and the IOM to receive applicants most in need of immediate protection after pre-screening by the US government in their countries of origin. Costa Rica’s refugees from the Northern Triangle of Central America According to the UNHCR, there were 1,830 new applications registered in Costa Rica in 2015, which was a 60% increase from 2014. Among them, 890 were from the NTCA, a 127% increase from the previous year. Most NTCA migrants are Christian. In Honduras, 47% are Roman Catholic and another 41% are Protestant. In El Salvador, 57% are Catholic and 21% are Protestant. In El Salvador, abortion is subject to jail terms even when pregnancy is caused by rape and the pregnant woman is under age. Same in Guatemala. 87% are Christian. The PTA is an innovative emergency resettlement mechanism that can process up to 200 individuals at heightened risk. It has undergone its initial pilot phase. First beneficiaries come from El Salvador and are being relocated to the US. Discussions are under way with potential additional transit and destination countries. This includes Australia. Concerns over integration and public health The main reason Central American refugees want to go to the US is that it’s the richest country in their region where they already have families and friends to rely on. They find jobs, schools, and survival tips through these social networks which is an important pull factor for migrants. For this reason, even Costa Rica is not easy for them to integrate successfully. Australia may be an attractive place for Central American refugees, but it’s far away from their countries of origin across the Pacific where they may not necessarily have the networks to support them. For refugees’ smooth transition and successful integration, they need co-ethnic community and businesses to offer jobs for their self-reliance and successful integration. Governments alone can’t support newly arriving migrants who may end up relying on government subsidies. They need community support and engagement. Spread of Zika raises another serious concern for those travelling across Central America. Zika has been categorised as a pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation, which causes birth defects in babies born to mothers with the virus. Cases were reported in 20 countries in Central America, including the Northern Triangle. The prevalence of gang violence and the absence of proper public health systems in the region make it difficult for health professionals to reach patients and eradicate the disease. If the virus spreads further in the region, migration flows would increase. What it means for Australia When questioned by journalists at the September summit in New York,Turnbull denied that there was a “people swap” deal with the US taking refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. After two months, the government announced a new US deal to transfer some of the detainees from Nauru and Manus to the US. It’s difficult not to think of it as a swap deal. Not a 1-1 refugee swap but a bundle swap. We still don’t know what’s in the bundle. Now with Trump winning the election and implementing the deal (or no deal), the faith of refugees in both camps looks quite bleak. He may think it’s not a fair deal to swap Muslim refugees from Nauru with Christian minors from Costa Rica. Turnbull is renegotiating with Malaysia, calling the Cambodia deal a success. Instead of speculating unknown details of the Australian-US deal over vulnerable populations across the Pacific, however, we need to think about the consequences of this policy decision in the regional context. What we do know is that, as of September 2016, they are 1,269 detainees, including 45 children, in Nauru and Papua New Guinea who are mostly genuine refugees. They won’t be settled in Australia but will be sent to the US. The swap deal sounds like an ideologically-trapped solution to a very simple problem in a lengthy, expensive and complicated manner. Every refugee counts – whether they are onshore, offshore or far away across the Pacific. For some, this new policy is a surprising opportunity. Unfortunately, for others, Australia will never be a welcoming new home, no matter how close they are already."
2016-04-04T13:33:30Z,First boats returning migrants and refugees from Greece arrive in Turkey,"Three boats carrying the first migrants to be deported from Greece to Turkey under an EU deal with Ankara have made the short journey across the Aegean Sea to the Turkish port of Dikili. Two boats carrying 131 deportees arrived from Lesbos. A third, carrying 66 people, came from the nearby island of Chios. Under the deal with the EU, Ankara is supposed take back all migrants and refugees who enter Greece illegally, including Syrians, in return for the EU taking in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and rewarding it with more money, early visa-free travel and progress in its EU membership negotiations. Officials from the EU border agency Frontex said the Lesbos boats were carrying mostly Pakistanis who were already being deported to Turkey before the deal’s creation. As such Monday’s deportations are not a true test of whether the agreement can stop the flow of mainly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis to Greece. EU authorities said none of those deported on Monday had requested asylum in Greece and all had left voluntarily. The Greek civil protection ministry said there were two Syrians on board one of the boats from Lesbos, both of whom had asked to be sent back.The deportations on Lebsos were calmly carried out at dawn, several hours ahead of schedule. Many deportees carried backpacks. None waved to the few photographers gathered on the quay. Volunteers on Chios alleged that they saw police beating deportees at the quay. The first boat to moor in Dikili was a chartered Turkish catamaran, the Nazli Jale. Frontex officials inside the boat wore masks. Disembarkation was delayed while officials erected a white tarpaulin on the boat to block the media’s view. Migrants deported to Turkey will be sent to the area in which they first registered their arrival, or if they did not register, to a detention camp in the north-west of the country. Several registration tents have been erected on the quay at Dikili, where there is a heavy police presence. Officials took down a huge banner next to the quay that said the citizens of Dikili opposed the refugees’ arrival . Local opponents of the deal claim 4,000 people have signed a petition of complaint. “Dikili is very small – just 40,000 citizens,” said Emirhan Çekun, as he asked passersby to sign the petition. “We cannot fit the refugees.” Elsewhere on the Turkish coast, people were photographed being arrested by coastguards as they attempted to reach Greece, suggesting that some remain undeterred by the deportations. Greek authorities took many by surprise deploying buses to pick up the deportees from the Moria detention camp on Lesbos at the crack of dawn. While Monday’s operation appeared to have gone smoothly, it remained far from certain when more would be expelled from the island. “I hate to say this but they were easy cases,” said Eva Moncure, a Frontex spokeswoman. “I really cannot tell you when the next readmission will happen.” The vast majority of the 2,800 detainees in Moria have applied for asylum, which will inevitably delay the process as their requests are examined and heard. Most are Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans. “What we know is that 90% of [those in] the Moria camps have applied for asylum,” said Lieutenant Zacharia Tsirigoti, who runs the Greek department for refugees. Protesters – many volunteers who have been on the island for months – held placards deploring what they described as a “dirty deal”. “EU shame on you! No borders, no nations, stop the dirty deportations,” they chanted on the harbour side. “This is an appalling deal. What we are hearing from authorities is that no one [on the boats] wanted to apply for asylum but the question is how do we know?” said Steffi De Pous, a Dutch volunteer on the island. “These people risked their lives to get here. Were they given the right information? Did they know their rights?” Volunteers, she said, had decided to go to Moria with megaphones to “let them know what their rights are so that they are not bullied into this process”. In Dikili, alongside residents opposing the presence of refugees, several refugee campaigners arrived to express their support for those being deported. Some carried a banner that said: “Stop deportations, open the borders.” Baran Doğan, a refugee rights campaigner from Izmir, the regional capital, said: “This is the bargaining and bartering of human bodies – it’s treating humans as goods.” He added that Turkey should not be considered a safe country for refugees since there is a war in the south-east of the country, frequent bomb attacks elsewhere and no labour rights for Syrians. “In reality there are no legal jobs for them,” said Doğan. Another campaigner, Idil Gökber, from Refugee Volunteers of Izmir, said Europe needed to help Turkey with its refugee burden. “I welcome the refugees,” said Gökber. “But 3-4% of the Turkish population are Syrian refugees so we have to share them [with Europe]. If only Turkey takes these refugees, it’ll be bad for them, and also for us.” The EU-Turkey deal was struck in March as Europe wrestled with the continent’s worst migration crisis since the second world war, with more than 1 million people arriving last year. Under the agreement, designed to halt new arrivals along the most popular route through Turkey, all “irregular migrants” arriving since 20 March face being sent back. Each case is meant to be examined individually. For every Syrian refugee returned, another Syrian refugee will be resettled from Turkey to the EU, with numbers capped at 72,000. The first Syrians to be resettled in Europe under the exchange deal arrived in Germany on Monday morning. Two planes each carrying 16 Syrian refugees touched down from Istanbul in the northern city of Hanover, according to Germany’s federal refugee office. The refugees were taken by bus to a reception camp about 90 miles away in Friedland near Göttingen. More than 52,000 men, women and children are now stranded in Greece following the decisions of Balkan countries to close their borders. Police sources on Lesbos on Sunday said there had been a flurry of last-minute asylum applications among the 3,300 migrants there. Many people have complained of not being given sufficient time and access to the asylum procedure, which is under “insufferable pressure” according to senior asylum officials in Athens. Screening people, processing requests and hearing appeals in as little as two weeks, leaves the door wide open to error. Last week, Greece’s top asylum official admitted the bankrupt country would require a 20-fold increase in personnel to cope with the extra burden. Promised staff reinforcements in the form of about 2,300 legal experts, asylum practitioners and translators from the EU have yet to arrive. Anas al-Bakhr, a Syrian engineer from Homs who is among those stuck on Chios, said police marked his arrival date as 20 March – when the deal came into force – even though he arrived the day before. “They said the computers were broken that day,” he said.

2016-09-21T17:01:13Z,Where Theresa May’s stance on refugees takes us | Letters,"Theresa May posturing to the UN on uncontrolled migration (May refuses to take more Syrian refugees, 20 September) was a little bit like a serial adulterer giving a lecture on the merits of fidelity in marriage. I’m surprised she didn’t get bottled off stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8 million had fled Syria. More than that fled Afghanistan during the UK’s period of intervention. Surprisingly, dropping bombs upon people causes them to run away. Perhaps Mrs May should dwell upon that fact, rather than lecturing the UN about the differences between refugees and economic migrants. Paul Dodenhoff Leyland, Lancashire • The “polite and gentle” boy killed attempting to climb on to a lorry last Friday (Report, 20 September) could have been the child I met while volunteering in the Calais migrant camp last month. I was teaching English, as part of Care4Calais’s outreach scheme. He was small for his age and his eyes were red with tiredness and tear gas. He explained that each night he climbed trees in order to jump down on to the lorries. He would cut the tarpaulin in a vain attempt to evade the heat sensors and sniffer dogs. Each night he would be returned to the camp, often after a beating from the police. Walls and fences will not keep desperate people out (including unaccompanied children); surely we have a moral responsibility to at the very least let the children in. There must be no more deaths. Simon Shaw Vice president, Redbridge Teachers’ Association • Patrick Kingsley (Opinion, 20 September) knows more than most what Theresa May’s asylum/refugee policies are all about: keep them out. This guided her through her Home Office days. She could reflect on what is happening in Canada, where Justin Trudeau’s government has settled 30,000 Syrians, mostly families, mostly welcomed and sponsored by Canadian families. In the UK many people have offered to do the same, but Mrs May won’t allow this to happen, even when people have offered full housing and financial support. Doesn’t matter what is happening in Syria or elsewhere – “keep them out and leave it to others” is the voice inside Mrs May’s head, a voice not susceptible to humanitarian considerations. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • The real challenge facing world leaders attending President Obama’s summit on refugees (Report, 19 September) is tackling the root causes of migration, not just the effects. By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking plaster rather than a cure. Even more concerning is the UK’s involvement in the so-called Khartoum process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan’s refugees from reaching Libya and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan’s record of ethnically cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek sanctuary – and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan’s government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, they would be more likely to stay there. By too often appeasing Sudan’s leaders, we have guaranteed that thousands of Sudanese will continue to seek refuge with their former colonial rulers. Olivia Warham Director, Waging Peace"
2016-11-28T12:27:22Z,2016 sets new record for asylum seekers reaching Italy by boat,"More asylum seekers have now reached Italy by boat in 2016 than in any previous year on record. Nearly 171,000 people have arrived in Italy from north Africa since the start of the year, according to statistics compiled by the UN refugee agency and the Italian government. As of Monday, the total had surpassed the previous record of 170,000, set in 2014. Migration flows in the eastern Mediterranean between Turkey and Greece have been drastically reduced after improvements in Turkish policing, increased threats of deportation from Greece, and the closure of a humanitarian corridor between Greece and Germany. But Europe’s deterrent strategy has failed to cut migration in the central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy, with the Italian route once again becoming the main migrant gateway into Europe. European navies, including Britain’s, have focused on a military-style response, sending frigates to arrest smugglers in international waters. Libyan smugglers have responded by sending passengers on board inflatable dinghies that are piloted by migrants themselves, reducing smugglers’ exposure to arrest and allowing their business to continue as normal. The Libyan civil war has weakened the country’s law enforcement agencies, some of whom are complicit in the smuggling, leaving European governments without viable Libyan partners in their fight against migration. The chaos there also gives migrants more incentive to leave for Europe; in previous years they could more easily find work and stability in Libya. Pressure on transit countries in the Sahara desert, through which many African migrants pass before reaching Libya, has had no effect. Flows through Niger, the country to Libya’s south, increased in 2016, despite Niger introducing new anti-smuggling laws at the request of the EU. Displacement in north-east Nigeria, where 1.4 million people have been forced to flee Boko Haram, may contribute to sustained levels of migration towards Europe in the future. The numbers coming to Europe are nevertheless insignificant compared with flows within Africa itself. Just 3.3% of the world’s displaced Africans have reached Europe. More than 93% remain within their home continent. The majority of migrants bound for Italy are fleeing poverty, wars and dictatorships in Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan and the Gambia. Syrians no longer use the Libyan route. The breakdown of law and order has significantly worsened living conditions for foreign workers in Libya since 2011. Many report conditions tantamount to slave labour, while hundreds have been kidnapped for ransom, and sometimes tortured. A recent survey of new arrivals in Italy by the International Organisation for Migration found that 70% of respondents had been exploited to some degree during their journey to Europe. Other recent IOM research shows that the majority had not intended to travel to Europe when leaving home, but had been forced to change their destinations due to extenuating circumstances such as the Libyan civil war."
2016-09-13T09:38:50Z,"Expel Hungary from EU for hostility to refugees, says Luxembourg","Luxembourg’s foreign minister has called for Hungary to be thrown out of the European Union over its increasingly hostile approach to refugees, as campaigners accuse Viktor Orbán’s hardline government of whipping up xenophobia to block a European plan to relocate asylum seekers. Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be temporarily or even permanently expelled from the EU for treating asylum seekers “worse than wild animals”. In an interview with German daily Die Welt, he said: “Anyone who, like Hungary, builds fences against refugees from war or who violates press freedom and judicial independence should be excluded temporarily, or if necessary for ever, from the EU.” Asselborn called for EU rules to be changed to make it easier to expel Hungary as this was “the only way of preserving the cohesion and values of the European Union”. Hungary’s foreign affairs and trade minister Péter Szijjártó dismissed Asselborn as “an intellectual lightweight” and his comments as “sermonising, pompous and frustrated”. He said only Hungarians have the right to decide who they wish to live with, adding that no Brussels bureaucrat can deprive them of this right. In a statement issued by the Hungarian government, Szijjártó added: “It is somewhat curious that Jean Asselborn and Jean-Claude Juncker – who both come from the country of tax optimisation – speak about jointly sharing burdens. But we understand what this really means: Hungary should take on the burden created by the mistakes of others.” Human Rights Watch also called on Europe to use its “enforcement powers” against Budapest after documenting abuse of asylum seekers that it says breaches Hungary’s legal obligations under European and international law. It is also alarmed by an anti-migrant campaign orchestrated by Orbán’s government to resist an attempt to impose binding quotas for resettling asylum seekers in member states. On 2 October, Hungary is due to hold a controversial referendum on the relocation plan, which involves sending 1,294 asylum seekers to Hungary. Orbán’s government has sent an 18-page booklet to millions of Hungarian households urging citizens to reject the plan because it says “forced settlement endangers our culture and traditions”. Lydia Gall, HRW’s Budapest-based researcher on eastern Europe, dismissed the booklet as “government sponsored xenophobic anti-refugee propaganda rubbish”. She accused the EU of being “virtually silent” in the face of such rhetoric. But she said Asselborn’s call to expel Hungary from the EU would “probably do more harm than good”. In an email to the Guardian, Gall said Hungary should instead be prosecuted. She wrote: “The EU has good tools to address human rights problems in member states. The focus, rather, should be on generating the political will to use those mechanisms to hold Hungary to account including, if necessary, through the court of justice.” Hungary’s booklet includes an image of migrants and asylum seekers queuing to enter Europe, similar to the much-criticised “Breaking Point” poster launched by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage during Britain’s EU referendum campaign. The headline above the image of the queue says: “We have a right to decide who we want to live with”, according to a translation by the Budapest Beacon. Gall said Hungary’s booklet was worse than the Ukip poster. She said: “While the Ukip poster was revolting, it doesn’t compare to the anti-migrant and anti-refugee campaign in Hungary in terms of scale.” In a blogpost, she added: “The booklet contains distorted facts about Europe’s refugee crisis, portraying asylum seekers and migrants as dangerous to Europe’s future. It links migration to increased terrorism and refers to non-existent ‘no-go’ areas in European cities with large migrant populations, including London, Paris and Berlin, where authorities have allegedly lost control and where law and order is absent.” She added: “Sixty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Hungarians obtained sanctuary from persecution in other parts of Europe and North America. If the Hungarian government reminded itself and Hungarians about that history, it might help create a more positive and welcoming attitude towards those from Syria and elsewhere seeking safety in Hungary today.” Hungary’s hardline rhetoric on refugees left it isolated during the peak of the refugee crisis in September 2015, but in the year since, Orbán has become an increasingly pivotal figure in European policy. Austria, which initially followed Germany by responding compassionately to refugees, now stands with Hungary in calling for an Australian-style solution to the refugee crisis. “In September, Orbán was the bad guy,” Gerald Knaus, head of the Berlin-based thinktank the European Stability Initiative, told the Guardian earlier this month. “Yet by the end of the year he was the leader of a coalition of states. And with Austria now taking the lead on arguing for an Australian-style system, it’s now Germany that is isolated.” But Orbán’s vision goes far beyond simply repelling immigrants. In a speech made last year, Orbán hailed what he saw as the demise of liberal Europe. “We are experiencing now the end of an era: a conceptual-ideological era,” Orbán told supporters last autumn. “Putting pretension aside, we can simply call this the era of liberal babble. This era is now at an end.” A week ago, Orbán continued this argument at a press conference with the rightwing Polish politician Jarosław Kaczyński, in which he called for Europe and its institutions to be reworked in favour of a rightwing vision. “We are at a historic cultural moment,” said Orbán. “There is a possibility of a cultural counter-revolution right now.”"
2016-10-31T07:00:11Z,Refugees aren’t the problem. Europe’s identity crisis is | Natalie Nougayrède,"Immigration is likely to remain an overarching theme in European politics. And for a long time yet. It was at the heart of the UK referendum campaign (although this concerned mostly intra-EU migration), and it is set to dominate French and German elections next year (focusing on immigration from outside Europe). In the summer of 2015 Angela Merkel predicted that migration and asylum would “in the future preoccupy” Europe “much, much more” than financial issues have done. One year on, there is little reason to dispute this. A record 3,800 people have perished in the Mediterranean since the beginning of this year, according to the United Nations. Europe may have closed off the Aegean and Balkan routes, but more people are drowning than ever before in the central Mediterranean desperately trying to reach Italy. The migration issue has shaped political discourse in Europe, and is likely to continue to shape it. On one side are liberal internationalists attached to fundamental asylum principles or to the dream of a borderless world; on the other are xenophobic fence-builders who see migration as a modern version of barbaric invasions threatening culture and civilisation. The latter, alas, tend to hold sway. One of the collateral damages of post-truth politics is that not only the present gets distorted – the past gets rewritten as well. Racist videos online depict fantasies of Europe “before” and “after” migration. “Before” is depicted with orderly scenes of 1950s streets, shops and parks where an all-white population strolls or plays happily. “After” is groups of dark-faced men attacking women, rioting against the police, shouting “Allahu Akbar”. The essential narrative of bigots is that our European world is collapsing under the onslaught of mass arrivals from cultures that we cannot possibly mingle with. In France, a theory called the “great replacement” has spread to large parts of the right and certainly the far-right. It states that, as a result of immigration, the nation’s core population is set to be replaced by non-European outsiders who will wreck the country’s identity. There are also echoes of this in Germany’s Pegida movement, whose full name is “Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the west”. Debunking these myths can be hard work. Hatred and passions overtake rational approaches and documented facts get swept away. It is even harder when Europe’s long history of almost constant population movement and mixing of cultures is ignored, untaught or forgotten. For example, it’s often said that the arrival of Arabs and Muslims in France started when post-second world war reconstruction efforts required a new labour force, or after Algeria became independent in 1962. Yet Algerians (especially from Kabylie) have been in France for at least a century. The French historian Benjamin Stora says the real challenge of immigration is “the challenge of knowing the other” – and it goes both ways. The 2015 refugee crisis has held up a mirror to Europeans: it’s forced them to ask themselves who they are, how they define themselves and their actions. The 1.3 million people who reached the continent last year represented only 0.2% of the EU’s total population. It should have been manageable. Germany alone took in roughly 800,000. That’s equivalent to 1% of its own population, and is the same number it absorbed in 1992 when people fled the Balkan wars and ethnic Germans left the former Soviet Union.. If there was a crisis in 2015, it had less to do with the refugees – who knew what they were fleeing and where they wanted to go – and much more to do more with European governments and societies who did not all step up to the plate. In fact, Europe isn’t confronted with a refugee and migrant crisis. It’s the refugees and migrants who are confronted with a crisis of Europe. The scandal is that, in the Mediterranean, they have been paying with their lives. Demographers point out that the pivotal migration year for Europe was 2014. That’s when Europe for the first time surpassed the US as a destination for immigrants, according to the French demographer François Héran. Around 1.9 million legal immigrants came to the EU (population 508 million) and 1 million to the US (population 319 million). With that, the European ratio became 3.7 legal immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants, while the US’s was 3.1. This is the new, transformative reality many Europeans have yet to acknowledge. Historically, Europe exported its population, whether to distant colonial possessions for conquest and domination, or to the New World as a consequence of poverty, persecution or war. Now, it has become the foremost magnet and refuge for those who seek safety and a better life. We are simply much richer and more stable than many other parts of the world. And our diversity is set to grow, but not in the “great replacement” scenario. Europe needs immigration as an injection of youth and dynamism if in the decades to come it wants to address its workforce and pension problems. Europeans were once the huddled masses on boats reaching Ellis Island, in New York, or Pier 21 in Halifax, Canada’s gateway for immigrants – both now museums. I visited Pier 21 a few years ago, and spent some time looking at pictures of Hungarian refugees who had fled the repression of the 1956 Budapest uprising and celebrated their arrival. Perhaps Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s self-avowedly “illiberal” prime minister, who shuns refugees, should take a look. Perhaps other European politicians should too. Canada and the US are countries whose creation derived from the movement of people to faraway shores; European nations are rooted otherwise. But Europe could draw inspiration from the capacity to form a positive narrative that embraces migration instead of treating it mainly as a threat. Europe, as the new continent of immigration, will increasingly need that narrative."
2016-12-09T12:21:28Z,Please help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal,"The plight of child refugees is at the heart of this year’s Guardian and Observer charity appeal. We supported refugees last year and we are proud to return to this theme again. It remains the great humanitarian crisis of our times. The political mood has hardened around immigration, and in a volatile world the tragedy of forced migration can seem less visible. Yet the reality is inescapable: in Europe, thousands of children are stuck in squalid camps or sleeping rough, caught up in political turmoil beyond their control and exposed to multiple dangers. This year, record numbers of children have drowned in the Mediterranean; others have been placed in detention for travelling without documents. Official figures indicate more than 90,000 children have travelled alone, fleeing war and destitution across Europe. Charities believe the real figure is higher, because so many have slipped beneath the radar. The Guardian and Observer have consistently reported the dire conditions faced by many children: the rat-infested camps, the unheated squats and the muddy ditches that they are forced to call home. We’ve published interviews with children of primary school age, travelling without parents, worried about how to feed themselves and how to get to safety. Child refugees running from war and violent unrest in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan have told us Europe can seem an unwelcoming place. Many are shocked to find themselves living in camps that may be safe from bombs, but where conditions are far worse than what they were used to at home. Most despair at being stuck in limbo, unable to continue their education, wasting their lives. They risk disease, trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. Let’s be clear: without help, some will not survive the winter. The UK government’s response has been muted. It has resisted efforts to allow child refugees to be reunited with families in the UK, and delayed attempts to give shelter to the most vulnerable children travelling alone. The major aid agencies are clear that the UK has not accepted its fair share. The issue provokes both weariness and hostility from many in Britain; some find it convenient to conflate asylum seekers with economic migrants, and adopt a less than welcoming approach. Child refugees have been criticised for not looking sufficiently young. Our view has not changed from last year. The political solutions to the refugee crisis may be complex, but that does not mean we should abandon our humanity. We should not close our hearts, retreat behind walls, real or imagined, or ignore the pressing moral imperative to provide assistance and sanctuary for some of the world’s most desperate people. Guardian and Observer readers last year demonstrated extraordinary solidarity with refugees. Through our 2015 appeal you showed in your thousands that a more compassionate voice exists amid the rancour. You signalled a wish for a more tolerant, empathetic, kinder society. Above all, you showed amazing generosity: last year’s appeal raised an astonishing £2.6m for refugee charities. This year we are asking readers to donate to three fantastic charities that offer practical and effective help and support to child refugees, whether they are travelling alone or with families, or have already arrived in the UK. All combine a passionate entrepreneurialism with a dynamic commitment to social justice. Help Refugees brings a refreshing vitality and energy to the provision of emergency humanitarian aid. Set up just 16 months ago by a group of friends wondering what they could do to help refugees, it has grown to become one of Europe’s largest distributors of food, clothes, shelter and medicine to refugees, supporting over 50 projects across the continent. Safe Passage is another new project, created by the Citizens UK charity last year to help provide legal support to hundreds of unaccompanied refugee children, so that they can apply for asylum in the UK – many of them to be reunited with family members resident here – rather than risking their lives smuggling themselves in on lorries. Once refugee children are in the UK, adapting to their new surroundings can be a lonely and demoralising experience. A series of projects run by The Children’s Society provide a range of services from legal advice to help youngsters access education and housing, to language lessons, social activities and mentoring. The aim is to help youngsters overcome the trauma of migration, and to support them to rebuild their lives. Guardian and Observer journalists will over the next few weeks highlight the vital work of our three charities through words, pictures, and film, both online and in our newspapers. We have been inspired by them and their work, and we hope you will be too. Help us once again to show solidarity with refugees. Please give generously. • Support the three chosen charities by donating here"
2016-09-19T19:23:28Z,Theresa May isn’t interested in refugees’ welfare. She just wants fewer of them in Britain | Patrick Kingsley,"New and more effective. That’s how Theresa May describes the migration policy she proposed to the world on Monday ahead of the UN general assembly . The prime minister wants to combat migration by helping more refugees to stay in the first country they reach; by distinguishing better between people fleeing war, and those fleeing poverty; and by giving countries more licence to protect their borders by force, or with a fence. Wrapped within this three-part plan is the implicit idea that it is better to enable developing countries than to offer sanctuary to the refugees stuck in them. In the global context, May’s comments are something of a sideshow; a British leader’s interventions in world affairs arguably matter less today than at any stage in the past few centuries. But it’s useful to examine May’s vision. In short: it is neither particularly effective, nor new. The first plank of her plan – the suggestion that more refugees should be encouraged to stay in the first country they reach – is not a new idea. This is the status quo – and the situation that is driving migration in the first place. Just look at the statistics. More than 86% of refugees live in the developing world, and the vast majority of them live in the first country they reach. Almost all of the refugees in Turkey, which has the world’s largest refugee population, have crossed the border from neighbouring Syria or Iraq. Lebanon hosts more refugees per capita and per square kilometre than any other; its 1.2 million Syrian refugees also came from next door. The Somalis at the world’s largest refugee camp in Kenya came from the next country along. The three million Afghans in Pakistan crossed just one border too. So the problem is not that too few refugees are staying in neighbouring countries. It’s that too many are forced to do so. Since the west has refused to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees from the Middle East, or from Pakistan or east Africa, those refugees have been forced to choose between a life of limbo – in places where they do not have access to education, healthcare or work rights – or irregular migration to the west. And in 2015, a significant minority chose the latter, leading to what we have termed the European refugee crisis. If May wants a new and effective policy, then organised resettlement – and the provision of safe and legal routes – is one option available to her. Instead, Britain was at the heart of behind-the-scenes moves to take out a pledge to resettle 10% of the world’s refugees from a new treaty signed on Monday at the UN summit in New York. What about the increased border protection May speaks of? It’s certainly not new. This has been the knee-jerk migration policy of choice in Europe over the past 15 years. It’s not very effective, with walls simply shifting migrants elsewhere, and often forces them into the hands of smugglers. Increased policing of the Canary islands’ maritime borders, and ever-higher fences between Morocco and Spain, proved meaningless once migration routes shifted through Libya. Greece and Bulgaria’s two fences along their respective Turkish borders saw migrants take new routes to the Greek islands. Hungary’s Serbian fence routed people west through Croatia. And while Macedonia’s fence along its Greek border has significantly reduced Balkan migration numbers this year, at least 25,000 people have still passed through the Balkans since the Macedonian fenceborder was sealed in March. What’s next on May’s shopping list? Differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. Taken at face value, this suggestion is at best misguided. One of the lessons I’ve learnt from reporting on migration in more than 20 countries is that the line between who’s fleeing poverty and who’s fleeing war is rarely clear-cut. How do you classify someone who left Senegal to find work in Libya, but then fled Libya to escape a war? What about a Syrian who reached Turkey from bombed-out Aleppo, and then left Turkey because he wasn’t allowed to work? May isn’t interested in such nuances. She isn’t after better definitions – she simply wants to change them so that fewer vulnerable people qualify for legal protection in Britain. Again, this isn’t new. Last year, the Home Office, which she ran, adopted highly controversial guidelines that made it far harder for Eritreans to qualify for asylum in Britain. This change in classification didn’t make things better – a few months later a UN committee accused the Eritrean government of committing widespread crimes against humanity against its own people. But it did reduce the number of people able to seek sanctuary in the UK. Finally, there’s the implicit suggestion that investment in developing countries should be pursued at the expense of resettlement programmes. Development is indeed essential in the general sense, and in the long term it may reduce migration. But migration researchers have shown it is no silver bullet. As specialists such as Hein de Haas have explained: “Emigration initially goes up with levels of development, and only goes down once countries move into high development categories. It indicates that if poor countries become wealthier, emigration will increase.” The world certainly needs new and more effective means of addressing protracted refugee crises. But the ideas set out by Theresa May don’t fall in either category."
2016-12-09T12:22:07Z,The charities supported by the Guardian and Observer 2016 appeal,"The Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2016 is supporting three charities working to help child refugees and migrants, both in Europe and the UK: Help Refugees, Safe Passage and the Children’s Society. Here is a guide to what they do, and why they do it. Help Refugees Help Refugees was founded 16 months ago by a group of friends who were moved by the refugee crisis in Calais and wanted to help. Their original plan was to raise £1,000 to buy food and clothes. In a week they had collected £56,000 and tonnes of donated goods. Within a month, with the help of local partners, Help Refugees had become the largest supplier of aid to unofficial camps in northern France, and after a year it had raised £3m. It is now one of Europe’s largest distributors of emergency aid to refugees, supporting more than 50 projects in Greece, Turkey, France and Syria. Projects funded by Help Refugees have been feeding 20,000 people a day. Its volunteer-led programme built 1,500 shelters in the Calais camp. It has funded a mobile medical clinic in Greece and ambulances in Syria, and flown volunteer doctors to Lesbos. Mountains of shoes, tents, coats and sleeping bags have been distributed – needed more than ever now as winter bites. It has paid for makeshift schools, community centres, and safe spaces for women. As the Observer reported this year: “There are people living now thanks to [Help Refugees] who would otherwise be dead.” Co-founder Josie Naughton says: “Over the last year we have been working tirelessly to fill the terrifying gaps in the provision of services left by governments and large NGOs. Our remit is expanding almost on a daily basis, funding everything from baby milk distribution to search and rescue. However we never lose sight of the long-term solutions needed for fairer treatment for displaced people. ” Help Refugees works in partnership with an array of organisations, from Doctors of the World to grassroots operations such as l’Auberge des Migrants, Lighthouse Relief and the Refugee Youth Service. These alliances, says the charity, allow it to be both effective and agile, ensuring aid gets to where it is needed quickly without compromising the quality of service. It can respond to real-time needs, unencumbered by convention or bureaucracy. Help Refugees runs its programmes as a charitable fund under the auspices of another charity, Prism the Gift Fund, which provides administration, finance and governance services. This partnership, it says, has helped it focus on helping refugees while keeping overheads incredibly low. But it is the donors and volunteers who power Help Refugees. Naughton says: “Everything we do is only possible thanks to the compassion and humanity of the thousands of people who like us couldn’t stand by and do nothing in the face of the biggest humanitarian crisis since world war two.” The Children’s Society The UK may represent a haven for many child refugees after the hardships of their flight from home, especially for those who arrive unaccompanied by their families. But for those struggling with a new language and culture, adjusting to their new life is often lonely and stressful. Everyday existence can be confusing and frightening. The youngsters may have no friends or possessions; it can be hard to get access to education or suitable housing; they must navigate complicated asylum legal processes and intimidating bureaucracies while coping with traumatic memories of violence, war and separation from family. Too often, there is no one to help guide them as they try to rebuild their lives. The Children’s Society runs a network of nine programmes across England that support young refugees, asylum seekers and migrants. They provide a range of services, including legal advice and housing support, advocacy, mentoring and befriending, help with language skills, therapeutic support, social and creative activities, and life skills, from money management to relationships counselling. “Young people fleeing war, violence and persecution need both immediate protection and long-term help to recover from the unimaginable trauma they have been through. Sadly, we know that many young refugees arriving in the UK instead find themselves facing further uncertainty, isolation and challenges that can seem insurmountable,” explains Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children’s Society. “Our specialist staff and volunteers are there to support them to overcome those challenges, make new friends and start to flourish in their new lives.” Last year the society’s programmes in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, London, Birmingham and Coventry worked with 674 children and young people. This is intensive, one-to-one work, with specialist staff spending six to eight weeks with a young person who may be facing multiple challenges. It ran 777 group work sessions on issues related to seeking asylum, including discrimination, housing and benefits. Reed says: “Our projects are making a real difference for young refugees every day, but as increasing numbers of vulnerable young people seek safety in this country, our project workers aren’t able to help all those who desperately need them. “The money raised by Guardian readers will be absolutely crucial, helping us reach more young refugees and migrants, giving them the support and the warm welcome they need to make sure they get the best possible start to their life in the UK.” Safe Passage “I can’t describe how I felt when I first saw my brother again, after two years. At that moment I felt hugely thankful to Safe Passage and everyone who had helped me.” Adnan was just 14 when, after a perilous journey from Syria followed by a traumatic five months in the squalor of the migrant camp in Calais, he was reunited with his brother – his only surviving relative – in the UK. Adnan is now happily living with his brother and attending school in Manchester, where he is learning to speak English. For Safe Passage, Adnan’s story marks another “proud moment”, giving a child fleeing war sanctuary from harm and an opportunity to rebuild his or her life. Safe Passage was set up in 2015 by the social action charity Citizens UK to help unaccompanied child refugees find safe and legal routes to sanctuary. “We believe every person, and particularly every child, fleeing persecution should be able to access a safe and legal route to a place they can live a full and dignified life,” says Citizens UK’s leader, Rabbi Janet Darley. Safe Passage used a range of strategies to open new routes to safety for children, from community organising to working with parliamentarians from all major parties, such as Lord Dubs, and the MPs Yvette Cooper and Heidi Allen to amend the Immigration Act, placing legal obligations on the UK to help unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. To date Safe Passage has reunited more than 70 child refugees and vulnerable adults with their loved ones in the UK. Its work has also helped a further 500 vulnerable unaccompanied refugee children come to Britain after the demolition of the Calais camp. Many have UK family, but dozens were brought under the terms of the Dubs amendment, which allows very vulnerable children without family in the UK to legally find safety and care here. Today Safe Passage works with partners, including the UNHCR and a number of smaller charities, to identify unaccompanied refugee children in Greece, Italy, northern France and beyond – often on the streets, in police cells, hostels or refugee camps. Once identified, Safe Passage lays the legal groundwork to help them reach safety. In October, Safe Passage, along with another of the Guardian and Observer appeal charities, Help Refugees, received a Liberty Human Rights award given in memory of the late MP Jo Cox, citing their “remarkable efforts” in safeguarding refugee children. Neil Jameson, executive director of Citizens UK, says: “Guardian and Observer readers’ donations will help identify and protect unaccompanied refugee children in Europe who have a legal right to be safeguarded in the UK. “We will fight legal cases for refugee children, and organise communities to challenge governments to set up a working system. Donations will also be used to enable our network of member organisations to provide vital support to children and families on their arrival in the UK.” Support our three chosen charities by donating here."
2016-10-23T05:00:36Z,Why is it vulgar to speak up for migrants?,"In London an exhibition has just opened at the Barbican called The Vulgar. It is a fashion exhibition, with clothes that are often funny, but spotlit on mannequins so nobody laughs. There’s a Hussein Chalayan dress covered in false nails, a Courrèges minidress and 18th-century gowns the width of a studio flat. There are gold things. There are fans, which became vulgar when they were mass-produced. There are neo-classical dresses, vulgar because they are copies. Accompanying the fashions are definitions of the word by psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, which inspire the titles of each room: “Showing Off,” “Puritan,” “Extreme Bodies,” “Too Popular,” and “Common”. I sat with a cup of tea afterwards with one eye on Twitter. Lily Allen had been to the Jungle camp in Calais with the BBC and met a 13-year-old boy from Afghanistan. She broke down as she explained to him: “At three different intervals… the English in particular have put you in danger… We’ve bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I’m sorry for what we have put you through.” On Twitter she was dismissed as “pampered, coiffured and irrelevant”, urged to “speak for herself, not the nation – she represents nobody”, and received multiple warnings of rape, both for her and her daughters. The Sun said hers were “crocodile tears”, writing: “Before Lily starts ‘apologising’ for Brit troops taking on the Taliban, perhaps she should say sorry for her own mistakes. Two years ago her appalling single ‘URL Badman’ tanked at No 93. Earlier this year the attention-seeking mum passed out after a bender at the Notting Hill Carnival.” Jan Moir dedicated her Daily Mail column to Allen: “Just another indulged idiot who fondly imagines herself to be a daring and provocative political voice… Darling Lily got a fabulous manicure, put on an ever-so-serious, no-make-up face and took a camera crew with her to visit the Jungle. (There ain’t much in the way of practical work a gal can do with those nails, but never mind.) It looked quite good when Lily was filmed ladling out the soup for five minutes,” she said, adding: “The 31-year-old mother of two started crying, which must have been very confusing for the little boy, not to mention scary – but at least she didn’t sing.” As I read the criticism, one of Phillips’s definitions flashed to mind. Vulgar: “Impossible ambition: the arrivistes, the nouveau riche, the immigrants, the upwardly mobile.” People trying to be something they are not. People, like Allen, who should know their place. People trespassing on politics, on grown-up issues. She’s not even a good mother so why should we take her seriously? She doesn’t even have the right NAILS. How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for. Once the concept of vulgarity is in your head it’s hard to shake it out – you recognise it in debates about Brexit, anti-semitism, homophobia. You start questioning why people like Jan Moir and the furious Tweeters find Allen’s visit to Calais so threatening. Like a pensioner wearing a Topshop catsuit, Allen is parading her inappropriate views and emotions in full view of a crowd. She is getting above her station and needs to be knocked back. It’s not simply about her celebrity – I can’t remember a single furious column when Jude Law visited Calais, or Benedict Cumberbatch spoke of the “utter disgrace of the British government” for not doing enough. But their visits weren’t “vulgar” – there is nothing that disorients us about well-educated men speaking passionately. That’s how the world is meant to sound, regardless of what they’re saying. In the shadow of the exhibition, the whole episode made me feel sorry for those rising up to chastise Allen. If her tears and nails and apology require such scorn, doesn’t it suggest a degree of desperation and fear in the scornful? After spending time with those clothes, those images, the 19th-century etiquette manuals and Elizabethan document “enforcing the status of apparel” on materials that were restricted according to class, I sense an ancient anxiety that the barriers these judgers rely on for structure might be disappearing. The risk being then, that their houses would simply crumble. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"
2016-06-20T10:18:28Z,"The refugee crisis is a problem of poverty, not just migration | Sarah Dalrymple","Images of Syrians fleeing their homes and taking treacherous journeys in search of safety in Europe have dominated the news as levels of global displacement have escalated. Figures released on Monday by the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, show that forced displacement affected more than 65 million people in 2015, the highest level ever recorded. Most of these people are in developing countries in their regions of origin.With two landmark meetings in the offing, the world is facing tough decisions on how it responds to the crisis. In September, a gathering convened by the UN secretary general and a summit hosted by the US president, Barack Obama, will offer a chance to tackle the situation and strengthen global responsibility-sharing. But how much do we really know about those affected and the resources available? Do we have enough information to develop an effective and forward-thinking response? Estimates of the numbers of forced migrants – including refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people – are publicly available. In addition to annual estimates by UNHCR on the number of people who have been forcibly displaced, Eurostat provides data on first-time asylum seekers registered in the EU, which are believed to have reached a record high of more than 1.2 million people last year (pdf). The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre collates data on the number of internally displaced people worldwide, which is estimated to have reached 40.8 million at the end of 2015, an increase of 2.8 million in a year. However, the question of who gets counted is a politically charged issue. Difficulties in accessing populations within host communities and outside camps – or in counting non-registered refugees, people who have been repeatedly forced from their homes, and those who have been displaced for a long time – mean that some people are invisible, and ultimately do not get help. The crux of the issue is that collecting data on refugees has traditionally been the domain of humanitarian organisations, on the one hand, as they sought to address immediate needs, and national asylum and immigration systems, on the other hand, as they tracked and processed claims. This means that refugees are often omitted from national poverty surveys and other crucial studies, and so are left out of efforts to track the progress of people moving out of poverty. The longer-term livelihood needs of refugees and displaced people are not systematically addressed (pdf). Given the burgeoning scale and protracted nature of the crisis, there is a pressing need for data on refugees and migrants to be a poverty and development issue – not just a humanitarian or migration concern. The complexity of refugees’ needs demands a more sophisticated understanding of poverty and a repertoire of political, humanitarian and socio-economic responses, as well as evidence on the actual and potential economic contribution of refugees in their host countries. As a step in the right direction, the World Bank and UNHCR undertook the first poverty and welfare assessment of a refugee population, in Jordan and Lebanon in December, drawing lessons for forced migrants elsewhere. New financing tools are emerging, bringing together multilateral banks, Islamic financing and aid donors. But when looking at funding, and resources beyond humanitarian assistance, the availability and quality of data is also a challenge. We do not have a full picture of what countries are spending on hosting refugees, or of donors’ responses to displacement elsewhere. The only international platform for host countries to report spending does not give us all the facts. It only shows what can be counted as official development assistance and, within this, reporting practices vary dramatically (pdf). It doesn’t show the contributions of many developing countries, such as Lebanon and Pakistan, that host large numbers of refugees. In addition, the data is out of date, since it is published a year after it is spent. In the absence of comparable and up-to-date data, not only do myths creep into the rhetoric, but it’s also hard to identify and fill financing gaps. How can we improve the data on refugees to ensure that they aren’t left behind? Collect poverty data on refugees and migrants, and place this at the centre of decision-making. The inclusion of refugees and displaced people in national poverty surveys would, for example, ensure that their needs are reflected in national planning. Strengthen the timeliness of expenditure information by reporting to the international aid transparency initiative. This would enable all development and humanitarian resources, including refugee-hosting costs, to be tracked side-by-side in a timely manner. Data on refugees and financing still won’t tell us the full story. But understanding the poverty of people forced to flee, and the investments needed to help them, would constitute a vital step in the right direction. Sarah Dalrymple is a senior policy and engagement adviser on humanitarian and conflict issues at Development Initiatives, which will publish a report on trends in humanitarian financing on 27 June"
2016-11-23T10:21:27Z,Seven 'migrants' rescued in boat in Folkestone harbour,"Seven people, thought to be migrants, were rescued in a boat in Folkestone harbour in the early hours of Wednesday morning after at least three began suffering from hypothermia. The small boat they were sailing in was found in the harbour after a distress call was made while it was out at sea. It is believed the boat reached the shore without assistance. Kent police said they were called to the scene just after 5.30am because of concerns about the boat. They said: “The Coastguard coordinated a search for the boat which was located at Folkestone harbour and seven suspected migrants were also found.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a search-and-rescue operation had been launched after a call was received from a boat reporting that people on board were unwell. A spokesman said: “A boat with seven people on board, including three with suspected hypothermia, was then found.” The recovered boat was a small red and black rib (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) with an outboard motor, according to the BBC reporter Simon Jones. The South East Coast ambulance service was also called. “The matter has been passed to Home Office immigration enforcement,” the statement from Kent police added. The Home Office has yet to comment. Speaking to Kent Online, a spokesman for the Kent coastguard said: “There are seven people, possibly immigrants, all males. One was on shore, the others were in a boat. We are now trying to find out where they originated from.” Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, said the incident highlighted the need to protect UK borders following the closure of the Calais refugee camp. He said: “This is yet another sign of the extreme lengths people will go to, risking their lives trying to break into Britain. Crossing the English Channel in a small boat as winter sets in is about as dangerous as it gets. “It’s clear that although the camp at Calais has been cleared, we now need to be more vigilant than ever. This incident underlines the need to ensure we scan our seas for people smugglers, protect our borders and to strengthen our intelligence effort with France.”"
2016-09-18T23:01:30Z,Theresa May to warn  UN of dangers of uncontrolled mass migration,"Theresa May is to tell the UN general assembly of the dangers of “uncontrolled mass migration” as it meets in New York to discuss how to help more than 21 million refugees around the world. The prime minister will call for a different global approach to migration aimed at “reducing today’s unmanaged population movement” as world leaders gather for the general assembly and a separate summit hosted by Barack Obama. At the UN, May will argue that it is not in the interests of the migrants to be exposed to exploitation and danger as they cross borders, nor the interests of the countries they are leaving, travelling through or seeking to reach. She will say that mass population movements reduce resources and popular support for refugees. Her arguments appear to echo those made by David Cameron’s government, which targeted most of its aid to refugees in countries bordering war zones, in contrast to Germany’s approach of accepting hundreds of thousands of people who had journeyed across Europe. It does, however, leave the door open for the UK to accept more refugees straight from camps, who have not embarked on journeys across seas and borders. May will propose three measures: helping refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants; and the right of all countries to control their borders, along with a responsibility to stop uncontrolled migration flows. Speaking before the general assembly, May said: “We cannot simply focus on treating the symptoms of this crisis, we need to address its root causes too.” The gathering comes as May faces criticism in the UK for failing to do enough to help refugees and demands to improve the UK’s pledge to settle 20,000 people from Syria over four years. Last week, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of 200 religious leaders to call for more action, criticising the government’s response as “too slow, too low and too narrow”. David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK will resettle more refugees. “Frankly, the UK should be saying we’ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year, so four times the current level, 25 refugees per parliamentary constituency rather than just six, because countries like Canada are already doing that,” he said. “So I think the UK could do more on the refugee resettlement side to match the frankly exemplary performance that the UK has on international humanitarian aid.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, called on May to speed up the government’s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians – setting a 2018 target rather than 2020 – and offer more help to those fleeing the war. She urged the prime minister to resettle 500 unaccompanied child refugees from the Calais camp and ensure that none were left by Christmas. “The prime minister must show leadership on the refugee crisis,” Cooper said. “She must go to this summit to galvanise international support for refugees and show that Britain can and will meet our commitments. Right now, the decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging.” The UN summit on refugees and migrants comes as the outgoing secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Obama attempt to use their remaining time in office to try to make some headway on issue. The UK government has said it will support the New York declaration on refugees and migrants due to be adopted at the UN, which reaffirms humanitarian principles but has been criticised by campaign groups for lacking teeth. Human Rights Watch called the draft of the final document “a missed opportunity” and Amnesty International accused member states of stripping away any proposals of substance. On Tuesday, Obama will host a separate leaders’ summit which will attempt to raise money and secure concrete pledges from countries to accept higher numbers of refugees for resettlement. May is expected to announce additional humanitarian support for refugees from the government’s ring-fenced aid budget later this week, and further action to provide services and create jobs in host countries."
2016-02-06T17:29:18Z,"To help real refugees, be firm with economic migrants | Nick Cohen","When the migrant crisis first pierced the British imagination, there was barely a Syrian in sight. On 30 July 2015, when the prime minister warned that a “swarm of people” were heading for Britain, I could not find one refugee from Assad in the shanty town in the fields north of Calais. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but going back through my notes I see I met Eritreans, Nigerians, Ethiopians and Sudanese. French volunteers told me there were Syrians somewhere in “the jungle”, along with Afghans and Pakistanis. But they did not make up the majority or even a large minority of the men and women planning to stow away on the Eurostar or jump on a passing lorry. The great wave of migrants moving towards Europe has never been composed solely of Syrians. An arc of instability surrounds our continent. In Nigeria, Boko Haram still operates and the collapse in the oil price has wrecked the economy. In Chad and Niger, global warming has turned farmland to desert. Warlords and their barbaric militias have pushed civilians to the edge of starvation in Sudan. Eritrea remains a police state from which the young want to flee. Libya remains a failed state, where the same impulse applies. The Middle East is locked in a sectarian war between Sunni and Shia, which feels as if it will be as long and monstrous as Europe’s Thirty Years’ War between Catholics and Protestants. And the Russians are once again menacing Ukraine. It says much about the parochialism and self-indulgence of the British right that they are threatening to add to the chaos by yanking Britain out of the EU at a moment of continental crisis. But it also tells you that hundreds of thousands would still try to get to Europe, even if the Syrian conflict were solved tomorrow. There was something else I didn’t notice at the time, which strikes me now. The Calais migrant camp was so small. There were about 3,000 people there and you could cross it in 20 minutes. Compare the few thousand trying to reach Britain from Calais with the 1.2 million who flooded into Europe last year entranced by the apparently welcoming governments of Germany and Sweden. Actually, forget that; compare them with the numbers coming now. Last week, the International Organisation for Migration reported that 67,000 arrived in Europe by boat last month. This in winter when the weather is meant to deter people from taking to sea. Their numbers will grow. Assad’s forces, with Russian and Iranian backing, are now threatening Aleppo, and sending tens of thousands fleeing north. The abysmal failure of the west to develop a coherent Syrian strategy has now boomeranged and smashed us in the face. Putin must look with satisfaction while his client’s armies drive refugees into the European Union and threaten to destroy its founding principle of freedom of movement. He must look with even greater pleasure on the far-left clique that has taken over the British Labour party and is so enamoured of Russian imperialism it cannot bring itself to utter one squeak of protest, not even for form’s sake. Above all, he must enjoy the spreading fear. The Cologne attacks brought fear of sexual molestation. The politically insane and unintentionally racist decision by the German and Swedish authorities to cover up crimes by individual migrants branded all migrants as sexual predators and brought fear of the authorities’ intentions. The Paris attacks brought the fear of terrorism extending across the continent. And the sheer weight of numbers brought the fear of cultures being overwhelmed. All of them are encouraging the rise of far-right parties, which, by a happy coincidence for a Kremlin whose bombers are driving refugees into Europe, are as wiling as the leaders of the British Labour party to bend the knee to Putin. Across Europe, governments are clamping down. Germany has quietly set a limit on North Africans claiming asylum. I am told by sources I trust that Britain has with even greater secrecy decided that it will not take Palestinian refugees living in Syria. (As the Assad regime never gave them passports, they are stateless people; Britain could never send them home in the unlikely event of peace returning to Syria.) If liberals want to defend refugees in these dark times, they are going to have to ditch prejudices that have become a self-defeating menace. The first is the waffle you hear everywhere that there’s no difference between refugees and economic migrants. In theory, there’s truth in the argument that a man who is about to starve to death is in no better or worse predicament than a woman who knows Assad’s forces or Islamic State will execute her. In practice, a starving man has neither the strength nor the money to flee, while some victims of political persecution can escape, if they can find a country to take them. By blurring the distinction between genuine refugees and economic migrants, liberals let their governments off the hook. For a generation, home secretaries have said that Britain is a lovely, tolerant country. We welcome genuine refugees, of course we do. It is only economic migrants we want to stop. Their combined statements comprise one enormous lie. Britain has accepted economic migrants by the millions. As for asylum seekers, in 2014, they made up a mere 8% of the total number of immigrants. Liberals also need to stop treating their fellow citizens as if they were closet Nazis. It is no good screaming that they are “racists”, like some no-platforming student dogmatist. Some may be. Others will have real concerns that lying applicants and sharp lawyers can rig the system. They will only welcome genuine refugees if bogus asylum seekers are speedily removed. The president of Finland was too close for comfort when he said last week that “anyone who knows how to pronounce the word ‘asylum’ can enter Europe” and disappear before their case is judged. If you look at all the different nationalities who make it to Calais you can see that the migration crisis will continue, whatever happens in Syria. The longer it continues, the more acute the liberal dilemma will become. If you want to be a true liberal and persuade your society to accept genuine refugees, you must accept authoritarian measures and agree to the rapid expulsion of illegal immigrants."
2016-09-19T11:54:15Z,Theresa May's quasi-Darwinian fight to dilute right to claim asylum,"Theresa May will use her first speech to the United Nations to argue that the world’s wealthiest countries should offer only minimum protection to all but the most vulnerable of the world’s refugees. It will mark the start of her international campaign to dilute the right to claim asylum and to ensure – by enshrining the principle that claims for asylum should be made in the first safe country – that more than 86% of the world’s refugees are looked after by the poorest and middle-income countries. For make no mistake, when May talks of agreeing “a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants” she is talking about limiting the right of asylum seekers to reach Europe to have their claims for refugee status properly considered. When she also proposes that countries must “take responsibility to stop uncontrolled migrant flows” she is willing the means to ensure that happens. We know this because the UN’s speech is not a one-off. Indeed May showcased her strategy for dealing with the worst refugee crisis since the second world war in her Conservative party conference speech as home secretary last October. Then she made clear that she wanted to limit the number of asylum seekers who made it to Britain to claim refugee status by branding those who had made it across the Mediterranean to Calais or Britain as the “wealthiest, fittest and strongest” with the quasi-Darwinian implication that they are in some way undeserving queue-jumpers. She said more than 290,000 Syrians had claimed asylum across Europe at that point, and contrasted them sharply with the plight of the “most vulnerable” refugees in the Middle East camps. May boasted of Britain’s decision to take 20,000 of those most vulnerable refugees and promised she would “not in a thousand years” take part in any Europe-wide refugee responsibility-sharing programme. Instead May asserted last October that she wanted Britain to unilaterally enforce the “first safe country” rule by breaking the link between being recognised as a refugee and getting the right to settle in Britain. “If you’ve spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere – but we cannot return you to that safe country and you still need refuge – you’ll get the minimum stay of protection and you won’t have an automatic right to settle here,” she warned, adding that when that came to an end they would be returned as soon as a case review deemed it safe for them to do so. This lesser form of refugee status will also apply to those who successfully claim asylum after overstaying a British visa. She also launched her campaign for a review of the international legal definitions of who can qualify as a refugee or be rejected as an economic migrant to chip away at the 1951 Geneva convention definitions of those who should not be returned to countries where they face serious threats to their lives or freedom. This was not just party conference rhetoric. Home Office ministers confirmed in February that work was under way on a strategy to cut the numbers claiming asylum in Britain and to provide temporary protection to all but the “most deserving” refugees. There is a new twist. In her final months as home secretary, May was considering introducing a policy that a greater number of the most vulnerable refugees would be resettled in Britain only if it matched a reduction in those claiming asylum after reaching Britain under their own steam. Today’s UN summit on refugees and migrants will see many developing countries arguing for a major expansion in legal routes such as resettlement programmes, so that the wealthiest countries share some of the responsibility for the greatest refugee crisis since the second world war. They are hoping the UN special assembly will prove a watershed moment in the world’s response. Instead of rising to the challenge, the British prime minister will be blocking people’s escape routes and leaving the world’s poorest countries to cope with the crisis."
2016-12-20T18:00:07Z,The child refugees of Calais: ‘The journey is not yet over’,"Of all the children stuck in the Calais camp, 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) was one of the best able to articulate the horror of his situation, living in a tent for months, with no adult to care for him. I met him in August and was impressed by his elegant English, which he had learned from his father, a Nato translator who was targeted by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who had been forced to flee the country separately. Jawaad had no idea where his father was, and had travelled from Afghanistan to France alone. He was finding the conditions in Calais hard to bear. “Every second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police are familiar with beating. They don’t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog’s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails,” he told me, in the tarpaulin shack known as the Kids’ Cafe. When the camp in Calais was demolished, he was one of 1,700 young people put on buses to youth hostels and former old people’s homes and given temporary accommodation while their applications for asylum in the UK were processed. When we spoke by phone in mid-November, he was in a hostel in Talence, Bordeaux. He said he was relieved to be somewhere warm, where he could have a shower, but he hated the feeling of being in limbo. He said the interviewing process by Home Office officials who were assessing his application to join his cousins and uncle in Southampton was “disorganised”. He complained that because none of the boys spoke French and the staff did not speak English, they were communicating through Google Translate on phones. “People feel unhappy and angry,” he said. We know that he travelled to the UK at the end of November, one of 750 unaccompanied refugee children. He is in care while officials consider his application, but beyond that there are very few details of his current existence. He is no longer in touch with Mary Jones, who helped run the Kids’ Cafe. Once the children are taken into care in the UK, they often fall out of contact; usually they are encouraged by their foster parents to cut ties, to avoid any risk that they could be targeted by people smugglers, who may be anxious to have travel debts repaid. Jawaad “is one of the lucky ones”, says Jones, “if you can call a child lucky when he has no idea where his parents are, just that his father is in hiding from the Taliban and his mother had to flee their village when it was overrun by fighters from Daesh”. At least we know now that he is safe, able to study and work towards his ambition of becoming a doctor. Volunteers who worked with the Calais refugee children are more worried about those who remain in France, waiting for a decision on their future. Some have gone on hunger strike. The Home Office announced earlier this month that it has ended the emergency transfer programme to the UK, which means that up to a thousand more Calais children are still waiting. Jones is very worried about reports that several children have left the hostels and are sleeping rough again. “The journey is not yet over for [Jawaad], but hopefully it will just be a matter of weeks before he can get on with his life. For his friends and other refugee children left in France, most of them have given up hope and several have attempted suicide. It is only a matter of time before they go back to Calais and put their faith in smugglers again.” Donate to our refugee appeal at guardian.charitiestrust.org"
2016-12-23T12:23:25Z,The charity rebuilding the lives of refugee children in Britain,"It would be comforting to be able to say of Ahsanullah Ahsas, a young man from Afghanistan who loves volleyball, clothes and the warmth of friendship, that he is now a regular teenager again, after fleeing his country’s horrors when his father was killed by the Taliban. But the world has been catastrophically cruel to him and recovery is not so simple – his struggles and worries continue even in this country, even in Leeds, to where the Home Office “dispersed” him from Dover when he arrived here at the end of his terrible journey. As he relates some of his traumas, Ahsanullah is hunched, quiet, at times heartbreakingly raw. He had to run from home because, as the eldest of three sons, he had received death threats; his mother paid an “agent” in Kabul to transport him to England, where she believed he could be safe. On the suffocatingly hot car journey across Iran, he and three others were crammed underneath the back seats, and could barely breathe. He was arrested, imprisoned and beaten by police in Europe; he tramped miles through woods in the rain; finally he remembers cold terror in the back of a lorry from Calais, before he jumped out and found himself in Kent, alone, with no possessions. He believes it was Dover, and he turned himself in at a police station. Several times, he recounts with awed wonder how decent the English police officers were; that rather than beat him, one reached out and affectionately ruffled his hair. “I didn’t expect that from a police officer, to rub my head, like a friendly person,” Ahsanullah says. “In other countries I had been beaten, put in prison, punished, for no crime. But here, the police were very nice.” There are moments when he does break into a smile, and looks like a young lad who knows what happiness is. He smiles when he remembers school, friends, the good teachers and playing volleyball back home in Afghanistan before the terror – and here in Leeds, when he talks of what the Children’s Society has done for him to turn his life around. One of the Guardian and Observer’s three appeal charities that provide help to child refugees, the Children’s Society gives concentrated, practical support to vulnerable, severely traumatised young people who arrive in Britain unaccompanied. Din Nazim, the Children’s Society advocacy worker, himself a refugee from Afghanistan who marshals a remarkable range of professional skills and languages, is part of a small team in Leeds, which last year provided one-to-one help to 62 young people, and reached almost 700 more at drop-in centres and other services. Mostly they are, like Ahsanullah, boys alone, who have fled conflicts or civil turmoil in Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea, Sudan and elsewhere. Nazim first found Ahsanullah in Urban House in Wakefield, an “initial accommodation centre” to which asylum seekers are sent before being dispersed across Yorkshire. Ahsanullah says he was 16 when he fled his home last summer, but he has been officially assessed here as 18, and so an adult needing no young person’s support. He was allocated a house shared with other adults, and an asylum seeker’s £36 per week welfare, which paid for bare subsistence. When Nazim went to see him at the house, he found Ahsanullah in a dreadful state. “He was just sitting with his head down; he wasn’t doing anything. He was just crying, all the time,” Nazim remembers. “He was very, very upset.” Nazim went to work. He saw Ahsanullah every day to help address his trauma and start rebuilding his confidence. Nazim secured a referral from the Refugee Council for a solicitor to help with Ahsanullah’s asylum claim and age assessment challenge, and helped him enroll at college to learn English. The teenager is now at Leeds city college three days a week, where he works at his English and has made friends with other young people. He attends a youth group, First Floor, an orientation and harm prevention programme which is fun too, run with the West Yorkshire Playhouse theatre, and – here Ahsanullah smiles brightly – he has made friends there as well. An important part of the Children’s Society’s work is partnering refugees with young volunteers who act as mentors; Ahsanullah talks of his as if he was a guardian angel: Isidoros Lapsatis, from Greece, who was a student at Leeds Beckett university. “He was very nice,” Ahsanullah says. “He came to my house, took me round Leeds, he showed me where to buy cheap food and clothes, showed me the pound shops, took me to the museum, showed me the stadium – he showed me everything.” Ahsanullah volunteered to talk about his experiences, and the help he has had, because Nazim’s and the Children’s Society’s support has transformed his existence here. But then, asked if he would like to add anything, he returns immediately to the lurking horror at the forefront of his mind. He cannot turn the lights out at night and sleep, he says, because he has flashbacks to seeing his father killed. Nazim looks downcast. Funding of mental health services for refugees has been slashed, he says. The Children’s Society says £50,000 a year could fund a full-time counsellor. The charity appeal money will pay for more project workers like Nazim and a drop-in service staffed by volunteers. They hope to start a new service in Kent, with one-to-one support and a local volunteer service, to help young people’s orientation in their first days after arrival. “I was so lucky to meet Din,” Ahsanullah says, “so lucky to be in the youth group. I am learning English and want to speak it very well. I am very, very worried about my asylum claim and where I could be sent if it fails, and Din has helped with that too. The Children’s Society has turned around my life. I want that to happen for all young people who come to this country.” • Support the Guardian and Observer charity appeal by donating here"
2016-07-28T00:00:20Z,"US and Mexico's mass deportations have fueled humanitarian crisis, report says","Mass deportations and inadequate asylum procedures in Mexico and the US have fueled a humanitarian crisis where desperate Central Americans seeking refuge from rampant violence are routinely preyed upon by criminal gangs and corrupt officials, according to a new report by the International Crisis Group (ICG). The tide of people fleeing Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala – three of the five most dangerous countries in the world – continues apace despite beefed-up border control measures implemented after Barack Obama declared the 2014 surge in undocumented migrants a humanitarian crisis. Last year, Mexico deported 165,000 Central Americans, while the US expelled 75,000. In order to avoid detection, vulnerable people – who include increasing numbers of women and unaccompanied children – are forced to pay higher fees to smugglers, crooked officials, and kidnappers, and use riskier, more isolated routes through Mexico, according to the report Easy Prey: Criminal Violence and Central American Migration. Once deported, many simply try again rather than face hunger and violence at home, creating a revolving door of vulnerable migrants and refugees. The report comes after the US, for the first time, recognised that the surge in people currently fleeing Central America includes potential refugees, not just economic migrants. The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a new scheme whereby Costa Rica will offer temporary protection to 200 eligible Central American refugees at a time before they are settled in the US or another country. While the news was welcomed as a positive emblematic step by immigrant rights’ groups, there was widespread scepticism about its potential impact amid rapidly rising asylum claims. As violence in the Northern Triangle spiked in 2015, the number of asylum seekers from these countries rose to more than 110,000 – a fivefold increase from 2012. Most seek refuge in Mexico and the US. Mary Speck, project director for Mexico and Central America at ICG, said: “The [announcement] shows some recognition by the US of this refugee crisis, and it will help some people. But it does nothing to address the major issue of the huge numbers of vulnerable Central Americans already in Mexico and the US.” As many as 400,000 undocumented migrants cross from Central America into southern Mexico each year, according to the International Organization for Migration. The number detained in Mexico has tripled in the past four years amid growing pressure and economic support from the US to stem the flow. The detention of children and adolescents from the Northern Triangle soared from 4,000 in 2011 to 35,000 in 2015. But Mexico is increasingly a destination country, not just a transit route. Asylum applications are rising amid information campaigns led by the UN Refugee Agency: 1,470 people applied for asylum in Mexico in the first three months of 2016 – a larger number than in the whole of 2013. Despite a recent increase in approved asylum claims, drawn-out assessments and inadequate detention facilities mean many who would be eligible either don’t apply or abandon their cases. Mexico has robust laws but its 15 asylum experts are struggling to cope. Mexico has the capacity to absorb many more people, but needs international help, according to the ICG. “The US outsourced its migrant policy to Mexico, and must now work with Mexico to deal with the massive numbers of vulnerable Central Americas here; there is no substitute for this. The mass deportations since 2014 have done nothing to stem the flow of Central Americans. The humanitarian crisis continues, it’s just no longer on the US border,” said Speck. The ICG report also calls on the US to halt the deportation of undocumented Central American youths by offering Temporary Protected Status (TPS) – which would allow them to work legally – rather than risk sending them back to violent neighborhoods. TPS is most commonly offered in cases of armed conflict and natural disasters but “providing it to Northern Triangle nationals facing surging criminal violence would be a reasonable step to protect individuals, especially youths, vulnerable to attacks or [gang] recruitment”, the report states."
2016-12-12T16:27:43Z,How schools are helping refugee children to succeed,"When Hyeon arrived in England, aged 15, she felt like a stranger. She was alone and spoke no English. “I couldn’t understand what was going on,” she says. “I didn’t even know the basic stuff such as how to use a computer or phone.” Hyeon is now 18 and studying at Harris Westminster sixth form. She was one of the thousands of children arriving in Britain to seek asylum each year. In 2015, 3,000 children arrived unaccompanied, while a further 5,000 dependants – who are mostly children – also came to the UK. Clearly, teachers have an important role to play – many children will have missed out on at least some education, and their experiences in school or college will contribute to how well they settle into the UK. So how are schools supporting these children? Spires Academy in Oxford is well versed in schooling refugee and asylum seeker children – and is often approached by other schools for advice. In a secondary school of about 1,000 students, there are currently 28 refugee or asylum seeker children between the ages of 11 and 18 on the roll; 13 of these were unaccompanied. Spires assesses children on arrival to judge what support they might need, and those without any English language are put on a beginners’ programme. Melanie Tuck, head of EAL at the school, explains: “They get three lessons a day for six weeks. We have a real push on basic language skills, so that when they go into mainstream classes they’re at least on their feet.” The programme is run throughout the year and also caters for other migrant children. After the six weeks, children join the usual timetabled classes but continue to get additional support from teaching staff. All teachers receive in-house training on working with students who have limited English, and children who may be struggling are given extra lessons outside the classroom. For older children, there is a full-time EAL sixth-form course, which gives them a grounding in English alongside a small amount of maths, science and humanities before they go on to their GCSEs. “If they’re coming in at 15, 16 or 17 with no English at all, you’re just giving them a mountain to climb,” explains Tuck. “If they come in as young as 12 or 13 we can put them in mainstream education and support them there because they’ve got time.” But helping these young people to settle, integrate and learn is about more than just academic support. Some of their needs are similar to those of migrant children – language and cultural differences, unfamiliarity with UK systems – but they may also have mental health difficulties. “We find that insomnia is very common, which has an obvious effect on a child’s ability to concentrate in school or college and may well affect their attendance,” explains Katie Pedder, senior programmes officer at the Refugee Support Network. “If their asylum claim has not been resolved, that is likely to cause a deep anxiety which will also affect their performance at school.” The College of North West London has built partnerships with charities to provide additional mental health support to its refugee and asylum seeker children. Staff always get training, run by the Refugee Support Network, about issues affecting refugees and asylum seekers, as well as initiatives to improve integration. Laura Armstrong, head of ESOL at the college, explains: “We work very closely with three charities – the Refugee Support Network, Young Roots and Paiwand – which help us to put on activities and events to encourage students to mix with each other.” The college doesn’t receive funding for this, but the partnerships work because they are mutually beneficial. When Paiwand had funding to run a girls’ group, for instance, the college was able to provide the students. For Hyeon, support initially came from the safeguarding department and now through regular meetings with a welfare officer. It was in this way that the sixth form was able to identify that she needed help with tasks such as buying food and cooking with British ingredients. Thanks to the help she’s had settling in, Hyeon has made strong progress academically and is studying for A-levels in maths, biology and chemistry. She hopes to become a doctor. Educating the whole school population about refugees, to foster a welcoming and tolerant community, is also helpful, says Pedder. Some schools and colleges are going further, helping students to play an active role in supporting their classmates. At Hammersmith and West London College, pupils have formed a Student Action for Refugees group, and are in the process of setting up conversation and homework clubs to support refugee and asylum seekers at the college. Oxford Spires Academy, meanwhile, is using volunteers from its sixth form to welcome new starters and offer mentoring – spending time together at lunchtime, doing homework together, or helping with English. For teachers looking to improve understanding of refugees and asylum seekers in their school, some help can be found online. The Refugee Support Network has links to useful websites, and Pedder also recommends the Refugee Week website, which provides materials useful for assemblies and lessons. The Refugee Welcome Schools initiative is also a way that schools can educate pupils on the topic while also offering practical assistance to refugees and asylum seekers in the local area (see @Leics_refugees on Twitter for a group of schools active in this). NALDIC offers guidance on areas such as welcoming children to the school, peer support and supporting emotional needs. It’s also a good idea for teachers to familiarise themselves not just with the general issues surrounding refugees and asylum seekers but the complications that an individual may be experiencing. This can be made more difficult because of tensions between the education system’s focus on targets and attendance and the fact that asylum seekers often have a lot of appointments – such as court dates or with social workers. “Teachers need to know this may be an issue and be proactive in talking about it,” she says. “Otherwise it can be easy for the teacher to think the student is missing college because they’re lazy, or for the student to miss important appointments.” But this requires a careful approach – not just because of what some of these children have been through, but because ultimately they don’t necessarily want to be singled out as different. “One things we’ve noticed it that they just want to feel that they are normal students and progress,” says Armstrong. “And I think that’s really important, so although we do have all these services and support systems in place, they’re not picked out as a special group – and they can just get on with their lives.” Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.

2016-09-20T16:48:44Z,Work begins on Calais wall to stop refugees trying to board lorries to UK,"Work has begun on a £1.9m wall to block migrants and asylum seekers from attempting to board lorries heading to the Calais port. The structure will stand 4 metres tall and 1km long on both sides of the dual carriageway approaching the port, a few hundred metres from the main refugee camp, where more than 10,000 people live in conditions that charities describe as dangerous and dirty. It will be made of smooth concrete, making it harder to climb, and extends an existing wire fence that flanks the immediate approach to the port. But charities working with those in the camp have said the project will endanger lives by forcing migrants and refugees to take ever greater risks to reach the UK. Steve Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “This wall will simply push desperate people further into the hands of smugglers and into taking far greater risks to get to the UK, and more will die in the attempt.” The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, announced the plan last week. It will be paid for by the British government as part of a £17m joint Anglo-French package of security measures aimed at preventing people from the “Jungle” refugee camp from stowing away on lorries and other vehicles on the French side of the border. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has said he intends to dismantle the camp entirely by the end of the year. In 2015-16 more than 84,000 migrants and refugees were caught trying to illegally enter the UK at “juxtaposed ports” such as Calais – where immigration checks are carried out before boarding a train or ferry – according to Home Office figures. Photos of foundation works on the wall emerged on Tuesday, but a Home Office spokesman said construction started last week. Charities working with those in the camp say that 13 refugees and migrants, including three children, have died this year attempting to board vehicles approaching the port in a desperate attempt to reach Britain. Last week, a 14-year-old Afghan boy became the latest fatality, dying in a hit-and-run after he fell off a lorry. The boy, who has not been named, was understood to have a legal right to travel to the UK as he had relatives there, but had become frustrated with delays in processing his case. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting on to the road every night. They put tree trunks, branches, gas cylinders” in the road to stop the trucks, the Calais port chief executive, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, said earlier this month, according to AFP. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults,” he said. Research by Help Refugees, one of the charities that works in the camp, found that in September the camp’s population rose above 10,000 for the first time, including more than 1,000 unaccompanied children. An official count by the French authorities last month put the number of people in the camp at 6,900. Matilda Gladstone, a spokeswoman for Help Refugees, said: “We are disheartened that once again money and resources are being poured into building walls to keep people out, and not into helping care for the vulnerable, displaced people in the refugee camp in Calais.” She added: “We would like to see Theresa May prioritise the safety of children over the fear of immigration.” Leigh Daynes, the executive director of Doctors of the World, said: “The use of British taxpayers’ money on fences in France is ludicrous. Walls are not the answer to the humanitarian catastrophe in Calais. “They will not deter vulnerable refugees from seeking to have their asylum claim heard here. It is time for the UK to hear and settle those claims in France and end the suffering of ordinary people in search of a better life.”"
2016-12-09T14:08:42Z,Help Refugees: 'We will never abandon them',"“Please let me know if there’s anything you can do for this woman,” says the voice in the Whatsapp recording. “She’s about to give birth any day, she’s living in a tent, and the conditions are awful.” Driving through northern Greece on a recent December night, a pair of volunteers from the grassroots aid group Help Refugees have just received this SOS from another aid worker. It is 7.32pm, and a young Afghan refugee is about to go into labour at one of Greece’s worst refugee camps. It is a few dozen tents on a remote and windswept hillside – but the government and the UN refugee agency can’t move her anywhere better. Can Help Refugees? As the temperature drops to 3C, the group’s network whirs into action. A call goes out to Filoxenia, a housing project funded by Help Refugees, to see if it can take in the pregnant woman. Behind the wheel in the car, Crystallynn Steed Brown says if the worst comes to the worst, she will put up the family at her flat in Thessaloniki. But can they get to the woman in time? It is a typical night for Help Refugees, one of three beneficiaries of the Guardian’s Christmas charity appeal. The group is one of the unsung heroes of the European refugee crisis, a young grassroots collective that has tried to create a more dynamic form of aid in Calais and Greece, where even seasoned aid workers admit their traditional models have failed. “Some of the bigger NGOs are starting to realise how they can utilise us because of our flexibility,” says Brown, as she drives through the night. “The bigger the organisation, the more they get caught up in the bureaucracy – and so they often reach out to us to see if there’s anything we can do.” Help Refugees was founded in the late summer of 2015, after a group of friends decided to send a van of donations to Calais; it soon became one of the main suppliers of aid to northern France. With Calais now disbanded, the charity’s main focus has shifted to Greece, where about 50,000 refugees – 40% of them children – have been stranded in squalid and degrading camps since a shift in European migration policy in March. The EU, major NGOs and the Greek government have collectively failed to provide adequate conditions. Help Refugees is attempting to fill in the gaps, funding more than 20 grassroots groups that are working to alleviate the situation. Through its partners, Help Refugees provides food, infant care, safe spaces, building materials, building work and water infrastructure in dozens of camps; it funds rescue boats at sea; and organises housing for particularly vulnerable refugees. And it’s this that sends Brown hurtling in her Peugeot hatchback through Thessaloniki. By now, another aid worker has managed to bring the pregnant Afghan to a local hospital, and her son, Ali, has become the world’s youngest refugee. But if Help Refugees can’t intervene in time, there is a danger that both mother and child will be out in the snow again within a few days. Brown arrives after visiting hours are over, and is initially denied entry. But after grasping the desperate nature of the situation, the nurses relent, and Brown calmly explains to the mother what Help Refugees can do for her. “We will find you a place,” she says through a translator, also called Ali. “And if we can’t find you a place, you’ll sleep in my house.” Brown leaves the hospital relieved to have made contact. But back in the car, her mood is more subdued. “I try not to be too emotional in this work,” says Brown, a former ambulance worker from Idaho. “But it’s pretty messed up when you stop and think that I just held a brand new baby in my arms. And if we didn’t step in and do something about it, that baby is supposed to move back into a tent in two days in freezing conditions.” A visit to Oreokastro, a camp on the other side of Thessaloniki, hints at how dismal that would be. After passing the spot where Brown treated a refugee who tried to kill himself this summer, and another where a car recently ran over a Syrian child and his mother, we meet a Syrian father cradling his 10-day-old daughter. In the depths of winter, the newborn has been sent to live in a tent at this former cigarette factory. There is no electricity, and therefore no heating. A warmer tent has been erected for young mothers, but refugees say it has never been opened. All of which leaves the young father fearing for his daughter. “Children are dying from the cold,” says Abdulhalim al-Matlaq, a builder who fled the advance of Isis in Deir ez-Zor, eastern Syria. “There’s no heating. No money. It’s just garbage.” Matlaq and his extended family escaped Deir ez-Zor together last winter, and all 42 shared the same inflatable boat to Greece in February. They now occupy one long row of tents at Oreokastro, wondering if they will ever get to leave. They hoped to reach Germany, but the humanitarian corridor that once funnelled hundreds of thousands of Syrians through the Balkans closed in March. And in the months since, they have not been granted asylum elsewhere in Europe, due to the failure of the EU relocation scheme. This limbo has been particularly traumatic for their children, who are among hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees with no access to school across Europe and the Middle East. Yamamah, Matlaq’s cheery 11-year-old niece, says the camp is too dangerous for her siblings to visit the toilet alone at night. To pass the time, they watch YouTube videos on her father’s phone until they get tired. “We’re wasting our lives,” says Yamamah. Her father, minibus driver Abdulrazzaq, agrees: “It’s not even limbo, it’s five times worse than limbo. We’ve been here for 10 months, and it’s all a mystery. We don’t know if we’re going to another country, if our kids are going to get to study again, or have a future.” His brother Abdulhalim has more basic concerns for his own child; he fears the camp is simply too cold. It is this kind of challenge that Help Refugees is trying to alleviate where it can. A few miles away, in another gloomy former warehouse, the group provides crucial funding to Nurture Project International (NPI), a small charity that gives pre- and post-natal support to Kurdish mothers at the Kalochori camp. When we arrive, one nurse is teaching a Kurdish mother to wash her baby. A second nurse helps a 17-year-old refugee send breast milk to her premature daughter, who is still in hospital. “I never thought I’d have my first child in a place like this – it’s too cold here for a baby,” says Sonya, the young mother. “If NPI weren’t here, I’d be in a really bad situation.” The nurse, or international board certified lactation consultant, beams with affection. But in private, the tragedy of the situation looms larger. The conditions simply do not conform to western standards, says Fiona Lang-Sharpe. “You let go of many of the things that you know or you’ve learned, because you can’t go and buy things that you have at home,” she says, turning slightly emotional at the thought. “We will not leave them and we will not abandon them.” Ultimately, Help Refugees doesn’t just want to make the camps better, it wants refugees to leave the camps entirely. A glimpse of this vision can be found at a block of flats in another remote suburb of Thessaloniki. Most of the buildings here were never inhabited, having been built when the financial crisis first hit Greece in 2008. But one of them has just been occupied by Filoxenia to provide refugees with a warm flat to live in. Run by Samantha and Theo Nelson, former car dealers from Totnes, Devon, the building houses eight families in their own flats, and will soon welcome two more. After being cooped up in camps for months, the 54 residents can finally live in a greater degree of dignity. “There’s quiet here, there’s privacy, and this is your house,” says Bozan Ibo, a Syrian Kurd whose family was the first to move into Filoxenia six weeks ago. “You have your own key. It’s a normal life like it was in Syria.” His wife, Mezgin, smiles in agreement. They have a fruit bowl on the kitchen table, and a washing machine – two luxuries they haven’t experienced for months. “When I came here, I don’t know how to describe how I felt,” says Mezgin. “When I think about it I almost cry!” Mezgin thanks the Nelsons, who in turn thank Help Refugees for making the project happen. “Help Refugees helps with everything really,” says Samantha Nelson. “There’s their financial support, and also their support in general. They really understand what we’re trying to do.” • Click here to donate to our appeal"
2016-10-28T21:20:28Z,Revealed: the systemic exploitation of migrant workers in Australia,"For many, the promises vanish, and the exploitation begins, at the airport. They are young, some overseas for the first time, Korean students and workers, lured to Australia with promises of sun and fun, good, well-paying jobs, a chance to study or a working holiday. Instead, they find themselves housed in overcrowded hovels, indentured to labour in construction, late-night cleaning, or restaurants, under brutal conditions and for as little as $9 an hour. In many cases, workers have no contract, and no idea for whom they are ultimately working. In others, workers have their passports seized so they cannot leave. The Australian government’s fair work ombudsman says it has uncovered “persistent” underpayment of Korean workers in Australia, mainly in New South Wales, with at least 24 Korean businesses sanctioned in the past two years. Prof Allan Fels, the head of the government’s newly established migrant workers taskforce, told the Guardian that exploitation of migrant workers in Australia was “systemic … in that it is deeply embedded in the practices of some businesses”. Several Korean employers caught exploiting their staff have claimed they believed there was a below-award “going rate” for migrant workers, or relied on other Korean business owners to tell them what appropriate wages were. Meeting with the Guardian in inner Sydney, Joe Haln says he was regularly exploited in a series of jobs across Sydney – and sacked when he spoke up – and says exploitation within the close confines of the Korean community in Australia is rife. He says, in many cases, workers were controlled from the minute they arrive in Australia. “Agents are closely connected with the exploiters themselves, and everything is organised, right from the beginning. When people arrive at the airport there is somebody there to take them and put them in a van and take them to accommodation. It is accommodation, but it is like a slave camp.” “They are put in a room, seven or eight people to a room, to sleep, and then they are woken up very early in the morning and driven to the building site, they don’t even know where they are, they don’t know who they are working for, and they are made to start working.” “These are like forced labour camps, it is like slave labour, these people aren’t free at all.” Haln said in some cases migrant workers have their passports are taken from them. They are not given employment contracts, and there is no agreement on conditions or rates of pay. The face exorbitant deductions from the money that they are paid for rent, food, or other expenses. Others, particularly students studying in Australia, find jobs through the Korean local media, where jobs are advertised in Korean without any reference to award rates, or conditions. Some openly advertise pay rates as low as $12 an hour. The national minimum wage in Australia is $17.70 an hour. Haln is now president of the nascent Korean Workers Union, which aims to protect Korean migrant workers from the systemic abuse he says has exploited, and continues to exploit, thousands, and to inform new workers of their rights. He says workers are often kept in bleak conditions, crowded into already-overfull houses, especially in the Sydney suburbs of Strathfield and Lidcombe. “The accommodation is very bad, very bad. Seven or eight people in room, they cannot stretch their legs. Animals should not be kept like this, let alone people. “This is a cruelty, this is a brutality.” Many of the Korean workers in Australia are employed on construction sites, building residential apartments or office blocks, or by cleaning companies who have contracts to clean city offices overnight. Others take jobs in restaurants across the city. For many of those in construction, they work in jobs they are not properly trained for, and without protective equipment. Should they be injured, or seek to complain, they find themselves in a labyrinthine maze of contractors and subcontractors, an arcane chain to which there is no apparent end. “There is no paperwork, no contract,” Haln said. “People don’t even know who they are working for, so they don’t know who to complain to. Nobody takes any responsibility.” Student visa-holders in Australia are restricted to working 40 hours a fortnight during term - but are often compelled by employers to work far beyond that quota, and often at massively depressed rates of pay. Students find themselves compromised and, essentially, trapped: if they complain, or refuse to keep working, they are dismissed instantly, and they are unable to take their case to authorities because they know they are in breach of their visa conditions, and risk having their right to stay in Australia cancelled altogether. “Sometimes the employer says, ‘I will report you to immigration and you will be deported.’ There is nothing these people can do. They are very afraid,” Haln said. ‘I had to work more shifts or be sacked’ Esther Kim (not her real name) came to Australia to study business. She knew little of Australia beyond a reputation for sunshine and open spaces. As a qualified chef, she quickly found work in a Sydney Korean restaurant to support herself through her studies. Her student visa mandated she work no more than 40 hours a fortnight. “But the boss told me I had to work more shifts, many more shifts than 20 hours a week, or they will sack me. And they said I will not be able to get any other job, they will tell other employers not to hire me, the say I won’t get a job anywhere.” “I was being paid $15 an hour – [the award is, at a minimum, $23.64] – but I was under the threat to get sacked, I couldn’t complain to anyone. They knew I was working more than 20 hours a week, and they said, ‘We will report you to immigration and you will be deported.’” She said working conditions were oppressive: staff were shouted at and abused, told they were hopeless and constantly threatened they would be dismissed for “working too slowly”. Kim told the Guardian she and other workers were abused regularly: “They said, ‘You fucking idiot’, ‘You whore,’ ‘You are stupid’” She says restaurant staff were kept in a climate of fear. “We work like slaves, always ‘quick, quick, quick’. And we have no time to eat lunch, or dinner, or go to the toilet. “We are always afraid, they like to keep us fearful. We are always very tired, very afraid.” Kim says she stopped eating, lost significant amounts of weight, and couldn’t sleep for the stress. “I ended up crying, many, many times. “I expected Australians to be respectful, respecting women and workers, but these are Korean people doing this, not Australians. They are exploiting other Koreans because they know they can, and there is no way we can complain.” The myth of ‘the going rate’ Haln says Korean workers were particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of a number of factors, particularly: Language – many Korean workers, when they arrive in Australia, don’t speak strong English and so would struggle to find work outside the Korean community. If they upset one employer in the close-knit Korean community they fear being blacklisted by all employees as troublemakers. Cultural – there is not a culture of worker organisation in Korea. Unions in the Republic of Korea are seen as political, radical and anti-government, so few workers arrive in Australia with a history or connection with organised labour. Naivety – many who arrive are unaware – and are kept unaware by the exploitative nature of their employment – of Australia’s legal protections for workers, award rates or conditions, and other legal employer obligations, such as safety equipment. There are now in Australia at any time about 1 million people on temporary residence visas with rights to work – mainly working holiday makers, 457 visa holders, students and New Zealanders. According to census figures, there are more than 75,000 Koreans living in Australia, more than half of those in Sydney. Fewer than 10% speak English at home. The office of the fair work ombudsman says it has uncovered a string of cases involving exploitation of Korean workers over the past two years, dominated by “persistent underpayment” of workers. Several migrant employers have told the ombudsman they undercut minimum wage rates because they paid agoing rate for overseas workers. The ombudsman, Natalie James, says the so-called “going rate” for overseas workers of any nationality is a myth that must be dispelled. James says it is illegal for employers to arbitrarily set and pay low, flat rates of pay, and that minimum wage rates apply to everyone in Australia – including visa holders – and are not negotiable. Last year the operator of a Korean restaurant in Sydney told the fair work ombudsman he advertised for staff for as little as $12 an hour because he feared retribution from competitors if he offered the award rate. The restaurateur told of pressure from the Korean business community to recruit workers at below-award wages and revealed that businesses which did not comply feared retribution. Another Korean national who started a business in Australia relied on other business owners in the Korean community to set his pay rate. “While I understand there are cultural challenges and vastly different laws in other parts of the world, it is important for business people operating here to understand and apply Australian laws,” James says. In the wake of the 7-Eleven scandal – where franchisees were discovered to be paying as little as $5 an hour to workers – the minister for employment, Michaelia Cash, announced the establishment of a migrant workers taskforce, charged with weeding out and reforming worker exploitation in the Australian economy. “A number of recent high-profile cases where vulnerable migrant workers have been underpaid and exploited at work have exposed unacceptable gaps in the system,” Cash said. “While the government acknowledges that the majority of employers do the right thing by their employees, we will not tolerate exploitation in Australian workplaces.” The government has also increased fines for employers who exploit workers, as well as increasing funding for the office of the fair work ombudsman, and strengthening its powers. The former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head Prof Alan Fels, who has been appointed to chair the taskforce, says migrant workers are “highly exploitable” and vulnerable on a number of levels. “They are willing to work for low pay, because that’s better than no work at all, their bargaining power is weak, and they generally have a lack of knowledge about Australian conditions and award rates. “It’s also the case that they are generally not unionised, and there might be other ties, family ties, cultural ties, or an obligation around their visa, that means they are vulnerable to exploitation.” He says the vast majority of exploited workers come from South Asia, China and Korea. Fels’ taskforce – which will include representation from the departments of immigration, employment, education, as well as the tax office, attorney general’s office, the border force and the fair work ombudsman – has a broad remit to identify the systemic “weakness that create the conditions that allow exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers … and make improvements to stamp out exploitation”. Dave Oliver, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, says while any measures to reduce exploitation of foreign workers are welcome, the government’s measures are “too little, too late”. “Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and minister Cash have spent the past three years saying that there are no problems with our temporary skilled migration schemes. “Unfortunately, the evidence available from our affiliated unions and other sources is that both Australian and overseas workers are being disadvantaged and migrant workers are exploited on a regular basis under the current policy and program settings that govern temporary work visas.” Oliver says the taskforce membership should include representation from unions, non-governmental organisations and community groups “who help migrant workers on an everyday basis”. “Since the new modern slavery and labour trafficking provisions came into force in 2013, the department of immigration has not prosecuted one employer. More vigorous safeguards need to be in place to protect the interests of overseas workers on temporary visas.”"
2016-12-01T13:35:01Z,Canada prepares for surge of Mexican immigrants after visa lift and Trump win,"Officials in Canada are readying for a potential surge in Mexican migrants, as a promise to scrap a visa requirement comes into effect amid uncertainty over Donald Trump’s promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants. From Thursday, Mexican visitors to Canada will no longer need visas. The move has left the government anticipating an increase in Mexican tourists and business travellers, a spokesperson for Canada’s immigration ministry said. The visa was put in place in 2009 by the previous Conservative government to address an increase in what it described as bogus refugee claims. But the timing of the visa lift – following on the heels of Trump’s vows to expel millions of illegal immigrants – has sparked concerns among officials that Canada could again see a substantial increase in Mexican asylum seekers, government sources told the Guardian. Between 2005 and 2008, Canadian officials said refugee claims from Mexico nearly tripled, making Mexico the number one source country for claims. Of the more than 9,400 claims filed by Mexicans in 2008, just 11% were accepted. The visa was embraced as a means of border control by the Conservative government. “The visa requirement I am announcing will give us a greater ability to manage the flow of people into Canada,” the then immigration minister Jason Kenney said in a statement. “In addition to creating significant delays and spiralling new costs in our refugee program, the sheer volume of these claims is undermining our ability to help people fleeing real persecution.” After the visa was introduced, the number of Mexican asylum seekers plunged – dropping to 120 in 2015 – but the Canadian government came under tremendous political pressure from Mexico to end the policy. In June, the government agreed to do so, in exchange for Mexico expanding its imports of Canadian beef. “This move will make it easier for our Mexican friends to visit Canada, while growing our local economies and strengthening our communities,” Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said at the time. At the time, few had considered the possibility that Trump – who had vowed to build a wall along the shared border between the US and Mexico and deport millions of undocumented workers and illegal residents – would win the US election. If Trump carries through on those pledges, it could result in a substantial impact on Canada, said Toronto immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman. “It’s the lifting of the visa and the fact that Trump is going to take over, those two factors together are seen as a major pull factor attracting people to come to Canada.” He drew parallels with another wave of migrants that headed north in recent years. “After 9/11, when there was a significant crackdown in the United States on Muslims, there was a significant number of people who came across the border from the United States into Canada at that time.” Others disputed whether the visa lift and Trump presidency would result in a substantial increase in Mexican migrants to Canada. “I imagine there will be some increase, perhaps to numbers similar to before the Great Recession hit,” said César Cuauhtémoc of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. “The reality, however, is that many Mexicans have strong reasons – family ties and longstanding economic relationships are two of the most prominent – to set their sights on the United States despite the difficult path to lawful migration.” Net migration from Mexico to the US has dropped over recent years, thanks to tougher enforcement on the border and a relatively stable jobs market. But Trump’s election victory – and his promises to tear up existing trade agreements and impose stiff import duties – have caused the peso to plunge and sparked fears of an economic crisis in Mexico. Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship has downplayed any concerns, arguing that the visa lift will yield deeper ties between Canada and Mexico and boost tourism. “We are very happy to welcome more Mexican tourists to this country and to accept the jobs that go along with that,” John McCallum recently told the House of Commons. “Of course we knew there were risks. There are risks when you do anything.” The government will continue to closely monitor migration from Mexico, he said, and could move to reinstate the visa if it sees a spike in the number of Mexican asylum seekers. “There would come a point where a visa could be reimposed,” he said. “Canada retains its sovereignty on this issue. There comes a point where it would become unsustainable, but we are hoping that point will not arrive.”"
2016-10-18T06:00:31Z,Survey finds 70% of migrants arriving in Europe by boat trafficked or exploited,"More than 70% of migrants travelling overland through north Africa to Europe have become victims of human trafficking, organ trafficking and exploitation along the way, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The IOM’s surveys of migrants arriving in Europe by boat reveal that nearly three-quarters of those interviewed show strong indicators of having been trafficked or exploited for profit by criminals at some point on their journey. Nearly half of all those questioned (49%) reported being held in a location against their will, often for ransom. The majority of these cases occurred in Libya. Half of migrants said they had worked without pay, with many being threatened with weapons by an employer or labour broker. Others said that forced labour was the only way of being freed from captivity or securing a place on a boat to Europe. The surveys also revealed an emerging trend of organ and blood trafficking: 6% of all respondents reported that they had experience of someone being forced to give blood against their will or while captive, or of organs being used as payment for parts of the journey. According to the surveys, men are more likely to have fallen victim to human trafficking than women, although the IOM did not ask specific questions about forced prostitution or trafficking for sexual exploitation. The surveys also show that the longer someone is in transit, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited or trafficked, with migrants who spent six months or more journeying to Europe three times more likely to have fallen prey to criminal exploitation than those who were in transit countries for less than two weeks. The IOM spent 10 months gathering data from more than 9,000 migrants (pdf – NB, this shows data for just three months) on the central and eastern Mediterranean routes. As well as collecting information on the prevalence of forced labour and organ trafficking, the surveys also asked about marriage, and forced marriage, while in transit. Fewer than 1.5% of respondents said they had received an offer of marriage in exchange for money along the route. On the eastern Mediterranean route – where migrants travel overland via Turkey and Greece – 14% of migrants reported signs of human trafficking and exploitation. About 6% reported being held against their will, 7% said they worked without pay. As many as 4% said they were forced into work against their will, most of these instances occurring in Turkey. Incidents of organ and blood trafficking were reported in Turkey, Greece, Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. The IOM said its surveys are the first attempt to quantify the prevalence, scale and frequency of labour and other forms of human trafficking on the major migrant routes. “What these surveys show is that human trafficking networks are becoming brutal and efficient at exploiting and making profit from the vulnerability of migrants,” says Simona Moscarelli, anti-trafficking expert at the IOM. “There is still very little real recognition of the scale of this business or just how much money is being made from the misery and labour of people fleeing war or poverty.” Kevin Hyland, the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the surveys provide further evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable. “There is a need for urgent action to protect these people,” he says. “I believe that a key focus for the UK and other governments must include collaborating with partners to prioritise safeguarding against the risks of modern slavery as part of the response to the migration and refugee crisis.”"

It is not hard to see why. Other theatres might turn to the subject of people who come to London from elsewhere, though not many have done so. Few would give it the straight-from-the-heart, intimate treatment it gets at Battersea. And where else would the people who tell these stories be the people who lived them? Perched on a bed, within touching distance of her audience, a woman speaks of the search for her mother that sent her from Suffolk to Kuwait, from Iran to London. She is clenched, compelled. She describes standing in a sandstorm in a graveyard in Iran, being yelled at because her head is not covered. She talks of finally finding people who look like her – only to have doors slammed in her face. She was never listened to. Now she is. There are stories of leaving Syria, Jamaica, China – and Auschwitz. A Mexican woman twinkles as she remembers her exhilaration at finding a new language and independence in London. A walking stick lies by her chair, but you can see the dancer she has been as she gestures gracefully towards the grey clouds she has come to love. Altogether there are more than 20 accounts: you can visit six in one session. The experience is carefully layered. Newspaper headlines are pasted on the walls: “German Jews pouring in” – the Daily Mail, 1944. Cards are handed out with deft accounts of migration to London over five centuries. And at the end is a telling exhibition: a collection of objects that are important to the storytellers. A scatter of shells from Greece. A turquoise and indigo tile from Iran.

2016-11-30T04:57:50Z,Coalition's secret visa plan 'risks increasing violent extremism',"A secret Coalition plan to create a class of provisional visas with less access to social services may undermine resettlement of refugees, reduce social cohesion and increase the risk of violent extremism, according to a leaked government document. Speaking at question time, Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged the authenticity of the “protected” document, first revealed by Fairfax Media on Wednesday, and said the leak had been referred to the Australian federal police. The minute dated 23 November, prepared for the Department of Social Services (DSS) secretary, Finn Pratt, records a meeting with immigration officials at which DSS raised numerous concerns with the plan. Consideration of the proposal began on 1 March when the national security committee of cabinet agreed to a “new simplified visa framework”. The minute said the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was seeking cabinet agreement for a new system with eight types of visas. It discusses a visa change proposal including a “provisional visa system”, and warns that removing or altering the social safety net for those under this system may impact social cohesion and productivity. “DSS is concerned that the proposed reforms risk undermining Australia’s social cohesion and potentially increase the risk factors that may lead to violent extremism,” it said. DSS is working with the immigration department “on costing six options for access to social security payments and identifying associated savings and social impacts”. In the document, DSS recommended that “humanitarian entrants be excluded from any social security changes”, indicating that the proposal under consideration is to alter or remove social security payments or services from visa holders including refugees. It said delayed access to welfare would be harmful to the most vulnerable migrants, such as refugees and those who experienced domestic violence. Social security support was “key to [the] successful long-term settlement” of people on humanitarian visas, it said. The note said the immigration department had begun engaging with other departments on the plan “which will reframe temporary, provisional and permanent migration and citizenship”. But it noted DSS’s concern that “changing the longstanding national narrative to one which treats all migrants with suspicion does not best leverage migrants’ willingness and potential to contribute”. DSS argued that people who opted for a “provisional pathway to permanence” are not the same as temporary residents and should receive “better treatment in terms of payments and supports than those not making any ongoing commitment to Australia”. The minute noted DSS’s concern the proposed timeline for the reform is “too short”. It said that savings may be “not as significant” as the immigration department expected, but the costs would be “huge”. Asked about the document in question time, Turnbull said it was “not a cabinet document” but it was a document “exchanged between bureaucrats” that dealt with matters “to be submitted to cabinet”. “The secretary, Mr Pratt, is conducting an investigation,” he said. Turnbull said the leak should be referred to the AFP then, after question time was delayed by 15 minutes by a noisy and well-coordinated protest by refugee activists, he added he was advised it had now been referred. The Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said the proposed visa changes discussed in the document are “deeply xenophobic” and a continuation of Dutton’s “attack on multiculturalism in Australia”. “This is nothing less than a blueprint to return our country to the divisive days of the White Australia Policy,” he said. Revelation of the proposed plan comes two weeks after Dutton said it was a “mistake” for Malcolm Fraser to let in certain groups of refugees in the 1970s, later specifying Lebanese Muslims in particular. During the election, Dutton controversially suggested that migrants were illiterate and would take Australian jobs. Senior government figures including Turnbull and deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, defended the remarks, arguing the immigration minister was simply acknowledging the high cost of resettlement services including English classes."
2016-12-17T20:17:56Z,TUC and businesses urge Theresa May to act on rights of migrants,"British business and the trade union movement have made an unprecedented joint demand to Theresa May to guarantee immediately the rights of European Union migrants to remain in the UK, warning that further uncertainty will inflict serious damage on the British economy. In a strongly worded letter to the prime minister, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), representing companies with a combined workforce of 5 million employees, and the TUC say that more delays will be bad for business, families, local communities, and public services, such as the NHS. At an EU summit in Brussels last week, May told EU leaders that she wanted a decision about the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK, as well as the more than a million UK residents in other EU states, to be made as soon as possible – but only after formal talks are triggered in March next year. However, in their letter sent to Downing Street on Saturday, the BCC and TUC demand that May “demonstrate leadership” with a “bold move” now that will end the worry and uncertainty for millions of people, and for companies, whose futures have been thrown into doubt by the 23 June Brexit vote. The BCC and TUC say that many EU citizens are already leaving the UK and more will follow unless a decision is made imminently. They say that migrants should no longer be used as bargaining chips in Brexit negotiations, but instead be given “the reassurance we would expect to be shown to UK citizens across the Continent”. In their letter, BCC director general Adam Marshall and TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady say: “The business communities and workers we represent across the United Kingdom share a deep and abiding concern for the rights of EU citizens currently living and working in this country.” They write: “Today, we urge you to break the deadlock – and give an unequivocal commitment that EU citizens working here will have a permanent right to remain in the UK. “We recognise that this would be a bold unilateral move, particularly before the start of a complex Brexit negotiation. But it is the right move for these workers, for the businesses that employ them, for the Exchequer, and for the UK economy as a whole. “It would also send a clear signal to our colleagues and to our European friends that Britain is committed to doing the right thing. Securing EU citizens’ right to remain would provide much-needed certainty for businesses, working people, their families and local communities. “In addition, the government must hold to account the small number of unethical employers who exploit migrant workers to undercut pay and conditions of employment.” So far, the government has stuck to its line that it will not guarantee the rights of European Union migrants in this country until those of British citizens in other EU states are also confirmed. O’Grady told the Observer: “This uncertainty is hugely worrying for working people and their families who have made Britain their home. “It’s the right thing to do. But it’s also about what is right for Britain, too. Continued doubt about the status of workers from the rest of the EU is bad for business, and it puts services like the NHS at risk. “The government must also crack down on the minority of employers who exploit migrants and undercut wages in the local community.” Marshall said: “Business communities across the UK are deeply frustrated that ministers have declined to guarantee the residence rights of their EU employees and colleagues. Some firms are already losing key members of their staff as a result of this avoidable uncertainty.” According to the Office for National Statistics, 2.1 million EU nationals were employed in the UK in the first quarter of 2016 – 224,000 more than in the same period in 2015."
2016-11-28T15:06:06Z,Refugee comedy is German box office sensation,"A comedy about the refugee crisis has become Germany’s biggest homegrown film of the year. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Willkommen bei den Hartmanns (Welcome to the Hartmanns) – which follows a well-to-do woman’s decision to take in an African refugee – has broken the $20m barrier at the German box office. This puts it some distance ahead of the second-placed Der Geilste Tag (The Most Beautiful Day) as the most successful German language film of 2016 at the domestic box office. Willkommen bei den Hartmanns stars Senta Berger as retired headteacher Angelika and Belgian actor Eric Kabongo as Diallo, the Nigerian she meets in a refugee shelter. Angelika’s decision to offer him a home triggers a series of life-changing events in her family. The film makes an explicit reference to Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to welcome large numbers of refugees into Germany. Angelika’s husband, resistant to her plans, at one point says: “It’s enough for Frau Merkel to invite the entire third world into our country – we’re not going to do the same in our home as well.” The film’s director is Simon Verhoeven, Berger’s son with Michael Verhoeven, award-winning director of the 1990 film The Nasty Girl (and no relation to Dutch director Paul Verhoeven)."
2016-10-20T20:15:10Z,Sonita review – a refugee's dreams of superstardom,"Like many other 18-year-old girls, spirited Sonita Alizadeh wants to be a star and rap about her life. In her dreams, Michael Jackson and Rihanna are her parents and she’s free to pursue her recording career. In reality, as revealed in this wrenching, delicately told documentary, she’s a refugee from Afghanistan living in exile in Tehran, whose while her family back home are arranging to sell her off in matrimony for $9,000. If she won’t go along with the plan, they will beat her until she does, like the families of so many of her friends at the Tehran centre for refugee girls. Her mother is willing to give her a six-month stay of execution if someone like the centre or even the film-makers themselves – like so many Iranian films, this one also operates on a meta level – agree to pay $2,000. Despite the fact it’s illegal for women to sing in public in Iran, eventually Sonita makes a video of one of her songs with help from director Rokhsareh Ghaemmaghami, and that changes the whole story. What’s especially laudable is that the film never oversells her talent: there are scenes of recording industry professionals coolly assessing her work, and telling her she has a lot to learn. But the kid is a force of nature, and it’s impossible not to be swept along by the powerful tide of her story."
2016-11-17T10:29:24Z,Verifying refugees' stories: why is it so difficult?,"As the refugee crisis rumbles on and tensions continue to rise over which countries should take in more people, one question comes up repeatedly. How can you tell whether asylum seekers are telling the truth? The system hangs on the idea that officials can tell the difference between a legitimate and a false claim, and that claims can be easily split into these two categories. “At the registration interview [the initial interview] you ask asylum seekers for details. You ask for their names, names of relatives, university, education, birthplace, occupation, and the reason they believe they can no longer live in their country of origin,” says Alan, who used to interview Iraqi and Syrian asylum seekers to determine whether they should be granted refugee status. “You’re trying to get the narrative with as many details as possible for the later refugee status determination interview [RSD].” The information goes into the claimant’s file, which allows workers to compare it with anything they may say later. Up to two years may elapse between the initial interview and the RSD. When the asylum seeker is finally brought before the panel, refugees will be quizzed about their stories and asked to explain their background in more detail. These interviews can last for up four hours. The refugee may be speaking through interpreters, which adds the potential for misunderstandings. The people assessing the case will have used the time in between the first interview and the RSD to compile as many documents as possible to check that the story matches up with events in their country. Everything the interviewee says in the RSD will then be meticulously checked against what they said in the registration interview. In theory it is a robust, if terribly slow, system. But the reality is that the rhetoric that often accompanies claims about bogus asylum seekers doesn’t take into account the fragility of the system. “It’s so subjective,” says Alan. “It’s all in the hands of human beings – there’s no machine.” In fact, checking the credibility of a refugee’s story can be very difficult as they might not be able to relay it properly. Factors such as illiteracy, severe trauma, memory loss and old age can complicate matters considerably, as they are less likely to remember or clearly communicate their story. Sometimes, they are just given a pen and paper and asked to draw what happened. Flaws can show up in the simplest things. People may have fled due to religious persecution, for example. But the UNHCR guidelines for questioning their faith explicitly state that the refugee may have fled persecution without knowing much about their religion at all. Children’s stories, likewise, are expected to include inconsistencies. Guidelines state that just because stories are conflicting, it doesn’t mean they’re untrue. “There are specific ways of checking the credibility of stories,” says Alan. “You can’t destroy the climate of trust. Interviewers must be tactful.” They need to try to clarify discrepancies and if they’re not convinced or the stories don’t add up, and the client has the right to explain anything that may have been misconstrued. Documentation helps. “However, forgery happens all the time, especially with military booklets,” says Alan. “They all start to know the process. They will know if you’re with a certain department in the military you’re more likely to get refugee status. A few years ago every Iraqi refugee would claim they were a cook in the army.” This story was so common that interviewers devised a special cook questionnaire, asking what they would cook and the times of the meals. Organisations say they are equipping their workers with the knowledge to make the outcome as fair as possible. “There are ways of making it an accurate process – there’s no way it’s 100% definite,” says Jean-Pierre Schembri, head of communications at the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). “There are means of getting close to the real answer.” EASO provides specific training and teaches interviewing techniques, as well as how to deal with vulnerable people. They have trained over 14,000 people so far. There have long been rumours that people from other countries claim to be Syrian in order to be fast tracked, but Schembri says it would be difficult for an asylum seeker to maintain that lie as the interview is led by people with local knowledge: “They ask him which street he lives on, then what is on the corner of that street, whether there is a mosque nearby. If he doesn’t know, it’s obvious this person is not from where he says.” Knowledge of language, dialect, tribes all play a part too. Is it possible that refugees awaiting their interviews rehearse false answers in order to be fast tracked? “It’s more complicated than that – there won’t be the same questions for everyone,” Schembri says. He argues that it’s unlikely that, for example, a Syrian would coach someone from Afghanistan. “The nationalities tend to stick together and we’re seeing more fighting between different groups… But I’m not saying that it never happens.” A certain percentage of asylum claims are rejected because of a lack of credibility, but that statistic is not kept on file. That doesn’t stop government and media organisations guessing how many asylum seekers have fabricated stories, however. “Last year in Germany there were claims by officials that refugees were lying about their nationality – at first they said 30% of people who said they were Syrian were not, then that number later dropped much lower,” says Minos Mouzourakis, Asylum Information Database coordinator at European Council on Refugees and Exiles. Around the struggle to get refugees accurately assessed, there is a tug in two directions between getting asylum seekers out of squalid refugee camps and ensuring that the complex process of background checks is done thoroughly. With 50,000 migrants awaiting a decision in Greece alone and the refugee camp in Calais being shut down, there is no doubt the backlog needs to be cleared in a fair and efficient way. Greece shows what happens when this process is sluggish. Thousands of people are still waiting for an answer that could take years to come, living in freezing tents, with no money and poor facilities. Borders have closed, and huge numbers of refugees and migrants are unable to move anywhere. Agapi Chouzouraki, a lawyer for the Greek Council for Refugees, points out that the waiting periods are unacceptably long even for this initial brief registration interview. “There are people that have an appointment for the registration of their application in six or seven months, and they have already spent eight to 12 months waiting,” Chouzouraki points out. “And that date will be only the beginning of the process, meaning they will have to wait long after their appointment, perhaps three to 12 months regarding the case. The utterly basic problem, of course, still remains and is the living conditions in the camps, especially for members of vulnerable groups, as people are ‘hosted’ in structures that were designed to be only temporary.” Extra staff are being laid on to ease these bottlenecks. But this could bring new problems when it comes to credibility, says Alan. “They have started employing so many people because the numbers [of asylum seekers] are insane. You are supposed to have a background in law and to understand the process and the legal requirements and know what you’re looking for. There is a level of empathy you need to do this job correctly.” He is unsure if this criteria is met by all of the latest recruits. Without the necessary background and large amounts of research, the already imperfect process may suffer, he says. Refugees have the right to appeal decisions, but in Greece the process has changed so it’s easier to deport asylum seekers to Turkey. “Following the latest reform, the committee is composed of two Greek judges from the administrative court and an expert taken from a list compiled by the UNHCR and appointed by the state,” says Mouzourakis. “What is interesting with this, and points to the political nature of the process, is that the committees were different a couple of months ago – beforehand you had one ministry official, a UNHCR expert and a third member who was a human rights expert.” This exposes how elastic the system is. The change in the panel means that it’s much more likely that asylum seekers will be returned to Turkey, where it is deemed to be safe since the EU deal, rather than being given asylum in Europe. In the end, it’s asylum seekers who live with the consequences of moving goalposts and whether their story meets the criteria. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s the only one we have. • This article was amended on 17 November 2016 to correct a quote from Minos Mouzourakis.

2016-12-22T17:13:22Z,'No one chooses to be a refugee': pictures from a Greek crisis,"Last year, 22-year-old Alice Aedy decided to board a plane to Greece. She arrived in the north and signed up as a volunteer for Help Refugees, Europe’s largest grassroots distributor of aid. A self-taught documentary photographer, she quietly produced a moving body of work over the course of a year. “I have captured moments of grief and suffering, but mostly I found dignity and often joy,” she says of the experience. We spoke to Aedy about her journey across Greece, supporting some of the 60,000 refugees stranded in harsh, often unimaginable, conditions. “Meeting the innocent victims of this crisis has reminded me of our extraordinary capacity to turn a blind eye. To ignore our responsibility to help those caught up in a war fought at their expense,” she reflects. “They didn’t choose to be refugees. No one wants to be a refugee.” Here, Aedy shares some of the stories behind her portraits. “Reem carries her child over the train tracks in the Idomeni refugee camp, where she lived for four months after leaving Deir ez-Zor in Syria. She left a good life, she told me. She was an English teacher and her husband was a university professor.” “I met sisters Maesa, Milaf and Zayneb Omar on my second day volunteering in the Idomeni refugee camp. A Kurdish family of six from al-Qamishli, Syria, they lived in a two-man tent for four months. “With absolutely nothing to do, our days were structured around meal times. A common misconception about refugees is that they don’t have smartphones. In fact, their phones are a crucial way to stay in touch with family and one of the only forms of entertainment in camps where there is nothing to do.” “This is Zayneb, a seven-year-old Kurdish girl from from al-Qamishli, Syria. This photo shows her playing dress-up with her mother. Zayneb suffers from severe night terrors and her mother regularly loses consciousness. “One evening, her mother fell unconscious for about five minutes. When I called for medical assistance I was told it was the result of stress and there was nothing we could do. After this, they became classified as a vulnerable case and were recently moved to a one-bedroom apartment. While living outside of camp is undeniably a better option, it is in some ways a double-edged sword. As more families move off-site, the crisis becomes less visible and it’s a greater challenge for NGOs to keep track of the families, give them access to education, medical care and food.” “I took this photo of three-month-old Zuheira following a few days of snow in northern Greece. Many of the camps in Greece are inadequately prepared for winter: in warehouses without insulation, heating or flooring. While a child might be born in hospital, the mother has to return to the camp immediately, despite the shocking conditions.” “I grew very close to Milaf during my time working in the camp and have returned several times to Greece to visit her and her family. I have followed her on the different stages of her journey: from Idomeni to a military camp, and now to an apartment. A day would rarely go by where she didn’t mention how she missed Syria. I often think about how she will look back at this time in her life when she is older. I wonder how the trauma of the whole experience will affect her long-term.” “This is Abdulrazzaq Matlaq with Batul, his four-year-old daughter, in Oreokastro military camp in northern Greece. It’s hard to believe they have been in the same tent for eight months. “We often talk about children as the ultimate victims of this crisis, but for parents who feel they have failed their children, the grief can be tangible. He was a mini-bus driver and fled Syria last winter with his daughters and wife. I have remained very close with Yamamah, his 11-year-old daughter whom I often speak with and message via WhatsApp. In Arabic, her name means “dove”. When I asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up she said: ‘A journalist, so I can be like you.’” “This photo was taken in a military camp called Softex, widely regarded as the worst military camp in northern Greece. The heat was overwhelming and this woman complained about the inadequate portions of food provided by the military. I will never forget her eyes. Of the 60,000 refugees in Greece, approximately 9,000 are pregnant women. Their babies will be born ‘stateless’, without citizenship. Reports from this camp of self-harm, drug and sexual abuse, human trafficking, theft and child prostitution are all too frequent.” “I came across this urban square by accident as I drove through Thessaloniki. An Afghan family lived there that was entirely reliant on grassroots organisations for food and water. They told me that because they were Afghan and not Syrian, they weren’t allowed into a camp. We seem to have created an illegitimate dichotomy and hierarchy between ‘legitimate’ and ‘illegitimate’ migrants, in which children aren’t considered as the innocent victims of conflict that they are.” “I photographed this boy on the day the Greek military began evicting people from the Idomeni refugee camp. Thousands had to pack their belongings and prepare to move to an unknown destination. The uncertainty felt paralysing to them and initially many residents of the camp refused to leave until they were physically forced.” “This is three-year-old Maesa Omar in the Idomeni refugee camp. She is pictured here hiding from the rain under one of the few covered areas in the camp, which regularly became badly flooded. Forty percent of the camp’s residents were children under the age of 12.” • Click here to donate to our appeal for child refugees"
2016-10-10T06:00:33Z,The Brits helping refugees help Britain,"Britain’s referendum decision to leave the EU was seen in some quarters as a damning verdict on immigration. But while some see incomers as a threat and a drain, others recognise that many refugees come with skills, ambitions and ideas that should not be wasted. Getting refugees working in the NHS When Aster Yehayes first arrived in Leeds in the back of a lorry crammed with chemicals and seven other people, she didn’t know what country she was in, let alone what the future held for her. She was alone and destitute, with only the clothes on her back and no grasp of the English language. A month before, she had escaped wrongful imprisonment in Eritrea and walked day and night through the Sahara desert to reach Sudan, where her uncle lived. He told her she couldn’t stay and found a man who trafficked her to England. She was taken to the police station in Leeds where she was put in detention. “I knew I was illegal, but I couldn’t believe I had escaped prison just to be put in prison again,” says Yehayes. It was while she was locked in a police cell that she prayed: if God kept her safe and alive, she would dedicate her life to helping others. She could never have imagined while sitting on a plastic mattress, afraid to drink a cup of tea for fear that it was dirty water, that nine years later she would be working for the NHS – an institution regarded as a national treasure in her adopted home. Yehayes, 35, is one of eight women who have got jobs as apprentice or qualified healthcare assistants at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust with the help of the Hidden Talents programme, which aims to open doors for people who might not know how to apply and interview for roles in the health service. All of those on the programme are refugees or women who have come to the UK on a spousal visa to join their husband, who is often himself an asylum seeker. Despite being enthusiastic and experienced, these women often find it difficult to get work because of barriers such as a lack of confidence and knowledge around how to fill in application forms. Gill Chapman, lead nurse for nursing and midwifery workforce, who heads the project at the trust, says: “Within our community, there are a number of people who are finding it difficult to access employment. They want to work within the trust but through the normal processes they’ve not been successful.” Nationwide, there is a high vacancy rate in nursing; Leeds is no exception and this scheme also helps the trust meets its staffing requirements. Chapman adds: “It’s a win-win.” Chapman insists that entry requirements for roles have not been compromised. The trust held a workshop to talk the women through the application process, and guaranteed them an interview or a place at the assessment centre. The rest was up to them and their mentors. That was all that was needed for Nadege Demgne, 37, from Cameroon, who had applied for jobs at the trust several times without success. With a little support she is now a qualified healthcare assistant on a midwifery ward. Her life now is a far cry from when she fled Cameroon as a 17-year-old because she faced forced marriage to a 75-year-old man. She says with a beaming smile: “It’s a great opportunity for me. I never dreamed about doing this. Since I started, I’m thinking about going forward, becoming a midwife – why not?” Diako Lebakeng, 39, first came to the UK 17 years ago, from Johannesburg to join her Nigerian husband, who was seeking asylum. Her life has been filled with trials and because of stress she has lost most of her hair. She was recently granted leave to remain for two and a half years; the judge looked favourably on the fact that she had this apprenticeship open for her. “To be honest with you, it’s hard to explain the feeling,” says Lebakeng. “Wow. I can’t wait. Before, it was just darkness. With this opportunity we’ve been given, it’s like opening the road for us and there’s a light of promise there coming through.” Sarah Johnson The volunteer chefs In a cafe kitchen, a young woman arranges pieces of chicken on a bed of rice and stirs yoghurt into a salad of tomatoes, chickpeas and garlic. Her mother takes a tray of rich, oily aubergine slices from the oven. They are rustling up their version of the Middle Eastern dish maklouba. On the other side of the hatch, anticipation is growing as lunchtime approaches. “I’ve been here since 10am,” says a woman sitting at one of half a dozen round tables. “I’m starving.” This is one of a growing number of volunteer-run cafes across the UK using food that would otherwise be thrown away to create nutritious meals for people who are hungry, lonely or marginalised. But the remarkable difference at All Hallows, an Anglican church in Leeds, is that the food is being cooked by recently arrived Syrian Muslim refugees, many of whom have gone through traumatic experiences but who now want to make a contribution in their new and unfamiliar home. Salam al-Khatib, 22, who practises saying the word garlic as she crushes cloves, has been in the UK for two months following four years in Lebanon after her family left their home in Homs in 2011. She came to Leeds with her parents, two brothers and a sister under the UK’s resettlement programme. “Everyone has welcomed us here, everyone has been very friendly,” she says in Arabic, translated by Hala Wadi, a Palestinian English teacher who has been in the UK for 10 months. “My mum and I volunteered to cook at the cafe. I loved the idea of sharing our food with others.” Over the course of several hours, some 60 people are fed the Khatibs’ signature dishes. Dashing between the tables to refill water jugs and clear plates is Heston Groenewald, the vicar of All Hallows for the past 18 months – his “first proper grown-up vicar job” since being ordained five years ago, he says. The church has run The Real Junk Food Project – where people pay what they can, or in kind by washing up or weeding the garden – for the past two years, building up from one day a week to four or five. The idea to hand over the kitchen to Syrian refugees one day a week came out of discussions with members of the local mosque. “All Hallows is a very inclusive, open church,” says Groenewald, who says he thinks the government response to the refugee crisis has been inadequate.“We should have a mindset of generosity rather than austerity. If only we could think in terms of brothers and sisters, of friendships which sprout and flourish, rather than foreigners.” Alaa Abdul Jaleel, 28, came to All Hallows by accident. “I was looking for a conversation club [to help learn English], but my feet brought me here,” she says while feeding her 18-month old daughter, Sarah, who was born in Turkey a few months after Abdul Jaleel and her husband fled Deraa in southern Syria. The couple were both surgeons in Deraa, but cannot practise in the UK until they have passed three exams. “We get benefits, but we want to work. I’ve met five other Syrian families here who are all frustrated because we can’t work,” she says. Back in the kitchen, Muslim and Christian volunteers are working side by side. The cafe receives halal chicken from the Nando’s restaurant chain, dried herbs and spices abandoned at the end of term by Leeds University halls of residence occupants, and groceries, vegetables and other items from supermarkets and food outlets. Only aubergines, tomatoes and lemons had to be purchased for the Khatibs to create their Syrian lunch. Groenewald has been awarded a grant from the Church of England’s Near Neighbours programme to pay for extras and to ensure the cafe has a secure future. “This feels like a good, effective way to love our neighbours,” he says. Harriet Sherwood Giving refugee journalists a voice Temesghen Debesai was a familiar face on Eritrean television. So familiar in fact, that the television news presenter knew he would never be able to flee the east African country without being recognised at the border. Until 2006, when he absconded from a work trip in Bahrain and was granted asylum in Britain, Debesai worked for the government’s public broadcaster, as the head director of the English-language television department, interviewing prominent figures such Kofi Annan and Muammar Gaddafi. Debesai was optimistic at the direction Eritrea was going in until 2001, when the country’s leaders rounded up government ministers who were calling for reform and a number of journalists. Many of this group are still imprisoned and in some cases, their whereabouts – and even whether they are alive – is unknown. “As soon as you see these sorts of things happening you realise nothing is safe,” says Debesai. Debesai, now 40 and living in London, has worked in many fields over the years to get by, but his dream is to get back to journalism and he has found a new source of support in this goal. The Refugee Journalism Project, run by the Migrant Resource Centre and the London College of Communication, is helping him. “Coming here, I knew I’d have to start from scratch,” says Debesai. “One of the biggest problems when you come from another country is networking with people, people on the inside who can tell you who to contact.” Debesai says even simple things such as how to prepare a CV or pitch a story idea differ from country to country. “You need someone to show you the ropes,” he adds. Vivienne Francis, one of the founders of the project, was doing voluntary work with refugees and noticed there were a number of experienced journalists living in the UK as refugees who were finding it difficult to restart their careers. Since starting in May, the people running the project have been contacted by more than 30 refugees from countries including Syria, Eritrea, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Cuba, Bangladesh and the Yemen – many of whom, like Debesai, were prominent journalists at home and now live across the UK. The scheme partners refugee journalists with a local journalist, who acts as their mentor. They are also invited to attend regular workshops on subjects such as UK media law and ethics, and on pitching to editors. Debesai has just secured a paid internship at Thomson Reuters through the project. “If this project had come 10 years ago, imagine where I’d be now,” he says. Another participant in the scheme, Fardous Bahbouh, a refugee from Syria who has lived in the UK for almost six years, works as a translator, teacher, and voiceover artist. She wanted to become a journalist after becoming increasingly frustrated with the way the Syrian conflict and the refugee crisis are portrayed in the media. “So many people pretend to be the experts about Syria, but they are often misinformed,” she says. “When people are talking about our country they should at least listen to Syrians. And then the refugee crisis was more publicised in the west and all these people are talking about refugees but not listening to refugees and I was like, fine I’m going to be the journalist myself.” Bahbouh has just had her first paid article accepted for publication and sees the difference the project is making for other refugees on the course. “It’s very hard to get into the job market – they have the qualifications, they have the skills, but they will regain their self-confidence by being able to contribute,” she says. Kate Lyons The bike fixers Every Thursday night the Bike Project in Denmark Hill, south London donates refurbished bikes to refugees and asylum seekers. One of them is Johannes, a 24-year-old Eritrean, who arrived in the UK earlier this year, alone and with nothing, after a gruelling six-month journey across east Africa and continental Europe. He lives on a support payment of £36 a week, almost half of which is spent on bus fares. He is one of a dozen or so people queuing patiently outside the buzzing workshop, situated on a quiet residential street, to see if he can save more of his money by swapping bus fares for bike rides. It’s also a welcome opportunity to talk to supportive, friendly people. “It will be very helpful for college where I am learning English and for when I have appointments for my asylum application,” says Johannes, who used to cycle in his home country and heard about the project from another asylum seeker. Since launching in 2013, the Bike Project has given away 1,800 bikes. Today it’s very busy. Volunteers and staff mill around, introducing visitors to their bikes and kitting them out with helmets, bike locks, reflective jackets and maps of London. Then they’re taken out for a spin around the neighbourhood to get acquainted with their new wheels and learn about road safety. “We aim to pair some of the 27,500 bikes abandoned in London each year with the 13,500 asylum seekers and refugees who arrive in the city,” says Jem Stein, the initiative’s founder. Discarded bikes are donated by local councils, the police, property developers and housing associations, as well as by members of the public. The project began with Adam, a teenage genocide survivor from Darfur, whom Stein met through a mentoring programme at university. “I gave him my brother’s old bike and it made his life that little bit easier,” says Stein. “Something as simple as having a bike can put people on the road to starting a normal life in a new city. It offers a free and sustainable way to reach important places, for people who could wait years until they’re allowed to earn any money.” Maizer, a Sudanese genocide survivor, says his bike has restored some dignity and independence to his life. “It’s like I have new wings.” On Wednesdays the project runs a women’s cycling group in Poplar, east London, dedicated to giving female refugees and asylum seekers more confidence and independence through cycling. Nadia came to this country from India as an asylum seeker in 2009 and has spent the summer learning how to cycle and making new friends. “It makes you happy, I feel more fresh and energetic after cycling. And it saves travel fares, which are always so difficult if you are on benefits and have to buy groceries as well.” Stein has noticed an increase in demand for bikes and there is now a waiting list of 200 people. To keep up, the Bike Project runs on grants and donations, and is refurbishing and selling its most high-end bikes online. Volunteers are vital, and about half the people who volunteer are refugees or asylum seekers who have benefited from the project and are now using their bikes to come back every week to help out.

2016-12-09T01:49:10Z,"Migrant women isolated and vulnerable to domestic abuse, study finds","Australia’s largest study into family violence against migrant women has found they are already isolated by visa restrictions and language barriers, and vulnerable to being controlled by their abusers. The two-year Aspire project – a joint effort by the University of Melbourne, the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health and the University of Tasmania – took in the experiences of 46 immigrant and refugee women, from more than 20 countries, who had survived family violence. Twenty-six focus groups with 223 men and women were held for the study, and nearly 60 workers from family violence, settlement, and the law and justice sectors were interviewed. Cathy Vaughan, of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Health Equity, who led the study, said many of the women could not work or access social security or health services because of visa restrictions. In many cases, their isolation would be manipulated by their partners, who would forbid them from learning English or how to drive, or choose to live in remote areas. The women also reported extensive financial abuse and coercion over their immigration status. “The process of migration is often associated with isolation because you’re dislocated,” Vaughan told Guardian Australia. ‘That’s compounded when you don’t speak the language of the country that you’re moving to and if you’re completely dependent on someone who sponsored your visa in particular, they’ve got a lot more control in that relationship.” One woman had not been allowed to leave her home for three years, said Vaughan. “She didn’t even know where she lived, let alone who to contact for help,” she said. Another woman arriving in Australia for an arranged marriage was taken to a house in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where the only people she knew were her partner and his family. Within days, she was experiencing severe violence, including being choked. Many of the women were completely dependent on their partner, which made it very difficult for them to leave the relationship, said Vaughan. The cultural backgrounds of abusers varied – some were Anglo-Australians. A bill amending the Migration Act to prevent serious family violence offenders from sponsoring a partner to come to Australia is currently before the Senate. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said it was a “very significant first step in protecting potentially vulnerable visa applicants from the risk of domestic violence”. But Vaughan said, even if the amendment passed, under-reporting of family violence indicated there would still be at-risk women coming to Australia on partner visas. “These men entice women here with false promises and then expect what is essentially domestic servitude,” she said. “Some women end up victims of extreme physical and sexual violence as well – they are essentially brought out here as slaves.” Few women were aware of family violence prevention programs or response services, which were broadly found to be under-resourced and in high demand. Some of those who did seek help reported problems communicating and accessing information, even with the use of interpreters. One woman sought help at a family violence service, telling the interpreter that her husband punched her and made her beg for money. But the interpreter did not translate her words accurately, instead telling her, “You bring shame on our community. I will tell your family you were here.” Many women reported feeling dismissed, disbelieved, blamed and discriminated against by police officers. Adele Murdolo, the executive director of the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health, hoped the findings would prompt community services, and state and federal governments to act decisively to ensure that prevention programs were inclusive and culturally appropriate. Some of the women involved in the study were given cameras to document their work in combating family violence. An exhibition of photographs taken opened in Tasmania on Wednesday and in Melbourne on Friday."
2016-12-20T17:07:31Z,Refugees plead with Germans: don't suspect all of us,"Refugees in Berlin have pleaded with their host nation to avoid placing migrants under a blanket of suspicion after police commandos raided their shelter, which had been home to a man arrested over Monday night’s truck attack on a crowded Christmas market. “We are of course worried,” said Ibrahim Sufi, 26, a Syrian living in hangar 7 at the former Tempelhof airport, an imposing structure built by Adolf Hitler to showcase Nazi might and now being used to house migrants. “We are worried about how the German public will view us after this terrorist attack. My message to the Germans is: ‘Don’t suspect everybody, don’t generalise.’” He tucked his hands into his red jacket to keep warm on the freezing morning. Refugees were accosted by dozens of journalists looking for information about Monday night’s police operation, carried out after the attack that killed 12 people. Some kept their eyes to the ground as they left the huge hangars and sped away to language lessons, waving their arms to fend off reporters. “We woke up to shouts in German around 3.30 in the morning,” said Afghan refugee Safihullah, 21, who lives in hangar 6, which was raided by police. “We had no idea what was happening. Security guards told us to stay in. Later they told us there had been a police raid. They said nothing else.” Ali Muhammed, a Syrian who stayed at Hangar 5, said he had slept at a nearby metro station because there had been too much noise at the shelter overnight. “There are many problems here,” he said, including “fighting over food and drink”. Mohammed Jankhan, 23, from Afghanistan, said he recognised the man police initially identified as the prime suspect when he was shown a photograph by the press. Jankhan said had seen the man at Tempelhof over the last three months, that he spoke Farsi and kept himself to himself. “He was a normal guy”. The influx of more than a million migrants into Germany this year and last, mainly Muslims fleeing countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, has hardened public views on immigration and weakened support for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It has also fuelled xenophobia. Authorities in Berlin say they recorded 59 attacks on refugee shelters in the city last year and 48 so far this year. “We have nothing to do with this crime,” said Ammar Wazzaz, a 45-year-old refugee from the Syrian city of Idlib. “I hope that what this person did won’t tarnish the reputation of refugees like us, who are very grateful to Germany.” Yaser, a 32-year-old refugee from Syria, said he became dejected when he read about the attack on Facebook. “We fled this kind of terrorism and it is following us here,” he said.

2016-12-09T11:30:27Z,US government scrambles to respond to surge of migrants at Mexico border,"In another context you might guess the giant marquees are being set up for a grand wedding. But this is the Texas border with Mexico, and the white tents are rising as the federal government’s latest response to a sharp rise in migrant numbers that is drawing parallels with the influx of 2014. Supply trucks arrived every few minutes as workers set up the Border Patrol holding facility in a field next to the Donna International Bridge, a few hundred metres from a rust-coloured metal border fence. With a capacity of 500, it will hold unaccompanied children and families. In far west Texas, 750 miles away, a similar centre opened near El Paso last month after a dramatic spike of unauthorised crossings in a previously quiet sector. The increase stems perhaps in part from the fear that Donald Trump will build a mighty wall, but is mainly a consequence of continuing violence and economic distress in Central America that migrants say make staying at home a riskier bet than trying to cross into the US and hoping for the best – whatever the president-elect may say or do. “Where I lived there was a lot of violence, a lot of shootings,” said Marta, 21, who had set out from El Salvador with her two children in November. Her one-year-old boy slept in her arms; her four-year-old girl, all energy and excitement, treated the row of seats as a climbing frame. A manilla A4 envelope contained details of their detention, release and court date. Their itinerary for the next two days was scribbled on the back: in 90 minutes they would board a bus to Dallas, then another to Charlotte, then one to Washington, where family members would pick them up. With Trump about to take power, Marta worries that all the effort will be in vain. “He’s going to throw everybody who doesn’t have papers back to their country,” she said. “I’m afraid.” Twenty miles north-west of the Donna bridge, in downtown McAllen, the Sacred Heart Catholic church’s community centre continues to feed, clothe and shelter migrant families released from detention before they leave on public buses to meet up with family or friends elsewhere in the country and await court hearings. The crisis did not stop when the headlines did. According to Border Patrol statistics, 46,195 people were apprehended on the south-west border in October – an increase from recent months and a rise of 41% from the previous October. In total, 408,870 people – including 59,692 lone minors – were stopped in the past fiscal year, compared with 331,333 in 2015 and 479,371 in 2014, when a surge in unaccompanied children and families arriving from central America sparked a political firestorm and placed the immigration system under immense strain. Sister Norma Pimentel, who runs the Sacred Heart shelter, said that it was serving 300-400 people a day around the time of the election, now down to 250-300 – not far off its 2014 peak. “We’re always short of something; we’re constantly getting donations and constantly running out of stuff,” she said. Some 240 miles north, in San Antonio, a similar, if not more chaotic, scene played out at a Mennonite church over the weekend where advocates and volunteers scrambled to take care of hundreds of women and children suddenly released from two Texas centres after a judge’s ruling last Friday threw the federal government’s plans for family detention into question. But in McAllen the talk was of coping with expanding numbers. A pile of plastic bags containing clothes reached almost to the roof. Blue mattresses were stacked near the entrance, ready to be set up in the hall if the three large tents in the parking lot reached capacity. Christmas stockings filled with toys bulged out of a box on a table – parting gifts for the children. In one tent, humid and cramped, more than half of the two-dozen people inside were children, one as yet unborn: Daniela’s due date is 20 December. The 25-year-old from Honduras said through a translator she was “a little bit” worried about making the 1,500 mile journey while heavily pregnant. “Sometimes you have to come through brush,” she said. Daniela said she was fleeing domestic violence and left on 25 November. She arrived eight days later, leaving behind her eight-year-old son, who is with his father. Crossing the Rio Grande was a case of second-time lucky: she was caught in Mexico on 8 November and sent back to Honduras. But a second attempt was included in the $6,000 price charged by the people-smugglers. Despite her looming due date she felt obliged to try again since her US-based mother had provided the money and the family is desperate to be reunited. Daniela said she spent two-and-a-half days in a detention facility where she met several other pregnant women who were “treated the same as everybody else”. She said she had been forced to sleep on a concrete floor with only a foil sheet. “Because it’s the US [I thought] you’d get treated a lot better, but actually it’s not, they treat you better in Mexico,” she said. “In Mexico they give you a blanket.” At least, unlike others, she was not forced to wear a GPS ankle bracelet on release. She has a court date on 19 December. “The conditions suffered by immigrants and refugees at the border have not improved at all since 2014,” said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of Raices, a legal aid non-profit. “They build more, they make them bigger, they don’t make them better.” Several other women at Sacred Heart on Monday complained of cramped, chilly conditions and unsympathetic treatment in the federal facility. The milk for her baby was almost frozen, said Mariela, 21, as her nine-month-old son crawled and munched on an apple. Carmen, 36, said the centre was cold and there was a lack of food, but otherwise it was “more or less OK”. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement announcing the new centre that it will open soon and that the agency will “ensure the basic needs of those in CBP custody are met … add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary” and “regularly assess whether to expand these facilities or keep this temporary facility operational” based on the number of crossings. Daniela planned to join her mother in time for for the birth of her son, who will be an American citizen. Maybe, she joked, she would name him Donald, after the next president: if he ever found out, “that way he might feel a bit more compassionate”."
2016-11-07T07:42:49Z,"Somali migrants are 'disaster' for Minnesota, says Donald Trump","Donald Trump on Sunday warned darkly of the danger posed by Somali migrants in Minneapolis, a deeply segregated city that has the largest Somali-American community in the US. “Here in Minnesota, you’ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval,” the Republican nominee told a rally in the solidly Democratic state, two days before the presidential election. He then claimed: “Some of them [are] joining Isis and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.” “Everybody’s reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota,” he added, before claiming, falsely: “You don’t even have the right to talk about it.” Trump has made warnings about refugees a staple of his stump speech, though he has most commonly targeted Syrians fleeing the five-year civil war that has devastated their country. Three Somali Americans, two US citizens and one a lawful resident, pleaded guilty in June to trying to join the terror group Islamic State, or Isis. Law enforcement officials have said that more than 30 young men from Minnesota have left the county to join Isis or al-Shabaab, which operates in east Africa. According to the 2010 census, more than 85,000 Somali Americans lived in the US with the largest concentration living in the Twin Cities. Despite integration campaigns by the community – a former refugee is poised to win office as a state lawmaker, for instance – the area remains one of the most racially segregated in the US. The Republican nominee has said he would bar refugees from settling in places without the approval of local governments. A federal court ruled against Trump’s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, in October, when he tried to block Syrian refugees from settling in his state. In that decision, judge Richard Posner said Pence’s actions were discriminatory, and “the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating”. In Minneapolis on Sunday, Trump said blocking refugees would be “the least [government] can do for you”. “You’ve suffered enough in Minnesota,” he said, “and we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed and until a proven vetting mechanism has been established.” The US has some of the strictest vetting procedures in the world, requiring multiple stages of interviews with security agencies, background and health checks, and the process can last two years. Trump has not specified which countries he would bar migration from, nor many details of what he calls “extreme vetting”. Trump argued that these methods would prevent terror attacks in the US, citing “the recent terrorist attack in St Cloud”. In that Minnesotan city, in September, a 20-year-old Somali American man stabbed eight people in a mall, before being fatally shot by a police officer. The next day, leaders of the Somali community condemned the attack and the FBI said it was investigating it as a “potential act of terror”. It released few details. “It’s horrible what they’re doing and if you want people to pour in Minnesota all you have to do is vote for Hillary Clinton,” Trump said on Sunday. Somali Americans have become a target for domestic terrorists. In September, three members of a militia group were arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb an apartment building in Garden City, Kansas, with a number of Somali-American residents and where one apartment was used as a mosque. The three men arrested could face life in prison. According to the FBI complaint filed against the suspects, the men called themselves “the Crusaders” and Muslims “cockroaches”, and said that they wanted to “wake people up” with “a bloodbath”. This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to clarify that Garden City, Kansas, was the location of the apartment building that was the target of an alleged bomb plot, not the location of the three members of a militia group arrested over the plot."
2016-11-04T15:05:46Z,"French police move 4,000 people out of Paris migrant camp","French authorities have cleared nearly 4,000 people from Paris’s biggest makeshift migrant camp, insisting those moved would be given shelter, food and support, and helped with asylum applications. In a pre-dawn operation, police sealed off the sprawling ad-hoc shanty town of tents and cardboard shelters that stretches for almost 1,000 metres (3,300ft) from under the arches of the Stalingrad Métro bridge. A fleet of 80 buses took men, women, children and groups of unaccompanied minors out of the area. The operation was organised jointly by the state and Paris city authorities. Officials said families and those considered vulnerable would be housed in and around the capital, while lone male migrants would be taken to reception centres around the country. Humanitarian organisations said people were not being told where they were going and that they feared for those not eligible for asylum in France. However, those who jostled to board buses seemed relieved – even happy – to be going. “It would be good to know where we are being taken, but it will be better than sleeping here,” said one woman, who did not wish to be named. The loudest protests came from French campaigners, who shouted insults at police and City Hall chiefs, but the evacuation passed off without violence. Earlier in the week, fights had broken out as tensions rose. Hundreds of CRS riot police carrying shields and batons had arrived at the ad hoc camp at about 6am. They found the camp’s occupants waiting for them. Word had already gone around that the camp would be broken up in an early-morning operation, and many of those living on the street, among them Afghans, Eritreans, Sudanese and Ethiopians, had packed their few belongings into battered suitcases and plastic bags. Some even folded up their tents and stood waiting, duvets draped around their shoulders to keep out the morning chill. The scene was already bleak; then it began to rain. Locals and humanitarian organisations handed out baguettes and biscuits to women and toddlers, who were given priority on the buses. Marine, 28, an actor living nearby, said she had been visiting the Stalingrad camp for six months. “It wasn’t possible to just sit at home while there was all this misery around me. I felt I had to do something. Many of the migrants were people my own age and we formed a strong bond. Today, I’m afraid for them.” The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, turned up to support the clearance and spoke to a group of Eritrean teenagers, standing out of the rain in a bus shelter waiting to be evacuated. “Do you have houses for us?” one 16-year-old asked in broken English. The mayor reassured them they would be given a roof over their heads. Hidalgo said breaking up the squalid open-air camp was essential. Finding accommodation for the thousands camped at Stalingrad would enable the authorities to start with a clean slate and control the flow of new refugees in the French capital – estimated at 80 a day – in a “humane manner”, she added. A new reception centre will open in the north of Paris next week. “Paris attracts people, but the problem is one that the whole of France needs to deal with. We cannot have camps of this nature in the city. We cannot have people living in such dirty, undignified circumstances,” Hidalgo told the Guardian. “These people need a proper place to sleep. How on earth can refugees or migrants think about their futures if they’ve had no sleep, or been sleeping on the street, and have had nothing to eat. Once they have a roof over their heads, they can reflect on what they will do.” She also praised local residents for their “patience and solidarity”. Alain Guillo, who lives in the 18th arrondissement, said residents and refugees had existed in “deplorable health conditions” in recent months. The number of migrants living rough increased to a record number after the closure of the Calais camp last week. Despite about 30 attempts to move people on and clear the area in the last 18 months, they have always returned. “In the end, it grew so large that it was no longer a refugee camp in a district, it was a district inside a refugee camp. What we wanted was dignity for all: residents and refugees,” Guillo said."
2016-11-03T17:47:20Z,"After her arrest, the ‘Afghan Girl’ is once again a symbol of refugees’ plight | Steve McCurry","I first encountered Sharbat Gula in 1984, in Pakistan, when she was an orphan living in a refugee camp just outside of Peshawar with her grandmother and siblings. One of the photographs I took of her became known around the world as Afghan Girl. She became the face of refugees for many years. Today, more than three decades later and despite having one of the most famous faces on the planet, Sharbat Gula is still a displaced person – one who is now facing up to 14 years in prison for the same reasons that brought her to a refugee camp all those years ago. With her arrest last week for living illegally in Pakistan and her current imprisonment, she is now being made into a symbol of unwanted migrants around the world. Gula is one of the estimated 3 million Afghan refugees who currently reside in Pakistan. A widow and an orphan, she has lived in the country virtually all her adult life. She has endeavoured to raise her four children alone. She represents all the brave women and men who will endure any pain and hardship to protect the most precious thing they have – their children. Last week authorities from Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency raided her apartment and arrested her for allegedly having false identity documents. She could face deportation, prison and fines of up to $5,000. Her bail has been denied. I find Gula’s treatment by the authorities impossible to understand. They seem to want to humiliate her, and appear to have gone out of their way to treat her with disrespect. Hundreds of thousands of other Afghan refugees face the same situation. The United Nations Refugee Agency has estimated there are 1 million unregistered Afghans living in Pakistan. Gula’s situation is not unique, and in the media circus of the past week it seems she has already been tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion. The strength of the picture I took, its success, has to do with Sharbat Gula and her expression: her eyes and their gaze, that fierce look of dignity and determination. It’s an honour to be the photographer who took that iconic picture. It has stood the test of time, which is a testament to the picture, but mostly to Gula herself. Seventeen years later, I went looking for her and was reunited with her, and it was extraordinary. I was thrilled that she was still alive. Gula didn’t know that her picture had been published all over the world, but in time she understood. She did remember that I took her picture that day because it was the first time in her life that she had been photographed. The second time was when I was reunited with her. That fact reminds me of what one of her relatives told CBS News this week, that she is a “simple, illiterate lady” who may not understand legal documents. For over a decade, she didn’t realise that millions of people knew her face. Gula’s relative said that she was set to return to her father’s village in Afghanistan this summer, but had been delayed because of the supposed presence of Islamic State elements nearby. The raid on her home last week was, I believe, politically motivated. Many believe she was targeted. As her face once symbolised the hopes of countless refugees, the image of her post-arrest mugshot circulated last week was meant to instil fear into other refugees – and to turn the minds of others against the migrant population. When I first saw that arrest shot, I was saddened by the apparent attempt to humiliate and debase her; but at the same time, I saw that same gaze I first glimpsed decades ago in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp, when an orphan girl stared back at my lens with a proud, haunted look. Sharbat Gula’s face, now older, is once again a symbol of the refugee’s plight."
2016-10-04T12:45:51Z,'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum,"More than 98% of Hungarians who took to the polls in Sunday’s referendum voted to close the door to refugees. However more than half of the electorate didn’t vote rendering the process constitutionally null and void. We asked our readers what they thought of the result and why more people didn’t vote. Here’s what some of you said. ‘Orbán poses a greater danger than people may realise’ I didn’t vote because not voting helped to nullify the result. Thus I am very happy things turned out the way they did. Orbán poses a greater danger than people may realise. He sows strife and conflict within the EU where he wants to divide and rule in his bid for ever greater power. Orbán is not just a disaster in Hungary, but a very real and dangerous presence in the EU. I cannot understand why the EU continues to just sit on its hands, while one of its member countries flouts almost all the regulations and rules of its membership. The EU was founded not just on a free and open market economy, but its other raison d’etre was the dissemination and development of democratic norms and principles. Orbán has used these democratic systems to to undermine democracy itself and as he proudly proclaims, to create an illiberal country where he has become an oligarch. Anonymous, 67-year-old from Budapest ‘I don’t agree with this demagogy’ I did not participate in this referendum by voting yes or no. I voted invalidly by marking all the possible options in order to spoil my vote. I did this because I wanted to show that I don’t agree with this demagogy. I don’t think the quota is the right solution to handle the refugee crisis because I think a strong checkpoint is needed at the borders. But this referendum was not really about asking a question - it was about power. It was a survey of whether the Hungarian government would have enough voters in 2018 or not. I am not surprised by the result though I thought the referendum would be valid. I think people decided not to vote because they are fed up with the old world - the authoritarian governments of the past of Hungary. On the other hand, maybe people just did not care about the question. Attila Benke, 30-year-old living in Tura ‘I’m very disappointed by the result’ I voted no because I believe in a democratic society. Every person has the right to privacy and to be able to live with who they wish. I do not believe countries outside Europe should be able to force themselves into a country or countries where they do not belong. I am not a racist and I believe the world should look after genuine refugees but not economic migrants. I’m very disappointed by the result. The referendum was not meant to be political, but a way of legally finding out how the people in Hungary feel about the migration situation. I think people refused to vote as a way of trying to get Obán Viktor out of office. Máté Pál, 72-year-old living in the north west of Hungary ‘More people should have spoiled their ballots’ I voted by spoiling my ballot. I remember last year when a large crowd of people marched on the street near where I live. They wanted to go to western Europe and when the government banned them from going by train they just set off on foot. I had mixed feelings about them. They were determined, but I also felt like they were being arrogant in the way they left trash all over the road and seemed like they absolutely didn’t care about the citizens of Hungary. Despite all of this I wouldn’t mind if a few people, in moderate numbers, were to resettle in Hungary. I chose to vote in the referendum but I put a cross in both circles, because I think Orbán’s time is up. It seems like power has overcome him and, if allowed, would continue to dismantle democracy and the constitutional state if re-elected. So, in my opinion, this referendum wasn’t really about the EU quota but more about the political mood of the country. I would be a lot happier if more people had spoiled their ballots. This would have been an obvious message - that the referendum question was improper. I think very few people voted because they thought the question was stupid, and believed there to be no correct answer. However, in Hungary this kind of turnout is pretty average.

2016-09-14T11:07:25Z,"UK not doing enough for refugees, say charities and aid agencies","A group of 50 leading refugee charities and aid agencies has condemned the government’s record on the refugee crisis, describing the support offered by the UK as “not enough – not even close”. In a letter to the prime minister before two crucial international refugee summits, which Theresa May is due to attend, the charities state that the global response so far has been inadequate. “Of course, the commitment by David Cameron to resettle 23,000 refugees by 2020 is a welcome step in the right direction. But it is not enough – not even close – as hundreds of thousands of refugees remain in desperate need,” the letter, signed by Oxfam, the Children’s Society and Christian Aid, among others, states. The charities call on the UK government to adopt three commitments during next week’s talks in the US, requesting that the UK should take a leading role in “developing a humane, coordinated international response to the millions fleeing crisis”, offer safe passage to more refugees, in part by removing obstacles to family reunification, and commit to providing better support for those refugees who reach the UK so they can rebuild their lives here. May is due to to attend the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants next Monday and the US Leaders’ Summit on Refugees on Tuesday. The letter is designed to showcase the strength and unanimity of feeling among relevant organisations before a refugee solidarity march scheduled to take place in central London on Saturday. Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International, one of the letter’s signatories, said: “History will judge us for our failure to deal with the global refugee crisis. Instead of focusing on putting up more barriers to keep people out, the UK must urgently provide the safe and legal routes refugees fleeing violence and persecution desperately need.” The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Maurice Wren, said: “The prime minister has the chance to lead by example – by offering more refugees safe passage and encouraging other countries to do the same. The time for prevarication and evasion is over; world leaders must make sharing responsibility for protecting refugees their number one priority.” World leaders attending Monday’s refugee summit will consider how best to respond to “an unprecedented level of human mobility”, with an estimated 65 million people forcibly displaced in 2015, including 21 million refugees. They will discuss signing up to a draft declaration that acknowledges that refugees are facing a “desperate ordeal” and pledges that the international community’s challenge is “above all moral and humanitarian”. “We are determined to save lives” and “combat with all the means at our disposal the abuses and exploitation suffered by countless refugees and migrants in vulnerable situations”, the draft document states. The letter to the prime minister reminds her that a year ago 100,000 people marched through London to register their dismay at the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned as his family fled to safety, “sending a clear message that this country must not stand by while children drown in Europe’s seas”. The continuation of the crisis, a year later, reflects “the inadequacy of the international community’s response until now, and its failure to address the root causes”, the letter states, adding that unless constructive action is taken by the government “we too will be party to that failure”. A government spokesperson defended the government’s record, stating: “This government has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. We have pledged £2.3bn in humanitarian aid to Syria and neighbouring countries and providing nearly £70m in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis.”"
2016-12-13T17:31:03Z,Pensioner presents every MP with collection of refugee stories,"An October excursion to a local bookshop by a pensioner and human rights activist has this week ended in MPs receiving a Christmas gift she hopes will challenge the rhetoric surrounding refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. At the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, Michaela Fyson from Staffordshire handed over copies – one for each MP – of A Country of Refuge, with help from the book’s editor, Lucy Popescu. The event was attended by MPs, members of the Lords, writers and refugees. A mixture of specially commissioned fiction, memoir, poetry and essays, A Country of Refuge was created “to make a positive and vital contribution to the national debate and to foster a kinder attitude towards our fellow humans who are fleeing violence, persecution, poverty or intolerance,” Popescu said. Fyson said she was inspired to give the gifts to MPs after buying a copy of the book in her local bookshop. She said: “The idea of influencing the tone of the debate around refugees and asylum seekers came to me when I read the introduction. I thought, I need to act on this. “There are too many politicians referring to these groups of people as if they are animals – talking about them ‘swarming’, or needing their teeth checked like horses to see how old they are. That is what we need to change.” Sebastian Barry, one of the contributors to the anthology, whose Fragment of a Journal, Author Unknown investigates an earlier migration by people fleeing the Irish Famine, who crossed the Atlantic in “coffin ships”, said:“If we don’t honour the redemptive fact that all modern humans belong to the same family, and that therefore the children who have been abandoned in France are our children and our urgent responsibility, then there is no justice, and no human history to be proud of.” Mirroring the book’s route to market, Fyson crowdfunded buying the 650 copies needed. “I had to get the money together in a great rush,” the 71-year-old said. “I did it through a network of people: friends and friends of friends. Some gave a few pennies others several hundreds of pounds. Everyone was incredibly generous.” Fyson has spent her life campaigning for refugee causes after a Hungarian refugee came to live with her family in 1956. She said that MPs would be contacted after Christmas to make sure they have read the book. Help with her task has come from unexpected sources. “When the books were delivered they arrived in a great pantechnicon in the middle of my village,” she explained. “The driver said he had to leave the pallet with all the books on it on the pavement, but when I told him what they were for, he helped get them inside. People have been so generous and supportive.” Popescu was inspired to curate the collection two years ago after hearing the rhetoric being used to demonise refugees and asylum seekers in the media and by politicians. Her aim was to encourage compassion and empathy, she said Though writers asked to contribute to the collection had been supportive, publishers were less enthusiastic, Popescu said. “This was before the Syrian refugee crisis, and none of the big publishers would touch it,” she added. “My agent went to every major publisher in town and everyone said that a short-story collection about refugees wouldn’t sell.” Crowdfunding publishing house Unbound picked up the title. A second volume, focused on the experiences of refugee children, is planned for next year, Popescu added. “We want to get it onto the school curriculum and into school libraries. I am doing a call out now to children’s authors to get them involved.”"
2016-11-24T21:16:40Z,Refugees in US nervously await Trump presidency after campaign rhetoric,"Refugees settled in the US are in a terrible limbo and fearful of being deported while they wait to see how they will be treated by Donald Trump’s new administration, advocacy groups and experts say. They told the Guardian that the attacks on refugees during the election campaign had already had a chilling effect and that since Trump’s election win, refugee families had been in contact asking for advice about whether they faced being deported. One expert said the president could virtually stop new refugees coming to the country amid the continuing Syrian crisis. Anxieties were heightened on Monday when Kris Kobach, currently secretary of state for Kansas but rumored to be on the shortlist for a cabinet post, possibly as leader of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was photographed going into a meeting with Trump with documents that outlined aggressive proposals to bar the entry of Syrian refugees and reinstate a national registry focused on Muslims. Although Trump’s team has denied that the president-elect supports a Muslim registry, as a candidate he repeatedly expressed his openness to the idea on the campaign trail. He emphasized the need for a database of Syrian refugees, but refused on multiple occasions to rule out a Muslim registry when presented with the question. On one occasion, he claimed that resettled Syrians might rob their neighbors. Reports of hate crimes have spiked since the election and newly released FBI data shows that hate crimes against American Muslims rose sharply last year. “We have all been shocked at the level of vitriol used by some people who are running for office regarding refugees,” said Lee Williams, vice-president of the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI). The US is the global leader in refugee resettlement and historically, the program, backed by the USCRI, has received bipartisan support and is an element of US foreign policy. But after the Paris terror attacks last year, Republicans, led most forcefully by Trump, began to withdraw support for it. A number of Republican governors refused to work with the federal government to resettle Syrians in their states, citing unfounded terror concerns. And Trump’s routine on the campaign trail included criticizing refugees and migrants and promising to “shut down” entry to Muslims. At an April rally in Rhode Island, Trump mentioned that Syrian refugees had been recently resettled in the state. The crowd began to boo. Trump continued, suggesting without any evidence that Syrians could break into residents’ homes. “Lock your doors, folks,” he warned. Williams said the scapegoating of refugees, especially ones from Syria, had sent tremors through the community. He said in the past week the organization had received calls from families already resettled in the US wondering whether they would be deported. Similarly, refugees currently moving through the lengthy screening process to come to the US are fearful the new administration will stop taking refugees altogether, throwing them back into limbo. “These are people who by definition have been forced to flee because of violence, their ethnicity, their religion or who they love,” Williams said. “The last thing we want to do is have people who are traumatized to end up being resettled in a community where they may face violence as a result of their ethnicity or background.” A closer look at the papers revealed by Kobach showed a “strategic plan” for the DHS in the first 365 days of a Trump administration. At the top of Kobach’s list of recommendations was to “bar the entry of potential terrorists” and to both update and reimplement a program instituted by the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks that tracked individuals from “high-risk areas” of the world. Known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), the program was based on the country from which an individual migrated but was widely regarded by the media at the time as a Muslim registry. Kobach, who served in the justice department under Bush, was a chief architect of NSEERS. The world is in the midst of the largest refugee crisis since the second world war. An estimated 4.8 million Syrians alone have fled the country since the civil war started in March 2011, mostly to neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. In his last year in office, Obama raised the number of worldwide refugees the US accepts from 85,000 this year to 110,000 over the next fiscal year. The US has accepted nearly 14,000 Syrian refugees since last October and surpassed its goal of accepting 10,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, according to data from the state department’s Refugee Processing Center. Trump’s election also casts doubt on the future of a series of groundbreaking refugee-related pledges made at an Obama-led summit on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in September. The Obama administration persuaded more than 30 countries to roughly double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children, and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults. “Put simply, this could be a total, historic disaster for refugee resettlement to the US,” said Clara Long, a researcher with the US program at Human Rights Watch. She is worried that if the US were to stop accepting refugees, countries in Europe might follow suit, especially the ones where politicians there have whipped up similar xenophobic fears. With Trump’s history of shifting on position, advocates say they are hopeful cooler heads in Congress and his cabinet will keep him from implementing his proposals on refugees. During his campaign, Trump proposed a “Muslim ban”. In a statement from December 2015, the businessman called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” and claimed that there is “great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population”. Since then, the proposal has gone through numerous iterations but the text of the original statement remains on his website. At present, Trump’s team has said it plans to “suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur”. It’s unclear how they define “terror-prone”, but it would almost certainly describe Syrians, who, combined with Afghans and Somalis, account for half of the world’s refugees. Following Trump’s election, the state department said that it could not comment on the effect that his administration would have on Obama’s initiative. But at the time of the summit, assistant secretary of state Anne Richard admitted that the enactment of the pledges would in part depend on the priorities of the next administration. Perhaps not by coincidence, Obama met last week with six-year-old Alex, who wrote to the president offering his home to a Syrian refugee child after an image of the child sitting bloodied and dazed in an ambulance sparked shock and outrage. “You being so nice, and kind, hopefully makes other people think the same way,” Obama told the boy. The president has broad authority over the resettlement of refugees, said Susan Fratzke, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute who has worked in the state department’s bureau of population, refugees, and migration. In this respect, she said, Trump could virtually stop refugees from coming to the US after he takes office. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that the US “doesn’t know anything” about the refugees it admits. However, Fratzke explained the US has one of the most extensive screening systems of any country in the world. The process typically takes between 18 months and two years and includes multiple security checks across several agencies. Legal experts and advocates will be watching closely to see how Trump proceeds. A ban on Muslim refugees, for example, might violate the constitutional right to freedom of religion, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University. “A lot will depend on his discretion,” Yale-Loehr said. “President-elect Trump stated in his victory speech that he will be fair to everyone. Let’s hope he keeps that promise to immigrants.” In the meantime, advocates are urging the 45th president of the United States to honor the country’s longstanding, bipartisan tradition of accepting refugees. “For decades, the United States has been at the forefront of resettling those fleeing violence, offering safe haven to hundreds of thousands of refugees in the aftermath of both world war II and the Vietnam war with significant bipartisan support,” the International Refugee Assistance Project said in a statement released after Trump’s electoral victory. “In line with this tradition and America’s most fundamental values, we urge the president-elect to keep our doors open to those in danger.”"
2016-05-18T15:07:54Z,Only 177 Syrian refugees resettled in EU under deal with Turkey,"Fewer than 200 Syrians have been resettled in Europe under the EU’s controversial refugee deal with Turkey, figures from the European commission have revealed. EU leaders agreed in March to take one Syrian from Turkey for every irregular migrant sent back across the Aegean Sea. Since the deal came into force, the number of people arriving in Greece has fallen sharply, but Europe has taken only a tiny number of Syrians from Turkey. A total of 177 Syrians who were in Turkey have been found homes in five EU member states, the figures showed. Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands have taken the most people, 52-55 each, while Finland and Lithuania have taken a smaller number (11 and five respectively). A further 723 Syrians are awaiting transfer to seven different member states, the commission said. Turkey was also promised €3bn (£2.3bn) of refugee aid until 2018 as well as visa-free access to the EU, subject to conditions. But the deal is at risk of unravelling as Turkey refuses to change its anti-terror laws to meet a key EU demand on visa-free travel. Another potential pitfall is the mismatch in expectations between Turkey and the EU over how many Syrians will be resettled in Europe. EU countries have said they expect to see 12,000 refugees relocated from Turkey, well below the 72,000 places that are available under EU law, and far below the expectations of Turkey, which is sheltering more than 3.1 million refugees in total. Turkish officials expect Europe to airlift substantial numbers of the 2.7 million Syrians now stuck in Turkey, a senior Turkish diplomat said on Wednesday. “With irregular migration declining, we should activate the voluntary humanitarian resettlement also,” said Esen Altuğ, deputy director general for migration at Turkey’s ministry of foreign affairs. The number of migrants being sent back to Turkey from Greece has also fallen short of EU expectations: fewer than 400 people have been returned so far. The EU-Turkey deal is part of a broader push to bring Syrian refugees in the Middle East to Europe, to take the pressure off states including Lebanon and Jordan, where large numbers have taken refuge. The latest figures showed that 6,321 people out of a proposed 20,000 from refugee camps in the region have been resettled in Europe. The UK has taken the largest number of people (1,864), followed by Austria (1,443). The British government promised to take 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years, a goal criticised as derisory in comparison to the scale of the problem. The latest tranche of data also revealed that efforts to relocate asylum seekers from Italy and Greece remain well off target. In September 2015, the EU promised to disperse 160,000 asylum seekers around the bloc to take the pressure off frontline Mediterranean states. EU officials hoped the first 20,000 people would be rehoused by mid-May, but Wednesday’s data reveals that only 1,500 people have been relocated. Meanwhile, about 46,000 asylum seekers and migrants are in limbo in Greece, awaiting news of either asylum applications or relocation decisions. With the EU failing to relocate significant numbers of refugees from Greece, and the Greek authorities struggling to care for those stuck in their detention centres, dozens of asylum seekers in Greece have begun a hunger strike in protest at their treatment. On the island of Chios, where more than a thousand asylum seekers have been detained in squalid conditions since the start of the EU-Turkey deal, 40 people – 25 women and 15 men – have said they will not eat until further notice. “We left our country to find a better life and education for our children, not just to live in a camp without doing anything,” said Wassim Omar, a Syrian father on hunger strike in Chios, who spoke via WhatsApp because his mouth was taped shut. “We escaped from Daesh [Islamic state] and Jabhat al-Nusra [al-Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate], who had threatened to kill us because my wife and I are teachers, and from the Syrian regime’s army, who wanted me to do military service. We don’t want to spend our life here, so because of that we have this hunger strike.” The European commissioner for migration and home affairs, Dimitris Avramopoulos, once again urged member states to do more. “We need to quickly respond to the urgent humanitarian situation in Greece and prevent deterioration of the situation in Italy. “In parallel, we need to increase resettlements, mostly from Turkey, but also from other countries, such as Lebanon and Jordan. Our recent progress in breaking the smugglers’ business model is only sustainable if a safe legal channel also opens for asylum seekers.” Since the EU-Turkey deal came into force on 20 March, the number of migrants attempting the dangerous sea crossing over the Aegean has fallen sharply: arrivals were down by 90% in April, compared with the previous month. But EU officials are concerned about a likely increase in arrivals from Italy, as the weather improves. About 8,370 people crossed the western Mediterranean sea in April, mostly Eritreans, Egyptians and Nigerians. The decline in Aegean crossings means that Italy has experienced more migrant arrivals than Greece for the first time since June 2015. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Liberal group in the European parliament, said the relocation and resettlement figures were disappointing. The MEP added: “Whether the rotten EU-Turkey agreement is maintained or not, we know the numbers of refugees and migrants risking their lives to come to Europe is likely to increase dramatically in the coming months. “Instead of constantly trying to outsource our problems to questionable regimes in Turkey and Africa, it’s vital the EU gets its own house in order by stepping up its humanitarian response and working together to deliver a genuine European migration and asylum policy, with a permanent border and coastguard capacity.”"
2016-12-30T15:00:01Z,Teddies and teargas canisters: what remained in the Calais camp,"A moment of professional crisis and self-loathing inspired Gideon Mendel’s photographs of abandoned objects in the now-demolished Calais refugee camp. He had travelled to the site to participate in a thoughtful-sounding project, where refugees were loaned cameras to allow them to document their own experiences. But it wasn’t going tremendously well; the refugees had more pressing concerns on their hands than documenting their own lives, such as finding food and somewhere to sleep. Mendel was disturbed by the level of hostility that cameras provoked. “There were so many cameras coming in; there were no gatekeepers, because it wasn’t an official camp, so any photography student, tourist or sympathiser could wander in. The general feeling was that the camera was an enemy of some sort.” He was also bewildered by the array of misguided benevolent ventures converging on the camp: “Calais felt at times like a music festival gone wrong.” During one visit in early May, he watched as a Spanish circus came waltzing through the tents and huts with jugglers and musicians, followed by a Christian procession with a healing donkey and, later, a delegation of sympathisers from Essex – all taking pictures. “They were making a donation, and they had to be photographed handing over the cash,” he says. “There were all kinds of weird and wonderful and terrible things that came into the camp. I thought, ‘What people really need is immigration lawyers.’” He followed the procession into a church built by Eritrean refugees from sticks and tarpaulin, and had just begun to take some pictures when he was confronted by a refugee who started shouting at him: “You fucking photographers. You come here and you take our photographs and you tell us that it’s going to help us, but nothing changes. The only person that it helps is you.” It was an acutely worded attack, and Mendel became “quite revolted with the idea of photographing in the camp. I didn’t want to lift a camera any more.” He was already uneasy with the photographic tropes that have emerged from the crisis: the lines of waiting, needy people; the emotional faces of people trying to cross borders; the queues of people stepping off boats; the images of people sitting around campfires; the shacks. “The most infamous image of queueing migrants is the one Ukip used so brilliantly, playing on the sense that they are queueing to come and take stuff that is ours. Even if the intention of the photographer is compassionate and sympathetic, the usage can be problematic and add to the stigma and the fear.” But Mendel was reluctant to retreat from the subject. His work has always focused on challenging subjects; his last major project was Drowning World, a series of portraits of people in homes submerged by flood waters, highlighting the effects of climate change. The migrant story had a personal resonance. His parents were refugees from Nazi Germany; his father’s mother died in the Holocaust. He felt moved by the difficulties faced by the thousands of people stuck in Calais. So Mendel turned his gaze to the detritus left behind. His photographs of abandoned toothbrushes and soft toys encrusted with mud and sand give a powerful alternative portrait of the human misery of the camp. Eighteen months of the refugee crisis have made many in Britain hardened and desensitised to the issue. The Guardian’s own online news consumption analysis shows that articles about refugees are often clicked on in small numbers. Readers have been cauterised to the pain of the unfolding human disasters and are often jaundiced in their approach to individual stories. The shock factor of distressing images has waned through repeated exposure – all of which makes Mendel’s sideways view more arresting, harder to skip over. His pictures of flattened footballs, singed clothes, ripped sleeping bags and recycled teargas canisters force you to think about the experiences of the people who lived in the camp. A picture of muddy children’s gloves reminds you of the utter squalor that infected the whole site. He has lined up worn-down shoes with the forensic precision of a medical photographer. “The shoes speak of distress. Some shoes are burnt; fire was a recurring thing in the camp, first because there was no electricity, just candles, so a lot of things were burned accidentally, and later people were torching things before the demolition.” Anxious to avoid the pictures becoming “ruin porn”, another photographic cliche (used particularly in relation to the beautiful images of post-industrial Detroit), Mendel was careful to display the objects in as dignified a way as possible. “There was such chaos in the place, I had this instinct to make things as organised and neat as I could.” He made several trips to dig around in the sandy wasteland, sifting through layers of rubbish, asking himself, “How would someone in 1,000 years understand what had happened here?” This activity was viewed with bemusement by the camp’s inhabitants, but without the antagonism that photography provoked. His last trip was made as the camp was demolished by French police, and the inhabitants were bussed to nearby hostels, where many remain, applying for formal asylum in France. Others have returned to sleep rough in smaller settlements along the coast, still trying to make their way to join relatives in the UK. Just before the site was sealed by police, Mendel carted away black bin bags full of rubbish: burnt children’s books (including The Tiger Who Came To Tea by Judith Kerr, herself a refugee), scraps of bedding, used tampons (a reminder, he says, of the particular difficulty of being a woman in a camp of 10,000 people with just a handful of Portaloos). To the “non-delight” of his family, he still has a collection of bits in the basement. His project has provoked scepticism from his teenage son, who said, “Dad, most people bring things to refugee camps. You go in and take things away.” Mendel hopes that the pictures will “touch people on a deep emotional level. I want to do work that makes an impact, that touches people’s consciousness. I wish I could offer a clear response and say, You can do this to help the situation; but I’m afraid that isn’t there for me. The work is my response to this world, where you have places of relative safety and places of danger; places of wealth and places of poverty.” • This year’s Guardian appeal is in aid of child refugees; to donate, go to theguardian.com/charity-appeal-2016 An exhibition of these pictures, Gideon Mendel: Dzhangal, runs at Autograph ABP Gallery, London EC2 from 6 January-11 February (admission free).

2016-11-27T12:00:00Z,Hundreds of churches offer sanctuary to undocumented migrants after election,"Hundreds of churches in the US have said they are willing to provide sanctuary for undocumented migrants threatened with deportation following the election of Donald Trump as president. About 300 churches nationally have come forward in the past two weeks, according to the Philadelphia-based New Sanctuary Movement. It has also seen the number of people in the city registering as volunteers for its “sanctuary in the streets” programme rise from 65 to more than 1,000 since the election. The Church World Service estimates 400 churches nationwide are willing to open their doors to people at risk of deportation. A growing number of synagogues are also involved in actions to prevent deportations. Meanwhile, about two dozen cities – including New York, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia and Los Angeles – have declared themselves “sanctuary cities”, with mayors pledging to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration orders that could lead to deportations. Trump has said he will block federal funding to such cities. During his election campaign, Trump said he would deport an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants from the United States. Since becoming president-elect, he has said he plans to immediately deport or incarcerate 2 to 3 million undocumented migrants who have been convicted of crimes. “What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could even be 3 million, we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate. But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally,” Trump told 60 Minutes a few days after the election. According to Peter Pedemonti of the New Sanctuary Movement, “people are very scared. There are waves of despair, anger and disbelief at Trump’s election and the rise of white supremacism. This is a very shocking part of US society that was in the shadows before, and with Trump it has come into the mainstream. It’s very disturbing.” He said he had seen a “pretty dramatic swell in congregations coming forward and asking questions about how to get involved. We’ve had a wave of people contacting us about sanctuary.” Pedemonti added: “The faith community has a specific role to stand up and speak out, and offering sanctuary is a bold way of doing that.” Javier Flores, an undocumented Mexican who has been deported several times, took sanctuary in the United Methodist Church in Arch Street, Philadelphia, five days after Trump’s election although his current deportation process started before the 8 November poll. “The church is providing space and support for as long as Javier wants to be here,” said the Rev Robin Hynicka. The father of three’s “first and foremost desire is to stay with his family”. Anxiety over immigration issues before the election had been exacerbated, said Hynicka. “People are feeling more vulnerable than before. [But] people of faith and conscience are walking alongside the immigrant community. Sanctuary provides a moral alternative to what we think is an immoral policy.” Flores was not in hiding, Hynicka added. “Immigration knows where he is – he has a monitoring bracelet on his ankle. He’s not hiding, he’s resisting.” The concept of sanctuary can be traced back to the Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible. Today, places of worship are considered to be “sensitive locations” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). “Enforcement actions at or focused on sensitive locations such as schools, places of worship, and hospitals should generally be avoided,” say guidelines. Since the election, several Anglican bishops have offered sanctuary. The Right Rev Kirk Smith, the bishop of Arizona, said the church would “promote a safe space for those who are feeling vulnerable and afraid, and for good reason”. The bishops of Virginia told Latino congregants: “We stand with you not only symbolically, but will be there to stand with you literally if and when the time comes.” The diocese of Oregon pledged that its churches would be “sanctuaries for those whose safety and security is threatened”. Alison Harrington, pastor of the Southside Presbyterian church in Tucson, Arizona, said the number of churches joining the sanctuary movement was “growing every day as people are horrified at what lies ahead, knowing that Trump has said he’s going after immigrants”. Harrison has sheltered two undocumented Mexicans in her church over the past two years. “By and large, the authorities respect sanctuary. We’re hoping that the tradition of honouring sacred space will continue in the future. But we don’t need the Department of Homeland Security to tell us that a church is a sacred space – that is a fundamental truth and one we will defend.” In Los Angeles, a multi-faith gathering at the city’s Islamic Centre next week will consider possible forms of resistance to agencies seeking to deport undocumented migrants. “We’re coming together to try to figure out the best way to push back, focusing on sacred resistance and sanctuary,” said Rabbi Jonathan Klein. As well as providing refuge for individuals, places of worship which offer sanctuary draw attention to broader issues, said Pedemonti. It was important to remember that “although there has been a huge increase in fear [among migrants] after Trump’s election, with the expectation of more draconian enforcement, the Obama administration deported 2.5 million undocumented migrants – so the immigrant community has lived with fear for years.” Pedemonti said he could not “wrap my head around” the fact that 81% of white Christian evangelicals backed Trump in the election. “I don’t understand how a Christian can vote for a person whose policies so blatantly contradict the Bible’s teaching to love your neighbour.”"
2016-12-06T15:38:21Z,Labour has never had an open-door immigration policy | Diane Abbott,"One of the great myths of public life in the UK is that we are not allowed to talk about immigration, yet an objective observer might feel we talk about little else. At the heart of the debate, there has been a pervasive “post-truth” narrative that Labour governments operated an open-door immigration policy – one that they maintain in opposition today. But no British government has ever had an open-door immigration policy, Labour, Conservative or otherwise. Historically, the main driving force for immigration to this country has been government policy powered by an economic necessity within the UK. We need migrant workers. There have of course been frequent periods of war and upheaval which have produced large numbers of refugees – the Syria crisis is just the latest example of this. A widely known example is the “Windrush generation” of migrants arriving from the Caribbean, starting with the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948. These migrants were invited to come here. The postwar labour shortage, the tasks of reconstruction and the continuation of conscription all meant that migrants were making a vital contribution to the economy, both the private and public sectors – without even mentioning the ways in which they enriched the cultural life of the country. This was true of Irish immigration from the mid-19th century onwards and many less well known influxes of labour, including overseas workers to the south Wales coal fields towards the turn of 20th century. About the same time, Russians and Poles also settled in Scotland, taking up work in the mines and in the tailoring and catering trades. The Jewish population of Scotland grew dramatically, partly as a result – though it still stands at around 0.1% of the population. All of these enriched the whole of society, materially and culturally. Yet over time immigration rules have only become tighter. For all those Commonwealth citizens who were initially told they were entitled to come here but have since been blocked, or for those separated from loved ones by arcane rules separating families, the notion that Britain has an open-door immigration policy will produce hollow laughter. In the 14 years before 2010 there were 91 policy or legislative changes on some aspect of immigration. Virtually all of them tightened immigration access. The coalition and the current Tory government were not to be outdone. In a little over six years, there have been a further 209 such changes. This legislative frenzy has always been cast in terms of controlling numbers or, even more fruitlessly, in the case of Theresa May, reducing numbers. Immigration is growing in the UK, just as it is in France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and a host of European and other countries, because migrants are needed and because people want to migrate. At times we have introduced controls that undermine our own prosperity. Recently, universities, farmers and the NHS have all reported difficulties in recruiting from Europe. As business, government, markets and labour forces become more international these trends will only continue. Without immigration in some parts of the country we would face a serious crisis: we have a rapidly ageing population, yet would be unable to staff public services, attract financial expertise, or even process potatoes. Labour does not have an open-door immigration policy, it never has. Labour is for fair migration policies that benefit the population as a whole, plus a policy of investment that will improve the living standards for the overwhelming majority of people."
2016-12-12T00:53:51Z,We can fight hate and racism by telling the stories of migrants | Dan Cass,"This was the year when racism seemed to suddenly grow into a powerful political project, in Europe and America. When Donald Trump was elected he was cheered on by the KKK and neo-Nazis. Sadly, some conservative Australian politicians act as the shock troops for race hate. Rather than building understanding, their strategy is division; they bang on about how Australia used to be a great place to be a racist. (The attorney general, George Brandis, used the term “bigot” but we know what he meant.) Literature and the law are two very different responses to hate speech and my late sister embodied both. Deborah Cass was a legal academic at the London School of Economics. She loved working in the law and published important scholarship. She believed in the better side of our shared humanity, and the possibility of making a better world. She fought for the underdog and defeated bullies. If the law was the great love of Deborah’s hard working intellect, it was literature that was her first love. As a teenager she read and reread the Greek myths. After falling ill she retired from the law and took up writing fiction. She had some short writing published and started on a novel. As a young girl Deborah was shy, so our parents made her a little theatre, to help build her confidence. Dad constructed a wooden stage and Mum sewed on a curtain and fashioned a family of glove puppets. Deborah would act out little plays, literally trying on different characters. She found a strong voice for herself, by imagining other people. Empathy made her strong. Deborah died in 2013 at 53 years of age after a long and courageous struggle with cancer. She lived life with vigour but we knew there was much left undone and wanted to remember her with a prize in her name. We thought hard about what it should be. How do you pay tribute to a life? We chose in the end to go with her heart not her head, and decided to create a prize for writers not lawyers. Deborah’s family and friends resolved that her prize should explore the migrant experience, as this would reflect her life and her values. She was the granddaughter of Jewish migrants who came to Australia early last century, as a safe haven from European antisemitism. The Deborah Cass Prize goes to new writing, by early career authors, who must have a migrant background. Our criterion for eligibility is that the author must either be born overseas or have at least one parent who was. Around 40% of the people in Australia are migrants themselves or the child of a migrant. Writers Victoria administers and promotes the prize. The Australian story is largely a story of migration and its aftermath. Refugees and those simply seeking a better life shaped our nation, enriched the culture and made a vast contribution to the economy, as labour, consumers and entrepreneurs. In the USA it is estimated that more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. In Australia, the haters – and their fellow travellers – keep prosecuting a tired old debate about whether to dismantle a law that was designed to reveal and condemn hate speech. As a lawyer, I bet Deborah would support using the law to sanction against hate speech. But as a humanist, I think she would have taken a broader view and argued that we must cultivate empathy. Of course we ought to condemn the most hateful speech. But surely our vision and thus our work should be in understanding different races and cultures. We need not just litigators but storytellers. Hate is not only a political strategy, it is a failure of imagination, a lack of empathy. We can’t legislate for imagination, we can only do what people have always done: tell new stories, build better worlds in the theatre of the mind. This year is the second year of the prize and the judging panel is again made up of three great writers: Tony Ayers, Alice Pung and Christos Tsiolkas. The judges are evidence – if you need it – that migrant communities give us wonderful stories and strong voices, enriching Australia to the benefit of everyone. The 2016 Deborah Cass Writing Prize will be awarded on 6pm, Tuesday 13 December at Centre for Contemporary Photography, 404 George Street Fitzroy."
2016-11-22T16:02:24Z,Five ways to help migrant children settle in your class,"The issue of migration is rarely out of the news at the moment, but migration is nothing new to the UK. Despite having decades to ensure policy and practice helps migrant pupils settle and feel included, research shows that migrant pupils in our schools have varying experiences of education. Migrant children will often have travelled a long way, possibly in difficult circumstances. They will probably be tackling language and cultural barriers, and then they have to get to grips with the expectations of a new teacher. So what can educators do to make this process as smooth as possible?Let them be the experts Migrant children are the experts on their own lives; the best way to find out about them – their previous experiences, their interests, likes and dislikes – is to ask them. For example, children from the Middle East may want to contribute during RE lessons about Islam; some will know more than the teacher. Rather than seeing this as a challenge to your authority, be ready to draw on their knowledge (and don’t get flustered when they correct your pronunciation of “Qur’an”). Treat them as experts, get to know them as human beings, and encourage everyone else in the class to do the same. Represent them Our experience has shown that a crucial question in multi-ethnic schools is whether students can “see themselves” in the “story” of the curriculum. The key to including migrant children is for teachers to be creative with the curriculum, choosing topics to reflect the range of children’s cultural identities and experiences. This can build confidence and a sense of pride in their home countries while offering valuable learning opportunities for their classmates. If you have a new child from Rwanda, for example, why not use your geography lessons to focus on the Rwandan rainforests? Being inclusive with parents is equally important; drawing on their knowledge can build stronger school-home links and help to include them in the school community. Get creative To engage migrant learners with the curriculum, we need to build their understanding in ways other than the “literal” – that which requires language. Picture books are a way to level the playing field for learners with different abilities in English. These books can tell complex stories that require little or no proficiency in English to enjoy. The Arrival by Shaun Tan, for example, is a beautifully illustrated but wordless book that tells a strange tale of migration and discovery: it is the perfect starting point for talking about journeys. Armin Greder, David Weisner and Anthony Browne write similarly engaging yet accessible books. Dance, art, drama and music are ideal avenues for engaging non-English speakers. As well as tapping into rich seams of cultural tradition, they can be a welcome relief from using words and an opportunity for non-English speakers to shine. Encourage collaboration Enabling migrant children to work together means that they can share linguistic and emotional knowledge – they may have been through similar experiences. This could mean buddying up children who have the same home language in class or at playtime, but sometimes it does not even require a shared spoken language – we often find that children are much more creative than we are in being able to communicate with each other, such as when a new arrival from Latvia was described by a less-new-arrival from Sudan as being “really funny” despite neither of them understanding a word of what the other way saying. But avoid grouping all EAL pupils together all the time – the children we speak to tell us that they want to mix it up sometimes. Don’t underestimate them A fundamental reminder: although it is important to consider the additional things we need to do to support migrant children, we should not underestimate them or think their academic abilities are the same as their English language skills. These children may be high-achievers in their home countries and their level of literacy in English may not necessarily reflect their capability overall. Don’t let lack of English language literacy be a barrier – you may have the next Nobel Laureate in your class.

2016-09-21T13:45:56Z,Migrant boat capsizes off Egyptian coast,"Dozens of people have died and officials fear hundreds more have been lost at sea after a boat carrying 600 migrants capsized off the north Egyptian coast, as world leaders gathered at a summit in New York to discuss the refugee crisis. Rescuers have brought more than 150 people ashore and recovered 43 bodies, including several women and a child, and hundreds more are missing, according to local officials and news agencies said. “We are deeply concerned at reports that hundreds of people may be missing at sea,” said Matthew Saltmarsh, spokesman for the United Nation’s refugee agency, UNHCR. “Events like this highlight the importance of rescue operations as part of the response to the movement of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean and the need for real, safer alternatives for people needing international protection.” Like most boats used for human trafficking, the ship that sank not far off the Egyptian coast appeared to have been dangerously overloaded, security officials said. Smugglers operating from Egypt often use old fishing boats for the long journey to Italy. Manypassengers are crammed below deck, with little chance of surviving if the boat sinks. “Initial information indicates that the boat sank because it was carrying more people than its limit. The boat tilted and the migrants fell into the water,” a senior security official in northern Beheira province told Reuters. He said the dead were mostly Egyptian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali nationals. Relatives of missing Egyptians gathered at a coastguard post to wait for news within hours of the tragedy. “I am not going to leave until I see Mohamed,” Ratiba Ghonim told Reuters, as she mourned her 16-year-old brother. “It is his destiny to leave yesterday and come back dead today. They still haven’t pulled his body out of the water.” The tragedy is part of a growing human trafficking problem out of the country. Neighbouring Libya is still the starting point for most efforts to reach Italy by boat from north Africa but, after years of lawless chaos in the region, a rising number of people are setting out from Egypt instead. In the first seven months of this year, Italian data showed that the number of migrants who reached the country by boat from Egypt was nearly 70% higher than the same period of last year. Arrivals from Libya fell slightly. A safer embarkation point has not made the journey itself any less perilous. Thousands of people have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean, with nearly 3,000 dead or missing in the first eight months of this year, according to UN data. The deadliest month was May, when hundreds of people died in three separate incidents that overwhelmed rescuers. In June, more than 300 migrants who had set off from Egypt died when their boat capsized near Crete. Rescue services are patchy, a mix of privately funded operations and an EU anti-smuggling mission that helps out with rescues when needed, but is not officially assigned to search and rescue operations. Charities have warned that the Mediterranean is becoming a “mass grave” as Europe looks away from tragedy. Crossings from Turkey to Greece fell dramatically after an EU-Turkey pact earlier this year, that aimed to deter prospective migrants by promising the deportation of most people arriving through that route. Several thousand people are still risking that voyage each month and experts say only the prospect of safe and effective resettlement schemes will stem the flow of people risking their lives. At the summit in New York this week, the US president, Barack Obama, announced that a coalition of more than 30 countries had agreed to concrete measures to tackle the refugee crisis. They include a commitment to double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults."
2016-10-29T07:00:13Z,Refugees exchange squalor of Calais for vineyards of Burgundy,"Outside the Château de Montlaville in the wine village of Chardonnay, the faint tapping sound of a table tennis match coming from a veranda was the only sign of the 21 refugees who had been bussed from the squalid Calais camp to a temporary new home amid the vineyards of Burgundy. “I’d forgotten what it felt like to sleep in a bed or to be warm,” said Ahmed, 25, who fled violence in Sudan and spent months in Calais living in a damp, leaking tent, hoping he could stowaway on a lorry to Kent. “It’s a relief to begin to feel safe now,” he said. He queued from 5am to be on the first French government bus out of Calais this week, as the state moved thousands of refugees and migrants to towns and villages across France when demolition of the camp began. On the eight-hour journey through the French countryside, he stared at the motorway with no idea where he was going to end up. “All I knew was that I had to give up on England and try for a new life in France. Now I want to learn French, settle, be safe, give something back.” His new home was a shared room in this manor house in the Burgundy village that gave its name to the Chardonnay white grape. It was not a grandiose château but a basic former holiday retreat for groups of children and teenagers who once camped in the garden. In total, 450 properties across France have been swiftly found to serve as temporary accommodation centres for the Calais refugees and migrants – ranging from a disused geriatric hospital in the Brittany oyster town of Cancale to former children’s holiday camps in rural villages or empty council flats in an apartment block outside the southern city of Toulouse. The refugees and migrants can only stay there for up to three or four months to – as the government said – “reflect on their future”, rest and, if they choose, begin the process to apply for asylum before being moved on to other specialised centres for asylum seekers. These temporary reception centres are the latest stopping place in an ongoing journey that to many still seemed as if it would never end. But volunteer doctors were on hand to diagnose and examine the physical condition and potential post-traumatic stress of people who fled home and pushed on for over a year without attending to their health. For many, the first few days was spent gently recovering as the exhaustion from their travels finally set in. For most, their first aim was pressing: to learn French as fast as possible. Ahmed had stepped outside to walk through Chardonnay, which has only 90 residents in its cluster of houses, with a total population of 200 including the farm houses set in the surrounding vineyards. He and four other Sudanese men had wanted to find a supermarket, but the quiet village has no shops, the nearest supermarket was 8km away. Looking out at the autumn colours of the vineyards stretching as far as the eye could see, the stress and exhaustion from the Calais camp was clear in his face. The rural landscape and the quiet of the village seemed a little disorienting after the upheaval, and months of travelling across Africa and Europe. “I know one day in the future everything will be ok, but there’s still further to go. It’s not over yet,” he said. When the first coach arrived from Calais this week, several volunteers from the village were organising how they could help with French lessons, activities and donations. But the far-right and some of the French right have launched a nationwide “Not in my village” campaign against taking the Calais migrants, and some in Chardonnay were critical of their arrival. Paul Perre, the mayor of Chardonnay, told the Guardian he wasn’t consulted on the plan to house the refugees and migrants, which was decided by the state prefect, and he didn’t like it. “I didn’t agree with a massive arrival,” he said. “Two to three families would have been better perceived in the village, better adapted to a village with only 90 people.” The state prefect’s office insisted that the French republic had a “humanitarian duty of solidarity” to help those who had been sleeping rough in Calais. This summer, Chardonnay had already provided a temporary home for 30 people when police cleared a fetid squatter camp south of Dunkirk on the northern coast and bussed the refugees and migrants south. Their stay passed well. But at a village meeting, some locals had voiced their opposition, complaining that having refugees in Chardonnay was a security risk, that they would scare children waiting for the school bus in the morning, prove damaging to the village or that house-prices would drop. One local alleged that migrants had once taken a bunch of grapes from a vine. Others complained that refugees’ bikes didn’t have proper lights on them. On Saturday, Marine Le Pen’s far-right Front National intends to hold a rally in the nearby commune of Digoin against the Calais migrants being brought there and to Chardonnay. In her stone house in the village, Fabienne Durcy, a French teacher, sat at her wooden dining table planning her voluntary language lessons for the arrivals from Calais, and preparing to welcome the migrants. She had already taught the men who were brought to Chardonnay this summer from the squat near Dunkirk. “They were incredibly dedicated to learning French,” she said. “At first they were very tired after all that they’d lived through, and they rarely left the reception centre, but after about two weeks you could see the change in their faces as life began to normalise.” Christophe Lambert, an art teacher who also gave voluntary lessons to the migrants, had founded a local association, Amigrants de Chardonnay, or Chardonnay Friends of Migrants, to counter what he felt was a barrage of negative campaigning from the right and far-right. He said: “I tell people: ‘If my son or daughter was far away, needed help and had nothing, I would hope that someone helped them.’ That often changes the way people think about it.” He said Chardonnay had a track-record of social involvement going back to the second world war, in the French resistance and in setting up local wine co-operatives to help poverty-stricken families. One 85-year-old woman who lived nearby said: “I lived through the war, we always had our suitcase ready. So I’m not surprised to see others who have fled their homes elsewhere.” The year’s grape harvest is over, and there is no a question of refugees and migrants working in the village, as they will claim asylum later via bigger towns. “The first thing I want to do is learn French, then one day work,” said one Sudanese man outside the manor house. “It’s very good to be here, yet normal life still feels far off.”"
2016-10-20T14:29:27Z,Calais migrant children cover their faces as they arrive in UK,"Some of the latest unaccompanied refugee children to travel from Calais to London covered their faces as they arrived, following a row about the ages of the first teenagers to be rescued. Their attempt to conceal their faces on Thursday came amid frustration from campaigners that the Home Office has not done enough to protect the anonymity of those being helped. Fourteen children arrived at an immigration centre in Croydon, south London, on Thursday morning, before the camp in Calais is expected to be demolished on Monday. Among the group were five boys aged 12 to 14. There were also six boys and three girls described as slightly older teenagers. Six youngsters, including all the girls, covered their heads and faces in towels as they were greeted by reporters and photographers. More than 50 of over 1,000 children in the camp have arrived in the UK under a programme to resettle unaccompanied minors. The latest group were the first to cover their faces, according to volunteers. James Asfa, a community organiser with Citizens UK – which is helping coordinate the arrival of the children – said: “The first few children came out without covers. The second group didn’t want to be photographed but there was a concern the photographers would continue despite being asked not to by volunteers so they put blankets over themselves just before they got off the bus for protection.” Another source working with the children said: “Lots of them don’t want the invasive photography that some of their peers had earlier in the week.” Media coverage of the first arrivals and a call by the Tory MP David Davies to force them to undergo dental or hand x-rays to verify their ages have been widely criticised. Josie Naughton, the co-founder of Help Refugees, urged the Home Office to do more to protect the identities of the children. “Exposing them to the media is disrespectful and hugely unkind. The media attention makes the public think the government is doing something, that the crisis is over. It isn’t. [Fewer] than 100 children have come to the UK this week and there are thousands more. “These children’s lives are their own and not public property. There are laws protecting children in the UK. Why isn’t it the same for them? It is super important to remember these are vulnerable children fleeing war and conflict and unimaginable experiences. They deserve privacy and respect.” The Home Office said in a statement: “Our focus is, and will continue to be, transferring eligible children and young people from Calais to the UK before the camp clearance begins. We urge everyone, including the media, to respect the privacy of these vulnerable individuals.” Security outside the Home Office building was significantly increased as the fourth group of child refugees prepared to leave. By Thursday afternoon, screens, yellow tape and metal fences had been erected around the exit, in a belated attempt to protect the identities of the children. Despite the increased security no children were seen leaving the building by that exit, instead leaving separately with volunteers. Meanwhile, the fostering and adoption charity Tact has distanced itself from a claim on its Twitter account that concerned the status of a male widely pictured on stories about the refugee children arriving in Britain. After the Sun and other newspapers suggested the male was an asylum seeker, the tweet claimed he was an interpreter instead. The Home Office confirmed on Thursday that the man was not one of its interpreters. And Tact said in a statement: “Our information was from a credible source. However, if the male is indeed a migrant and not an interpreter, Tact regrets any concern caused. The tweet has now been withdrawn as we do not want to cause any further distress to the individual depicted.”"
2016-10-17T19:57:44Z,The UK must fulfil its moral duty to Calais’ unaccompanied children | Bernard Cazeneuve,"The issue of the Calais camp and the situation of the migrants has sparked conflict between public opinion in the UK and France. Our two countries are attached to broadly the same values and the same goals: respecting the right to asylum and regulating migration, while honouring both treaty and moral obligations. But we need to find a common outlook on the current position in Calais if we are to avoid passing between us the blame for a situation that everyone agrees is a disaster. From the point of view of some in France, the Calais migrants’ misery is entirely down to the selfishness of the British government. London, they believe, is hiding behind the Le Touquet agreements governing controls on entry from continental Europe to the UK. They accuse the UK of using these agreements in an unscrupulous way, as a means of refusing to take in refugees fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, including unaccompanied children with family connections in the UK. Conversely, the British press is quick to accuse the French government of inefficiency as well as inhumanity. We are accused of being too slow to process asylum applications, and of being indifferent to the human stories behind each set of forms. The reality, of course, is that neither government has chosen to leave people with the right to refugee status in the cold and the mud – women and children least of all. Over the past year, 6,000 people have been moved from the Calais and Dunkirk camps to 164 reception and guidance centres the French government has opened throughout France, with the aim of integrating the migrants into their host towns. This method has been proved to work, and its success is the reason why the French government has now decided to dismantle the Calais camp for good. Because they share a moral responsibility towards them, the governments of France and the UK are determined to succeed with this operation together. Our countries must act together to shelter those people who are on their border and who clearly need protection – above all the most vulnerable among them. The British government has pledged to help solve this crisis by taking in some unaccompanied minors, the vast majority of whom have expressed the wish to go to the UK. Because they share a moral responsibility towards them, the governments of France and the UK are determined to succeed with this operation together. Our countries must act together to shelter those people who are on their border and who clearly need protection – above all the most vulnerable among them. The UK government now needs to intensify this effort, so that every unaccompanied minor can benefit from fair, lasting protection. The first transfers of young people with close relatives in the UK begin this week, while France has agreed to take in 13,000 refugees. The British government now needs to intensify its efforts to identify and resettle child migrants. This humanitarian operation must be supported by long-term measures aimed at making the border impenetrable at Calais and other Channel ports – because if the border is porous, people-smuggling rings will exploit their weaknesses to hold out to their victims the possibility of an illegal crossing to the UK, hiding from them the mortal risks to which they will expose themselves on the way. The UK government has already done a great deal to support us in these efforts. Thanks to the cooperation between our police services, 33 illegal immigration networks smuggling people into the UK have already been dismantled in France since the beginning of this year. In the longer term, neither the UK nor France can abdicate our responsibilities regarding the migration crisis across our continent. For obvious geographical reasons, ours are not countries of first entry like Greece and Italy, or even the countries most affected, in terms of flows of refugees. But the UK is the country that invented habeas corpus and France is the country that proclaimed the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen. We also each exercise singular international responsibilities, stemming from our history, defence capabilities and status as permanent members of the UN security council. As such, we must not just prevent migrants from living in precarious conditions on our soil, be it in the area around Calais or on the Kent coast. We must also act together to ensure that refugees aspiring to gain asylum in Europe are dealt with in conditions of solidarity and humanity, in a manner in keeping with the history and the values of our two countries."
2016-11-17T22:19:07Z,US detention facility restricts use of crayons for migrant children,"Young migrant children held in one of the most controversial privatised detention centres in the US have been restricted from playing with crayons after staff members accused them of causing damage to property. The move has been branded as unnecessarily punitive by lawyers working on behalf of 600 mothers and children detained at the Karnes detention centre in Texas. The centre at Karnes is one of three federal facilities that holds migrant mothers and children. These family centres are one of the most controversial elements of the Obama administration’s border protection program, which looks set to rapidly expand under the incoming Donald Trump presidency. A spokeswoman for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), which provides pro bono legal support to detainees at Karnes, said detention centre staff enforced the ban after accusing children of damaging a table as they drew inside the prison’s visitation centre last week. The damage is said to have occurred as some mothers were taking legal advice. In email correspondence seen by the Guardian, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staff state the punishment was “an action resulting from crayons which RAICES staff/volunteers have given children which has caused property damage to the contractor”. The GEO group, the $2bn global security company that operates the centre, has made over $57m from it since November last year, according to local media reports. A spokesman for GEO group said “crayons, toys and books etc” were provided to children in other sectors of the detention centre, and the restriction only affected children playing in the visitors area. Barbara Hines an adjunct professor at the University of Texas and RAICES member said in a letter to ICE that the reaction was disproportionate. “Treating a child’s color markings as ‘destruction of property’ is altogether inappropriate. And such markings are a cost that comes with the detention of children. It is extremely disturbing that ICE’s concern for GEO’s property takes precedence over the well being of the children and their mothers’ rights to legal advice,” she wrote. In an emailed statement, one 23-year-old detained mother said banning her children from drawing with crayons was already having an adverse effect. “They are too young to read and if they just play can get too rowdy. We don’t always want them with us because some of the things we share we don’t want them to hear,” the mother said. ICE did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. This story was updated with comment from the GEO group."
2016-10-27T09:19:43Z,'Offers of help flooded in': The councils that are helping refugees,"In Bristol, a house awaits. There is food in the cupboards. Beds are made up with crisp blue linen. A cheery red hot water bottle has been placed on each duvet. This is a home for a family about to arrive on the official Home Office sponsored Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement programme: the Labour-controlled city council has taken in 35 Syrians to date, and is now preparing for more. But getting to this point has not been an easy journey, as Loubaba Mamluk, a research epidemiologist at Bristol university who co-chairs the local Citizens UK campaign group explains. “It was 18 months ago that a small group of concerned people got together, and asked for a meeting with the council,” she recalls. Mamluk is Syrian, and was reeling from the devastation being wreaked on her country. She was not an expert in refugee resettlement, and nor were any of the rest of the group. Nor, as it turned out, was Bristol city council. During the meeting with officials – “it was six of us and three of them, and we were describing the problem, and there was a bit of emotion going on” she recalls – it became evident to Mamluk that the feeling from the council side was more about asking advice than giving it. “It was very frustrating” she says. “We were not the council - we felt they should be telling us!” There was no doubt as to the council’s desire to help, Mamluk says. But it may be telling that confusion about how to approach the task was the initial reaction even in one of the UK’s largest and most diverse cities. The expansion of the government’s existing vulnerable persons resettlement scheme to take another 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years had not yet been announced, and the funding mechanism for taking people in was far from clear, remembers Mike Hennessey, Bristol’s director of adult social care, who has led on this project from the start. Traumatised refugees cannot simply be flown here and dropped anywhere. “We knew that to create any basis for a productive life, people needed somewhere to live. And housing is in very short supply in Bristol,” Hennessey explains. He also knew that education, health and therapeutic support from organisations such as The Haven would need to be brought on board. The political challenges were considerable. This may be why four Conservative councils now taking Syrian refugees have either refused to speak to the Guardian or failed to reply to repeated interview requests. Housing is a hot potato across the country: despite this, it is interesting to note that, just north of Bristol, LibDem-controlled Cheltenham has opted to make 100 social housing homes available to Syrian refugees. The town is now home to 19 Syrians, and more houses are on offer. Cheltenham’s cabinet member for housing Peter Jeffries acknowledges the potential for criticism, but says these are people “who have nothing other than the clothes they stand up in, refugees, displaced by wars ... I think the number we are taking is pitiful. We should be doing more, and it should be speeded up.” In Bristol, a city where there are already 8,000 people on the housing register, the decision was made that social housing would not be used, so the Citizens UK group mobilised contacts in the media to make a plea to private landlords. After each appeal, offers of help flooded in: managing the public response and the project overall has required the equivalent of one salaried post. Hennessey has also been challenged by organisations already working with refugees: “One person said to me, ‘we’re supporting 400 people and you’ve got a whole working group supporting [at that time] eight.’” It was, he says, a fair point – the Syrian scheme has created a hierarchy of refugees: most in the city are scraping by with very little recourse to public funds at all. Even on the resettlement programme, Home Office funding does not fully meet the cost of renting and furnishing a home. Individuals and businesses in Bristol have responded by donating many of the items needed. But the way the council has managed the money, so that the people who need more support get it and funding can be reallocated from those who are more self-sufficient more quickly, means, Hennessey says, that it is now nearly enough. Perhaps because of the energetic outreach and communication by Mamluk and her fellow volunteers – the Citizens UK group have convened city-wide discussion forums, organised Welcome Refugees marches and rallies, and invited Bristolians to help with befriending, English lessons and practical tasks – Hennessey believes concerns about the political sensitivities have been allayed. “We have not experienced any adverse reaction. What we have had is neighbours who’ve made biscuits to welcome families, and people who’ve tidied their gardens. We’re not letting this disadvantage other people, we’re talking about people being contributors.” The council and Citizens UK are soon to launch a campaign entitled 25 Homes, 100 Lives, which states the scale of the ambition for the city, and are working together on how best to provide for the 10 unaccompanied child refugees Bristol has initially committed to take; five immediately, five in the coming weeks. “I feel like the lesson of why Bristol is looked at as a successful resettlement programme, is that we did a successful co-production between so many organisations,” says Mamluk. “We looked at their fears and we looked at our ambitions, and tried to find a happy place, because that is the only way.” More houses are set to be approved by Bristol council. And when the next families arrive, they will see that someone put food in the kitchen. Someone donated bed linen, and someone ironed it. Someone constructed 15 flat-pack beds instead of having a weekend. Someone carefully laid the red hot water bottles on the duvets, because they didn’t want children to feel cold as they fell asleep on their first night in this country. And so yes, this is a story about civic leadership. But it is also, importantly, a story about love.

2016-09-19T03:42:11Z,Europe can learn from Australia's border policy. But not by listening to Abbott | Melissa Conley Tyler,"This weekend former prime minister Tony Abbott has been explaining to European conservatives why they should heed Australia’s success in controlling its borders. Speaking to the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists in Prague, he characterised the Europe’s current migration crisis as having the look of a “peaceful invasion” that could over time could become “an existential challenge”. His words would have found a receptive audience: retiring UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage has approved of Australia’s migration policy as a model and others across Europe have been reported as drawing inspiration from Australia. Tony Abbott’s message to European leaders was clear: if only they were as tough as he had been, they too could “stop the boats”. Unfortunately, this is the wrong message to take from the Australian experience. Instead, here are the three lessons Europeans should take. Costs too much The reality is that most countries won’t be able to use Australia’s techniques to stop people movements due to the number of arrivals and the prohibitive expense involved. It is true that Australia has had success in stopping the boats through disrupting people smugglers’ business model. This has involved turning back boats to Indonesia, offshore processing and the use of detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea based on a policy that boat arrivals will never be resettled in Australia. Australia has shown that government can influence the number of arrivals through policy settings. However, Australia’s success is not replicable in most other countries. It can only be attempted by the richest of countries which have low refugee numbers. Per capita, the financial cost is enormous. This week’s Australian National Audit Office report details a cost of $573,111 per person per year for holding on Manus Island and Nauru. Australia spends more than $1bn per year on offshore processing for fewer than 2,000 people. This is not a model the EU can emulate with migration flows of more than 200,000 in January to May this year alone. It is also worth mentioning the non-fiscal costs related to this policy. Australia’s international relationships have been effected, particularly with Nauru and Papua New Guinea where Australia is accused of neo-colonialism and, crucially, with rising power Indonesia where issues around migration have created friction in one of Australia’s most important relationships. The detention of refugees has a demonstrably high cost for those in detention. The Australian Human Rights Commission’s National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention is unequivocal on the negative impact of prolonged detention on detainees’ mental and physical health. The bottom line is that you can’t stop people movements of the scale occurring in Europe by adopting Australia’s border policies. Migration can work The second lesson to be taken from Australia is more positive: it is that mass migration can really work. The Australian experience shows the economic and cultural benefits of mass migration. From a small white settler society at the end of the second world war, Australia has been transformed to a vibrant multicultural nation. Statistics show that 28% of the population was born overseas – with at least another 20% the child of an overseas-born parent. This is a dramatic change and results have been broadly positive. For example, Australia is one of only three countries in the world where children of migrants score better at school than children of non-migrants. Australia has reaped the economic benefits of migration. Tracing Australia’s history, George Megalogenis links periods of economic growth to times when Australia was open to migration. The current prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, drew this lesson: “openness and multiculturalism based on mutual respect is what has defined most of the most successful societies in the world”. When Europeans worry about the impossibility of integration of those with different cultural or religious backgrounds, Australia is a salutary case study of what is possible. It’s under control The final lesson to be drawn from Australia is that the second lesson is tied to the first: to achieve societal acceptance of mass migration, the public has to be convinced that the process is under control. This is the fascinating lesson from John Howard’s prime ministership. The prime minister who took such a hard line on border security was also the one who oversaw significant increases in overall migration; in 2007 the number of permanent migrants hit 191,000: the largest cohort since the second world war. He understood this truth: that to build acceptance of mass migration, governments have to convince the public that the process is under control. The core aim of Australia’s migration program is that it is orderly. South Sudanese who wait patiently in refugee camps can be resettled through a humanitarian program. The announcement of 12,000 places for carefully checked and screened Syrian refugees was welcomed. By contrast, news reports of people arriving “uninvited” by boat taps into the national neurosis about being overrun by swarms from the north. At a time when a huge number of people are on the move and where very few countries accept long-term resettlement, we need to think about what we can do to help prepare our populations to understand and respond. In this context it’s vital to draw the right lessons from Australia’s experience. Melissa Conley Tyler is the national executive director of the Australian Institute of International Affairs."
2016-07-13T15:02:10Z,EU officials finalise common asylum system to resettle refugees,"European officials have finalised plans to create a common EU asylum system and refugee resettlement scheme, which advocates portray as the solution to the European migration crisis but which critics believe will be a further betrayal of refugee rights. Officials have proposed creating a semi-standardised system that would allow asylum seekers to expect similar treatment in whichever country they settle. The arrival of more than 1 million people in Europe in 2015 exposed differences between the continent’s different asylum procedures. It is hoped that the proposed system would discourage the kind of country-hopping that saw hundreds of thousands of refugees settle in Germany last year having passed through other European countries such as Hungary and Greece. The plans also include the establishment of a common European policy on refugee resettlement. The policy’s proposers say it could allow Europe to resettle thousands of refugees through legal means, and so discourage the unusually high levels of irregular migration seen in 2015. Commenting on the resettlement scheme, the EU’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said: “Today’s proposal is a major step in our efforts to offer legal avenues to allow persons in need to enter the EU safely and receive protection. It is an integral part of the larger objective of ensuring that protection is offered to those who need it, reducing the incentives for irregular migration, and protecting migrants from exploitation by smuggling networks and dangerous journeys to reach Europe.” But other European officials and rights campaigners criticised the proposals, which they said would in reality lead to fewer refugees being given sanctuary in Europe. Under the plan, refugees will only be formally resettled in Europe from third countries that agree to readmit migrants who arrived in Europe by informal means. Additionally, the plans make it easier for refugees to be expelled from Europe in the first place. Brussels would be given greater say over which countries are deemed safe for refugees – overriding the wishes of independent appeals boards in nation states. In the current context, this would theoretically allow the EU to expel more people from Greece to Turkey, despite Greek officials deeming Turkey unsafe for some refugees. Expanding on these criticisms, John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Europe director, said: “The proposals the commission published today are not about improving refugee protection globally, but about reducing irregular arrivals to Europe. They take good tools, like resettlement, and put them to bad ends; they use fine words, but these mask some pretty cynical intentions.” Dalhuisen added: “What the commission is really trying to do with these proposals is resettle some refugees so they can return more. In the absence of any mention of the need to significantly increase resettlement numbers and heavily invest in conditions for refugees in third countries, the net impact of these proposals for refugee protection globally is very likely to be negative.” Malin Björk, the European parliament’s rapporteur on the proposal, called it “disgraceful”. The Swedish politician said: “As the parliament’s rapporteur, I will do what I can to stop this distortion of the international right to asylum and the notion of global responsibility and solidarity.” The draft law is likely to be amended by EU home affairs ministers and the European parliament, who will determine the final legislation. Politicians have dwindling confidence in the viability of common European asylum policies due to the failure of their previous incarnations. Last September, European leaders promised to relieve Greece and Italy of 160,000 refugees stranded on their territory. On Wednesday the EU admitted that member states had accepted just 3,056 – nearly 10 months after promising to help out. Only 8,268 refugees have been resettled directly from the Middle East, despite a promise almost a year ago to resettle 22,504."
2016-08-20T09:00:00Z,Is Uganda the best place to be a refugee?,"When they fled to Kampala from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in February 2008, Robert Hakiza’s family had food for two months. “The third month was a disaster,” he says. By May, though, his mother and two sisters were out making money. “My sister started selling necklaces,” he says. “At one point, she was keeping the entire family of eight.” Eight years on, the organisation Hakiza founded, Young African Refugees for Integral Development, employs 16 staff, comprising both refugees and Ugandans. Though his sisters dream of resettlement elsewhere, he is content. “Uganda is one of the best places to stay for refugees,” he says. By 2015, Uganda had become the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, after Ethiopia and Kenya, with more than half a million refugees. That number is rising rapidly. Alongside ongoing crises in Burundi and DRC, violence in South Sudan has driven more refugees to Uganda during three weeks in July than in the first six months of 2016. The Danish Refugee Council warned last month the situation in northern Uganda could become “catastrophic” if they don’t receive more support for assisting the influx of refugees from South Sudan. But these recent arrivals are among the lucky ones: Uganda is one of the most favourable environments in the world for refugees, according to the UNHCR. While many countries keep refugees in camps away from citizens, Uganda allows them to set up businesses, work for others, and move freely around the country. The majority of refugees live in Uganda’s rural settlements, where they are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home, as well as food aid and access to basic health and education services. But they are also free to build a life in Kampala – where 74,896 refugees and asylum seekers were registered as of May 2016 – as Patrick,* who arrived from Rwanda in 2009 did. Today, he owns a shop and three motorcycle taxis, and employs workers on his land. Refugees in Uganda’s rural settlements are allocated plots of land and given materials to build a basic home – so that investment in infrastructure benefits locals too; they also receive food aid and access to primary schools and health services. However, some other nationals in Uganda feel restricted by their refugee status. Although the authorities say people are free to come and go, Michael*, a Congolese artist who arrived in Nakivale settlement in 2010, says: “If someone doesn’t agree with you they can just stop you [from doing what you want].” Sometimes the problem is unclear communication. Hakiza remembers brandishing a copy of the Refugee Act when he first went to register his organisation with the local authorities; they had had told him he wasn’t allowed. Mimy Abeja, a Congolese single mother of 10, says Nakivale is “not a place to raise children”. She is relieved not to be paying rent, but struggles to keep her tailoring business afloat, adding that all of the family have been in and out of hospital since they arrived. A study from the Centre for International Governance Innovation in 2015 found that, rather than being genuinely self-sufficient, most in Nakivale were “engaged in daily survival tactics”. Countrywide, most refugees live at subsistence level, says David Kigozi, a senior programme officer at the Kampala-based International Refugee Rights Initiative, pointing out that over 70% depend on the World Food Programme. “Every day we wake up fighting because of our stomachs,” says 29-year-old Alex Bucunga, a filmmaker who arrived from DRC nine years ago, explaining that food rations are reduced significantly for those here longer than five years. Casual work helps fill the gaps: Bucunga has taught English, while others dig farmland, make bricks or work as translators. That’s rarely sufficient to start or grow a business — but Nsamizi, a training institute and responsible for livelihoods support in Nakivale, says a revolving credit fund for refugees will be operational later this year. The fund will likely also be open to Ugandans: government guidelines state that around 30% of refugee assistance should help host communities. Under a new UN strategy, acknowledging the longevity of displacement, livelihoods programmes will target refugees and Ugandans together, and some basic services will be merged. Water services in Nakivale will be handed to the district authority, eventually requiring refugees to pay for water just as locals do. Similarly, the UNHCR will hand over responsibility of the only secondary school in the area to the government. And there’s even a suggestion of recruiting refugees into public service jobs, currently only open to Ugandans. Meanwhile, more refugees may travel to Uganda, especially if neighbouring Kenya keeps its promise to close its camps. Ugandans are “quite tolerant” for now, says Charity Ahumuza, a programme manager at the Refugee Law Project at Makerere University, Kampala. “But people will think: ‘If Kenya can say no, why should Uganda be generous?’” Her organisation is planning education activities this year to ensure public attitudes remain favourable. Attitudes in Europe, which wants to negotiate deals with some African countries to prevent migration outside the continent, could also affect how refugees are treated in Uganda. As Ahumuza notes, pushback from Europe “will definitely have an impact on how communities who’ve been hosting refugees will act”. Uganda may now look to rich countries to take on more responsibility. But, while the size of plots given to refugees has already been halved, the government has not indicated that it will limit its open door policy, and a newly-opened settlement area with room for up to 100,000 people is already welcoming refugees. “Where else in the region would they go?” asks Douglas Asiimwe, assistant commissioner for refugees. Many citizens — some of whom have been refugees themselves — share this view, providing some of the land allocated to newcomers. Even if the welcome continues, rising numbers of newcomers, severe funding shortages and further integration of assistance within national structures may encourage more realistic expectations among refugees. Jimmy Maguru, a project manager at Nsamizi, says Nakivale residents are taking more responsibility for their future than ever before — partly thanks to livelihoods projects, but also because “people are hearing that plot sizes are likely to get smaller”. Expectations of resettlement, though, may need to be addressed. Many hope for a future in North America or Europe — yet the UNHCR’s resettlement target for Nakivale, home to more than 110,000 refugees, is only around 700 this year. “People think the only one solution is resettlement [and that you’re a] failure if you don’t to go” says Michael, who is planning new community projects in Nakivale. “I want them to know they can start their life here.” *Names have been changed The reporter’s travel costs were covered by a One World Media grant Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

2016-11-02T19:29:29Z,Australia could double annual migration by 2054 and boost economy – report,"Australia could double its annual permanent migration over the next 40 years and reap significant economic benefits for the average person, according to a new report. But it could do so only with better long-term planning around population growth, with policies focused on infrastructure provision, urban congestion and environmental degradation. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) has released a report, “Migration: the economic debate”. It makes 17 recommendations to improve Australia’s migration program, saying changes are required to ensure it remains one of the best programs in the world. Bureau of Statistics figures show net overseas migration in 2014-15 recorded an annual increase of 168,200 people. Net overseas migration is the net gain or loss of population through immigration to Australia and emigration from Australia. But Ceda said that figure could rise to 400,000 by 2054, bringing beneficial economic consequences, if important changes were made to the program. Stephen Martin, the chief executive of Ceda, said Australia’s migration program had strong community support, but key aspects had the potential to undermine that support. “Concern over migration both domestically and internationally has been increasing, driven by fear-mongering coupled with genuine community (albeit misplaced) concern about security,” Martin said. “Public policy improvements are needed to ensure previous strong community support for migration is re-established, fair treatment for both temporary and permanent migrants, and that the country continues to reap the economic benefits from the skills that a balanced migration program brings.” The report called for an overhaul of the 457 visa program for temporary workers, saying the current system leaves migrants open to exploitation. It said it was no longer “inappropriate” to allow employers to say which occupations are in shortage, because that left a mismatch in supply and demand. It recommended the ministerial advisory council on skilled migration be overhauled so its membership included equal representation from business and unions, and independent experts. It said the council should also adopt an “evidence-based approach” to gathering information on which occupations should form part of the “occupational shortage list”, relying on input from stakeholders – through a formal and transparent submissions process – and on economic data. It said the council’s deliberations and recommendations should then be made publicly available. It also recommended that Australia’s working holiday visa program be capped, and that penalties for exploiting migrant workers be increased. It supported a recent Productivity Commission recommendation to shift to a “universal points test” for permanent skilled migrants, and to tighten entry requirements relating to age, skills and English-language proficiency. It said policymakers should also explore options to encourage settlement in regional areas, in particular Northern Australia, given the focus on driving investment and growth in that region. The 17 recommendations include: Consider the impact of the current migration program on Melbourne and Sydney and subsequent future infrastructure and services requirements. Provide a more robust model for determining occupation shortages with respect of 457 visas. Shift to a universal points test for permanent skilled migrants and tighten entry requirements relating to age, skills and English-language proficiency. Review and cap the working holiday visa program and possibly introduce a purpose-built guest worker program for specific industries struggling to attract adequate low-skilled workers. Increase penalties for exploiting migrant workers. Improve settlement services and support, access to English language pro-grams and recognition of foreign qualifications. Martin said with the right policies, Australia’s annual permanent migration intake could be increased significantly."
2016-10-24T10:12:57Z,Q&A: what happens now to the Calais refugees?,"Where are they going? Sixty buses will move the refugees and migrants to 164 reception centres across France. The accommodation centres, which are intended to be temporary, will each hold 40 to 50 people for up to four months while their asylum cases are examined. Those who do not claim asylum will be sent back to their country of origin. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed in the camp have said they do not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third say they will continue to try to get to the UK, according to the Refugee Rights Data Project. How many people live at the camp? The authorities say 7,000 people live here but charities put the number closer to 10,000. The French president, François Hollande, appeared to acknowledge that the official figure was an underestimate when he said last month that as many as 9,000 people could be moved from the camp to the reception centres. How will the camp be demolished? It is understood that 40 people will arrive on Tuesday to begin dismantling the camp. An additional 3,000 police are expected in and around Calais this week to assist with the process of clearing the camp and to attempt to ensure that migrants who do not want to claim asylum do not flee and/or set up new, smaller camps. With the eyes of the world on Calais, police are expected to try a soft approach, at least to begin with. There are fears that anarchists will stoke the atmosphere if French police are deemed to be heavy-handed. Why is this happening? France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, says the intention is to “unblock Calais”, which is said to have suffered serious economic security consequences as a result of the camp and the daily attempts by migrants to smuggle themselves on to lorries bound for Britain, sometimes leading to violent attacks on drivers. Politics has played a big part with the French right and far right increasing their calls for hardline action before next year’s presidential election. Alain Juppé, the current favourite to become the next president, has said France must push back its border with Britain from Calais to the Kent coast. The French government has also been under pressure to act to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the camp, where there is overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages as well as trafficking and exploitation of women and children. Hollande has said that conditions are not acceptable, especially for people fleeing war. What will happen to unaccompanied children? There is supposed to be a separate queue for the estimated 1,300 unaccompanied children in the camp at the warehouse that will act as a processing centre. About 500 are believed to be eligible to come to Britain under the amendment, brought about by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, himself a former child refugee. But campaigners fear that vulnerable minors could be lost in the chaos of the evacuation. Charity workers have expressed concern that children could be caught up in violence or left vulnerable to people traffickers. Have the French previously tried to clear the camp? In February and March, the authorities demolished a large area of the southern part of the camp, saying the aim was to radically reduce numbers of migrants. Police fired teargas at migrants who threw stones and set fire to shelters after dozens of makeshift shacks were dismantled. Despite the move, the number of people in the camp subsequently reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, exacerbating the overcrowding problem as an increased number of inhabitants were squeezed into an area of land less than half the size it previously was."
2016-09-17T20:20:04Z,‘They’ve brought evil out’: Hungary’s poll on migration divides a nation,"The Hungarian government’s map of Europe is dotted with stark warnings of “no-go zones” it claims are patrolled by violent immigrants, six in the UK clustered around London alone. The poisonous graphic, in a leaflet handed out to voters ahead of a controversial referendum on refugees, pays no heed to facts or geography but its message is clear. It forms part of an expensive and expansive campaign by authorities in Budapest that is whipping up xenophobic sentiment at home, and sowing tension far beyond Hungarian borders. The ballot, conceived and championed by prime minister Viktor Orbán, is ostensibly about whether parliament should allow the European Union to set a quota for refugee resettlement within the country. But critics contend that he is using groundless fear to bolster his position at home and shore up a challenge to Europe. They point out that the ballot comes as Europe is backing away from the mandatory quota system that officially inspired the campaign: there are just a few thousand refugees in Hungary today, and that number is unlikely to rise. Syrians, Afghans and others crossing into Europe are not drawn by dreams of a Hungarian future. “One has the suspicion that this referendum is not about the refugees, that it is rather about the manipulation of the voters, and some kind of strengthening of positions within the EU,” said pastor Gábor Iványi, a one-time ally in the anti-Communist movement who baptised two of Orbán’s children. “Hungary is not a target country in this refugee crisis.” A campaign that is already spreading hate at home risks having serious fallout for Europe as well, further fracturing leaders already split over everything from the refugee crisis to the euro’s woes, and potentially consolidating Orbán’s efforts to challenge the status quo with a bloc of other eastern nations. The language has been so violent that it fuelled demands from one European leader that Hungary be expelled from the union for stirring up hatred. Even stalwart supporters of Orbán’s initiative often admit they have had no interaction, much less trouble, with outsiders. “I’ve only met foreigners who are tourists and not had any problems,” said cheery retiree László Czeto, 87, firmly committed to supporting the government. “I just don’t want a lot of people to come to Hungary. I think they are not real refugees.” Yet there are clear political advantages to focusing on refugees – a target largely absent and unable to respond – at a time when Hungary is grappling with concerns from rampant graft to failing public services, critics say. A recent survey found that four in five young Hungarians think the state is riddled with corruption, and more than half have encountered it themselves. The country comes 50th in Transparency International’s ranking of corruption worldwide, and the state has been taking power away from anti-corruption bodies. “They don’t want people to speak about problems like corruption, and healthcare, they want people to talk about the nonexistent migrants,” said Gergely Kovács of activist group Two-Tailed Dog, a party originally launched as political satire that put pooches up as candidates, with manifestos promising free beer and eternal life to mock empty promises. But as the political landscape in Hungary grew bleaker, its founders were forced to become more serious, although humour is still used as their main weapon. “I’ve never seen so much hate in this country before,” said Kovács. “They have brought evil out and that’s why we felt we should do something.” A crowdfunded advertising campaign uses ridicule and well-chosen statistics to show up government fear-mongering. A poster warning that a million people in Libya want to come to Europe is matched by one reminding voters that a million Hungarians want to go to Europe; others warn of “dangers” ranging from the risk of drinking water spiked with LSD to medieval bear attacks. There is also a more serious campaign to persuade voters to spoil their ballots, perhaps the only way to fight back against Orbán because, in a country with a long history of unease with migrants and extensive government influence over the media, he is guaranteed an overwhelming majority. The only way that victory will be undermined is if turnout fails to meet the relatively high threshold needed for it to be legally binding. A history of voter apathy may be one reason for the aggressive campaign, opponents speculate. The government denies allegations of racism, and says the campaign is strictly factual. Yet it struggles to defend many of its claims, among them the “no-go zone” allegations which have echoes of claims made about Paris by US news channel Fox. Questioned about the map, government spokesman Zoltán Kovács claimed it was based on public statistics, but could not provide them to the Guardian and admitted it was deceptive. “It relates to London. The picture is a bit disproportionate,” he said, when asked about which areas were covered by the warning signs on the UK, sprinkled roughly from Peterborough to Southampton. He went on to cite riots in London’s south-east in 2011, before the Syrian war had begun in earnest, much less the refugee crisis it has sparked. And the campaign is already spreading poison across the country, said Demeter Áron from Amnesty international, who leads a group of charities monitoring hate crime. “One young boy, 14, from the poorest part of the country said ‘migrant’ had already become the playground insult of choice, replacing anti-gay and anti-Roma slurs,” he said. And it has made many of Hungary’s small minority population even more uncomfortable, both on the streets and in a society they already felt was ambivalent. “I don’t want to pay tax so people throw a referendum against me,” said Iranian refugee Behruz, 31, who has lived in Hungary for the past five years. “You are serving a society that is arming against you.” Immigration offers more opportunity to Hungary than its government will admit, because it has developed a labour crisis more or less in parallel with Europe’s refugee crisis. With hundreds of thousands of young people heading west, there is a huge shortage of workers. András Kováts, of charity Menedék, which has been working with refugees for more than 20 years, says that for the first time there are no problems finding jobs for new arrivals. “This is not about moral obligations, businesses need workers.” But immigration sits at the heart of Orbán’s challenge to Europe, and so economic growth is not a priority. “We don’t want to fill [jobs] with migration from other cultures,” Kovács added. Orbán has emerged as the most high-profile leader in a group of eastern European countries known as the Visegrád four – Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. They have a combined population equivalent to that of the UK and are increasingly vocal about their frustration with the status quo. In the continent’s current struggles with Brexit and the refugee and economic crises, Orbán has seen particular opportunity, talking openly this summer of an eastward shift in Europe’s centre of gravity. “If there is such a thing as an ‘old Europe’, it is here,” he told a student conference. “If we talk about how we envisage the capital of Europe, Budapest comes to mind more often than Brussels does.” Perhaps one reason that seems plausible is Orbán’s own dramatic political transformation, a full 180-degree turnaround from when he was a firebrand liberal opponent of communism and critic of Moscow, to a man whose economic and political project aligns closely with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I think he is pretty much aware of the fact that this referendum can contribute to the destabilisation of the EU when it is not in a good state and he knows that Putin will be grateful for that,” said Péter Krekó, an analyst with Hungarian thinktank Political Capital. In October, Orbán will be claiming a victory of sorts, even if his opponents or apathy manage to keep turnout low, as the majority polls show he is virtually guaranteed victory. But it will have come at the price of Hungary’s social fabric, and may prove dangerous for Hungary as well as Europe. “The main message of Christ was against hatred and fear,” said Pastor Iványi. “Someone who is building on these evil feelings is unleashing things which he or she will not be able to manage.”"
2016-12-22T11:30:45Z,"Thousands of refugees left in cold, as UN and EU accused of mismanagement","The UN refugee agency and the EU’s aid department have been accused by other aid groups of mismanaging a multimillion-pound fund earmarked for the most vulnerable refugees in Europe, leaving thousands sleeping in freezing conditions in Greece. The Greek government, which has ultimate jurisdiction over camp activities, has also been criticised for failing to use nearly €90m (£75m) of separate EU funding to adequately improve conditions at the camps before the onset of winter. No single actor has overall control of all funding and management decisions in the camps, allowing most parties to distance themselves from blame. The EU aid department, known as Echo, has given UNHCR more than €14m since April to help prepare roughly 50 refugee camps for the winter in Greece, where an estimated 50,000 mainly Syrian refugees have been stranded since the adoption of new European migration policies in March. A further €24m has been given to UNHCR for other projects. Both organisations stand accused by other aid groups of squandering this money, after failing to properly “winterise” or evacuate dozens of camps before snow fell in Greece earlier in December. In addition to providing warmer bedding and clothes, UNHCR was expected to use this money to move people from tents to heated containers or formal housing; heat warehouses where other refugees are living; provide a consistent supply of hot water; and install insulated flooring for anyone still left in tents. Months after the funds were dispersed, roughly half of those living in camps had yet to be transferred to formal housing by the onset of winter. Of the 45 camps that were still active at the start of the month, the Guardian visited or was made aware of at least 15 camps that had yet to be properly adapted by the time snow fell in northern Greece at the start of December. UNHCR admitted it was itself aware of only eight camps where all the residents have been moved out of tents and into prefabricated containers. In a recent UNHCR video, promoted by Echo, the two institutions hailed the success of their winterisation work. In early December, the EU also said that Greece was safe enough to return refugees there from other European countries. But refugees and independent aid workers say Echo and UNHCR had initially ignored the gravity of the situation. The head of Medécins Sans Frontières in Greece, Loic Jaeger, described the situation as a failure. “We are outraged about the positive communications [from UNHCR and the EU] that are completely disconnected with reality,” said Jaeger, speaking before UNHCR began to admit flaws in the process on 9 December. Jaeger said: “Our feeling is that there is a willingness now, led by the fact that there is a massive amount of money [allocated for winterisation], to try to present the situation as if it is OK. But it is not. On the islands we are still not even starting to winterise. In some places it’s working quite well, but in northern Greece you still have people sleeping in tents in the snow.” Jaeger added: “What is being done with all this money? Who is checking? Where is the report from the EU or UNHCR assessing what is still to be done? Where is the transparency? There is a discrepancy between what is claimed and what is the reality.” At three camps visited by the Guardian, three refugees with newborn babies condemned the freezing conditions their children had been left in. “It’s too cold here for a baby,” said Sonya, a 17-year-old Syrian Kurd, whose first child was born prematurely in the week that snow fell in Thessaloniki. Asked by the Guardian, both UNHCR and the EU released a breakdown of their spending on winterisation and other areas. More than 21,000 people have been placed in formal housing, the data shows – but an estimated 20,000 remained in camps in early December. Officials from both institutions partly blamed the cash-strapped Greek government for the failure to properly accommodate the refugees, who were left stranded on Greek territory by other EU countries in March. In response, Greece’s migration ministry said that while it was ultimately responsible for the camps, it was hamstrung by a lack of independent funding. EU funds are dispersed to the Greek army and other Greek institutions – and to UNHCR and 13 other large international agencies and charities – rather than the migration ministry itself. “We don’t have funds on our own,” said Nicholas Connolly Rangos, the ministry’s regional coordinator for northern Greece. “All we can do is push and push our Echo partners, UNHCR, and the big NGOs … [who] cannot overcome their internal processes to provide assistance sooner.” A spokesman for Echo highlighted how other wings of the EU have provided nearly €800m directly to Greek institutions, to help them respond to the refugee crisis. A breakdown of that spending shows that the EU has sent nearly €90m to Greek institutions to improve the camps – though none of it was specifically allocated for winterisation, unlike the €14m allocated to UNHCR. The ongoing blame game highlights the level of disorganisation across the entire response to the Greek refugee crisis. No single actor has overall control of all funding and management decisions in the camps. Throughout months of research in several sites across Greece, the Guardian has found that the EU, UNHCR, major NGOs, the Greek government and the Greek army all use the the absence of a clear chain of command to absolve themselves of responsibility for the dysfunctional system. Additionally, the Guardian has found that Echo dispersed nearly €190m to a group of major UN agencies and charities working in Greek refugee camps – without ensuring that the the aid would be spread equally across the camps. Only a few camps have designated funding for the full range of services offered by the charities. Guardian analysis of data provided by the EU shows that 19 camps receive no designated EU funding for water-related infrastructure such as toilets and showers; another 19 have no designated funding for healthcare; 10 receive no designated funding for psycho-social care; 26 receive no designated funding for child protection or child-friendly spaces; 25 receive no funding for female friendly spaces. Asked to comment on this analysis, the EU did not dispute the figures. Finally, grassroots groups claim that the recipients of this EU funding are often slow to spend it, forcing smaller volunteer-led groups to use their weaker resources to fill in the gaps. The Guardian has found evidence that in at least nine camps, grassroots groups have spent hundreds of thousands of euros on projects that should have been paid for with the funding supplied by the EU to the major charities. In the most telling example, a grassroots US-based charity claims it was left to pay more than €100,000 to winterise the camp of Oinofyta, in southern Greece. Lisa Campbell, the co-founder of Do Your Part, said: “Since no one else had any money, Do Your Part, a very small American organisation, is spending €115,000 so that refugees don’t have to stay outside during winter.” In northern Greece, the small charity RefuAid wants to set up long-term integration projects – but says it has been forced to spend most of its budget on short-term projects because larger NGOs have failed to use the EU funding that had been designated for that purpose. “Our organisation is about preparing for the long term, but instead we’re spending all our money on the short term because we’re having to step in for the larger NGOs,” said Anna Jones, RefuAid’s co-founder. “At least half our funding has been spent on short-term projects – around £20,000-25,000 – because larger organisations are not stepping up.” The EU denies that its money is being badly spent, and says it is doing all it can to monitor where its money goes. A spokesman said its partners were subject to four layers of control and that its funding was “the most thoroughly monitored and controlled of all international aid donated for the refugee crisis in Greece”. In response to questions about the winterisation process, UNHCR said: “As we are out there on the refugee sites every day, we understand and share your analysis that there are gaps. Just the other day, we brought 11 new-born babies out of tents into hotels because their tents had not been replaced by other accommodation. The [Greek migration] ministry had asked us to trouble-shoot and step in on that one. And we are seeing the consequences of the delays in other areas. Humanitarian actors, including us and the volunteers, are in facing serious challenges and trying to close the gaps.”"
2016-12-19T11:49:09Z,Greek hospitals deepen trauma for refugee women giving birth,"Refugee women in Greece are being traumatised by their experiences of giving birth, as understaffed hospitals perform medical procedures without consent or translators and with partners banned from the birth. Masooma Hezara, 23, from Afghanistan went into labour in September 36 weeks into her pregnancy. She had been living at Elliniko camp in southern Greece since she arrived in the country in February, already a few weeks pregnant. The conditions at the camp are poor; flimsy tents and blankets hung from string provide the only privacy. Hot water is sporadic and the filthy toilets and shower drains block up constantly. The stench of sewage permeates the lower floors, which flood whenever it rains. The noise makes it hard for people to sleep. She says she had to walk 20 minutes, in labour, to another nearby camp to get help, after a doctor refused to call an ambulance for her. There she was rushed to hospital where her husband was told he could not come into the room with her for the birth. Without a translator, she didn’t know she was undergoing an emergency caesarean until she heard her baby cry. “I knew nothing. They put an injection in my back. When I heard my baby cry, that’s when I realised what had happened and I fainted. My husband was outside the door and no one was telling him what was going on.” Masooma’s experience has left its mark. “When I think about how my baby was born, I get so angry and I feel like hitting her. I told the doctors at the camp about how I feel. They told me to take deep breaths.” She has since opted for long-term contraception provided by a medical NGO at the camp. “I don’t ever want to live through that again,” she says quietly. At Ritsona camp, one hour north of Athens, the conditions are slightly better, with prefab huts recently replacing small tents that families were living in. But some of the women living there have similar complaints about lack of consent during their births. “It’s a moment when you don’t know if you might live or die, and no one is with you,” says 17-year-old Roubin Riyad Dour from Syria. “I wanted to have my aunt with me, but they didn’t let me. I was alone and that made me feel very bad.” She says she was given an episiotomy without pain relief. “I begged for something and no one helped me. I said ‘I am in deep pain, please, I am in pain’ but they did nothing. They cut me down there and stitched me without giving me anything. I felt it all.” Another mother in the camp, Kurdish Mizkeen Abdullah Mizkeen recently gave birth to her fifth child. She took a male friend to translate and an old woman who wanted to support her during labour to Halkida’s hospital, but was not allowed to have either person with her while she gave birth. “I had stitches with no anaesthetic. My friend was outside the door trying to talk to the doctors and tell them I was in pain but no one listened. They left me to give birth like an animal.” A preliminary report on antenatal care, birth and postnatal care of refugees in Greece , collated by the legal group Hellenic Action for Human Rights, shows that of the 29 women questioned, 60 percent had received caesarean sections, in line with the extremely high caesarean rate in the general Greek population. Only one of these women was given an epidural, all the others were given a full anaesthetic even though there was no way to take any medical history because of a lack of translation. Every single one of the women reported having medical procedures carried out on them without consent or the chance to question the decision. One woman told researchers that doctors told her after her c-section that her uterus had been removed, though she had no idea why. Of the women who didn’t have a caesarean, only one was given pain relief, despite the others all attempting to ask for it through hand gestures. Greece has one of the most medicalised obstetric care systems in the world, with a caesarean rate of over 50% according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO’s recommended caesarean rate is from 10 to 15%. The average among EU member states is 25%. Dr Konstantinos Spiriounis, an obstetrician-gynecologist, is a member of the department of municipal clinics and public health in Athens and until June this year worked at one of the city’s main public maternity hospitals, Elena. He says that the country’s economic problems have led to a recruitment crisis, putting hospitals under pressure, but that doctors do their best in difficult circumstances. “There are no new hires happening in the hospitals, so us doctors in Greece in public hospitals have learnt to do the work of two or three people. “Many times the doctors and nurses stay on when their shift ends because there isn’t anyone else to do it. You are always concerned in that you will make a mistake or miss something important, because you are so exhausted. Sometimes we find we’re out of things like gauze or medical tape, and we go buy it ourselves from the pharmacy.” He says that all women are offered the same service, the best the doctors can provide. “We offer the same to everyone, whether you are Greek or a foreigner. For us, the cry of a baby and the joy of the mother is the same no matter where they are from.” But human rights lawyer Electra Leda Koutra, who worked on the research into birth experiences of refugee mothers, says vulnerable refugees need specific support. “A Greek woman will go home after birth. A refugee woman will be thrown back in a refugee camp or out on the streets [to] incredibly harsh, dangerous, unsanitary conditions. “Treating refugee women ‘the same as Greeks’ means speaking to them in Greek, giving them no option but male obstetricians, not translating for their medical instructions upon exit from hospital, and not taking into account the conditions they will face right afterwards. All this so-called equal treatment constitutes blatant gender-based violence and discrimination.” The difficulties faced by the women in pregnancy and birth are part of a wider challenge for all refugee families in Greece, that of surviving day to day with no idea of what the future will bring. Since borders closed further west within Europe earlier in 2016, tens of thousands of refugees have been stuck in overstretched Greece and Italy. The EU has promised to disperse 160,000 to other EU countries, only 8,162 people have been found a new home, figures from the European commission show. Anita Dullard is a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Greece. She told the Guardian that NGO’s are doing what they can to alleviate the situation for refugees stuck in camps over winter. “Although we are making improvements to the conditions in the camps...the accommodation is still substandard which causes frustration and mounting tensions in the camps. “The challenges in the long-term are to address housing alternatives to the camp as we move from an emergency response to a more long-term arrangement, one where they can live in a more dignified fashion, cook for themselves and access schools for their children. We recognise that people will be here for months if not years. “For pre and postnatal care, in camps where the Red Cross is present, we have midwives to make referrals into specialist care. We work on providing warm clothes, bedding, diapers and other essential material goods.” Campaigners hope that the refugee crisis may be an opportunity for change for Greece’s health authorities. Some local public health experts are already investigating new primary health care structures to deal with the changing demands on the system. “If we consider that 20% of the refugees are women and 70% are of reproductive age, with a fertility rate of 3–4%, it’s not a small number.” says Dr Agapios Terzidis, health crisis manager at the University of Athens and a paediatrician at the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Keelpno). Keelpno is assessing the needs of refugee and migrants girls and women of reproductive age in three camps as part of a scheme due to be rolled out nationwide in early 2017. “The Greek system is a very doctor-oriented system.” he says. “Midwives, community nurses etc play a secondary role. Now, we are trying to reform that. Long-term, it’s going to benefit the Greek health system as a whole.”"
2016-12-13T00:01:41Z,"Migrant workers in Qatar still at risk despite reforms, warns Amnesty","Workers building 2022 World Cup stadiums in Qatar will remain at risk of forced labour because of “meagre reforms” that “barely scratch the surface” of the Gulf state’s exploitation of migrant labour, Amnesty International UK has warned. A law change that comes into effect on Tuesday, which Qatar says guarantees greater flexibility, freedom and protection for workers, will not “significantly change the exploitative relationship between employers and workers”, said the rights group. The Gulf state is spending an estimated $200bn on new transport infrastructure, housing and sports facilities, including six stadiums designed by architects including Lord Foster and the late Zaha Hadid. Construction for the 2022 World Cup will peak in the coming two years, and Spanish champions FC Barcelona are due to play an exhibition match in Doha on Tuesday. But Qatar’s kafala system, which is used to recruit the majority of its workforce from countries including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, has prompted international outcry because it prevents workers from changing jobs or leaving the country without a permit. It is alleged to have resulted in modern-day slavery for some workers. Qatar said on Monday it was abolishing kafala and that it was “enormously grateful to the millions of workers who have come to Qatar to build our nation’s infrastructure during this period of rapid change”. But James Lynch, deputy director for global issues at Amnesty, said the new law “may get rid of the word ‘sponsorship’ but it leaves the same basic system intact”. “It is good that Qatar has accepted that its laws were fuelling abuse but these inadequate changes will continue to leave workers at the mercy of exploitative bosses,” he said. Amnesty has warned Fifa that it “cannot continue to remain shamefully ambivalent to the plight of workers in Qatar” and said FC Barcelona “should make clear to their hosts their desire to play in a human rights-friendly environment. Players and clubs cannot live in a bubble”. Lynch, a former British diplomat in Doha, said that in practice employers would still be able to stop migrant workers from leaving the country and that, by making it easier for employers to confiscate workers’ passports, the new law could make the situation worse. “The tragedy is that many workers think that this new law will be the end of their ordeal,” he said. In a statement, the government of Qatar said it “fundamentally rejects Amnesty International’s claims”. Issa bin Saad al-Jafali al-Nuaimi, a minister of labour, said Qatar was replacing “the kafala system with a modernised contract-based system that safeguards worker rights and increases job flexibility”. The ministry of administrative development, labour and social affairs said migrant workers would be free to leave the country if their employer allowed them and could appeal to a committee if their request was rejected. Workers who have completed fixed-term contracts would be free to move jobs, while those on rolling contracts would be free to move if they have completed five years of service. Employers who confiscate passports will be fined up to QAR25,000 (£5,400). However, Amnesty says the new law also makes holding passports legal if a worker requests it in writing and argues that this could be abused because “employers in Qatar enjoy a disproportionate level of influence and control over their employees”. “For a migrant worker, the prospect of being tied to one employer for up to five years, unable to change employer to secure better conditions or escape poor treatment or abuse, is not greatly different from their current position and will not significantly reduce the risk of coercion of workers by their employers,” said Lynch. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is due to make a judgment in March on whether the forced labour of migrant workers in Qatar’s construction industry warrants further investigation. Amnesty is now calling on the Qatari authorities to abolish the exit permit system, prohibit all passport confiscation and ensure that workers can change jobs without requiring the permission of their employer. Al-Nuaimi said: “We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action.”"
2016-07-26T17:23:00Z,US partners with Costa Rica to protect Central American refugees,"Costa Rica will offer temporary protection to refugees fleeing Central America for the US, the Obama administration announced on Tuesday, following an admission by officials of its failure to address the surge in refugees fleeing violence, rape and kidnappings. “Our current efforts to date have been insufficient to address the number of people who may have legitimate refugee claims,” said Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser, in a press call on Tuesday morning. Central Americans from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have fled their countries in their thousands. As violence in the Northern Triangle spiked in 2015, the number of asylum seekers from these countries rose to more than 110,000 – a fivefold increase from 2012. Most are seeking refuge in Mexico and the United States. Most are fleeing violence inflicted on their communities by brutal gangs who regularly target civilians, raping, killing and kidnapping them in exchange for exorbitant ransom payments. To address the needs of those who urgently need protection, the administration is partnering with Costa Rica, as well as the United Nations, which will help identify the most vulnerable people in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. “By themselves, today’s actions will not solve this challenge, but are steps in the right direction and are a further example of the United States’ commitment to resolve the situation,” said Anne Richards, the state department’s assistant secretary for the bureau of population, refugees and migration. Richards said Costa Rica was aiming to host 200 individuals at a time for six-month periods under the new protection transfer agreement (PTA). Only those who have been prescreened by state department officials in their countries of origin will be eligible for travel to Costa Rica. People who travel to the country on their own will not be accepted into the program. Those transferred to Costa Rica will undergo refugee processing before being resettled to the US or another country, but it was not clear what would happen if they could not be relocated within six months. Pope said the partnership: “is really to address those who are so vulnerable that there is no option for them to remain in the region while their applications are processed.” The Central American minors program is being expanded to extend eligibility for the program to certain qualified family members. This comes after more than 9,500 applications were filed for the program, most of those in the past nine months, said Alejandro Mayorkas, deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. The following people who accompany a qualified child who is aged 21 or under and not married may now be considered for the program: siblings older than 21 who have a lawfully present parent in the US; biological parents who have been in the origin country with the child; and caregivers who are related to a parent lawfully present in the US. As part of the expansion, officials also highlighted an agreement reached between Barack Obama and the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, last Friday to increase Mexico’s capacity to process asylum claims. Earlier this month, both countries agreed to improve access to asylum for Central Americans fleeing violence during a two-day meeting hosted by the UN refugee agency. Immigrants’ rights groups, however, were skeptical that the expansion could meet the high demand for asylum. Greg Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), said the group was pleased the administration was directing more resources to refugees, but was concerned the plan still left gaps in protection for vulnerable groups. Chen said the expansion did not appear to address individuals who were already in the US and had legitimate claims for protection. “That policy of aggressive enforcement, aggressive detention and removal of these asylum seekers from Central America is in contradiction with efforts to provide real protection to these individuals,” Chen said. Maureen Meyer, senior associate for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, was also concerned that the expansion still would not affect people who had to flee their home countries immediately and could not wait for the prescreening interviews by US state department officials. “What do you do in those situations where someone quite literally made a decision one day to the next based on threats or aggression or something that may have happened to them or their family members?” Meyers said. “They’re not going to want to wait around to get an appointment.” But Meyer said the announcement was “a very important step in the right direction” because it is the administration acknowledging the flow of people from Latin America includes potential refugees, not just economic migrants. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, introduced the plan to expand the Central American refugees program in January, but Tuesday’s announcement specifies some of the measures hinted at in his announcement, which came with the news that 21,469 undocumented children and families from Central America were detained at the US border in the last three months of 2015, a surge that echoed the migrant crisis of 2014. “We can both maintain the highest security standards and live up to our best traditions as Americans by welcoming those in need of help to our great country,” Kerry said in January. “That is who we are. That is what we do. That is how we wrote our history. That’s how we became who we are. And we dare not turn our backs on future people, generations seeking the same set of opportunities. We have the ability to protect ourselves even as we remain a country that welcomes migration.” Brian Hansford, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said: “UNHCR warmly welcomes today’s announcement as an important step in the right direction. We have expressed continued concern about the situation in Central America and today’s announcement puts forward a solid foundation for a regional response. UNHCR looks forward to continuing to work with all governments and civil society partners in the region to address the pressing humanitarian challenge.”"
2016-07-28T14:50:41Z,Campaign launched to discourage refugees from heading to Europe,"Italy and a refugee rights group are turning to Facebook and Twitter as part of a new social media campaign to try to dissuade African refugees from making the treacherous journey to Europe over the Mediterranean. An estimated 3,000 people have been killed this year while attempting to reach Italy’s southern shore, while 60% of refugees had their applications rejected last year because they were not deemed by authorities to be “true refugees” fleeing war. Aware Migrants, the new campaign, features powerful video testimonials from refugees who have made it to Italy but endured physical and sexual abuse from people traffickers and others along the way. It ought to serve as a kind of “message in a bottle” thrown into cyberspace, said the interior minister, Angelino Alfano. The group will also be taking out radio advertising. “We pride ourselves on all of those feeling war and will not stop them from coming. But we cannot welcome everyone,” he said. Initially, the vast majority of refugees heading for Italy were from war-stricken Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea. But this year, people have also been arriving from Nigeria, Gambia, Mali, Ethiopia, Sudan and Ghana. “Migration is a decision often based on false expectations: many migrants leave their home without a concrete project of precise idea of the socioeconomic and political situation of their country of destination,” said Aware Migrants. The campaign, estimated at about €1.5m (£1.3m) – paid for by the interior ministry – is aimed mostly at refugees from sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom are not necessarily fleeing war but are trying to escape abject poverty in search of opportunities in Europe. Officials at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), who are helping to lead the campaign, said they hoped the views of refugees who had survived the journey were breaking an important and dangerous taboo. Most migrants, said Federico Soda, who heads coordination efforts at IOM, did not tell families back home about the hardships they have endured once they got to Europe. “We hope to inform this choice of whether to go,” said Soda. In one video, a man named Tchamba tells of his initial refusal to step into an obviously unseaworthy vessel before he crossed the Mediterranean, only to be told by smugglers that he would be left for dead on the beach if he did not agree. “We had no choice. I held my baby and cried,” he said. The traffickers, he said, did not care whether anyone lived or died. In another testimonial, a woman describes being bought out of a Libyan prison and then threatened with rape. The video messages, which will be aired on television in 15 countries, are subtitled in English, and are also available in Italian and Arabic. The campaign is the latest of several attempts by Italy to convince fewer refugees to make the journey, with others including a deportation and relocation programme. Matteo Renzi, Italy’s prime minister, has insisted Italy and all of Europe had a humanitarian duty to protect people making the journey. But Renzi – like most European leaders – is keen to show he is taking steps to differentiate between refugees who are fleeing war, and those who are seeking a better life and economic opportunities. IOM’s involvement, as one of the main refugee rights groups that has called for better treatment of those choosing to make the journey, represents a strong humanitarian interest in the project."
2016-12-17T08:00:16Z,Labour of love: the volunteers helping fellow refugees give birth,"Bouncing a chattering toddler on her knee, a patterned headscarf framing her broad smile, Safa shows few signs of how difficult her life has been. But as she describes the past five years, her hand moves instinctively to her pregnant stomach. In 2012, Safa and her husband, both in their late 20s, were living in Aleppo when a blast destroyed their home, injuring him and leaving them with nothing. The young couple travelled by bus to Lebanon where, for six months, they shared a room and one toilet with 10 other people. Surviving on a tiny stipend from the UN, they were eventually given their own room – “about the size of this”, she says, gesturing to a small table – in return for collecting all the rubbish in the block. It was there that she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, now 18 months old. “We were treated like animals,” she says. It was in Lebanon that the new family learned they would become three of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the British government has agreed to take through the vulnerable persons relocation scheme. Of the news that they would be flown to Leeds, Safa recalls simply, “It was wonderful, like a dream.” She became pregnant again soon after arriving in the UK, something that meant her life might still be at risk. Asylum-seeking and refugee women currently account for 14% of all maternal deaths in the UK (despite comprising only 0.5% of the population) according to the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries. Navigating the British health service without the language or confidence to ask the right questions, their interaction with maternity services can be too little or come too late, with complications going undetected. Asylum-seeking and refugee women are statistically more likely to experience late miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. In the UK, Safa faced the prospect of giving birth without anyone she knew in the room. “My husband will be looking after her,” she explains, whispering Arabic into her daughter’s ear. “And we are alone here – we had to leave all our friends and family in Aleppo.” Thanks to a newly revived befriender scheme run by the Refugee Council, Safa will not be alone. Last week, she was introduced to Fatoma, a bustling, maternal woman in a denim maxi dress and peach headscarf who scoops Safa’s daughter up and tickles her. Fatoma fled the civil war in Sudan 10 years ago, arriving in Leeds; she has volunteered to support Safa through her pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood. She grins at her new friend: “I met her for the first time on Tuesday, and she has already asked me to be at the hospital during her labour.” Fatoma understands what it is like to be alone in a country you do not understand, and which often does not understand you. When she gave birth to her daughter six years ago, it was “terrifying, confusing and lonely”, she says, wiping away a tear. I meet Safa and Fatoma in a municipal office space in Leeds. They are among a small group of mothers (Sudanese, Syrian, Russian, Bolivian) who sit and trade stories, passing their babies between them. Each experienced a terrifying flight from her home country. Now, through the Refugee Council, each of them has volunteered to support another pregnant woman. “These are some of the most marginalised women in our country,” says Rose McCarthy, volunteer coordinator for the scheme, which started in 2011 and is currently relaunching with a focus on Syrian women. “But they believe no one should have to give birth in this country afraid and alone.” With Fatoma translating her Arabic, Safa explains: “I don’t yet speak English, so when I have the baby I want someone with me I can trust and speak to in my own language.” She looks shyly at Fatoma. “I feel so much better already, knowing that she will be there.” *** When Luisa arrived in this country from Bolivia in 2009, she spoke barely a word of English. Knowing no one, she spent two years determinedly learning the language by watching TV. When she became pregnant a few months later, it was a shock. “She was my first baby, so I didn’t know very much about being pregnant, or about labour,” she says. “I didn’t even have a GP. And I didn’t know about midwives – they don’t exist where I come from.” When she gave birth, “It was horrible – I felt like I was being torn apart.” At home in Chuquisaca, she was a law student. She was organising demonstrations against the government when, in 2008, there were violent clashes between supporters and opponents of President Evo Morales. Her friends began to disappear and her mother, fearing her daughter would be next, sent her to the UK. After her baby, also called Luisa, was born, the two were briefly sent to a detention centre, before being moved from London to Leeds. “I became paranoid,” Luisa says. “I had an appointment at the Home Office, but no money to get there. I went to the Refugee Council offices to ask for emergency funds, but I’d already received some and they said no. I was desperate. I had no money to feed my daughter, so I left her there in the offices, making sure she was safe. Then I walked out and tried to kill myself.” She took an overdose of sleeping pills. Meanwhile, staff at the Refugee Council had found her telephone number, called her and kept her talking until an ambulance arrived. When she was discharged from hospital, Luisa was referred to the befriender scheme as a new mother in need. At the charity’s offices, Luisa had her first meeting with her volunteer befriender, Dasha. “I didn’t want to know at first,” Luisa admits. “For a long time, I’d only really interacted with people who sat behind desks, asking lots of questions I didn’t feel comfortable answering. I felt everyone was pitying me, and I can’t stand pity. But Dasha was really funny, and really persistent. If I cancelled a plan to meet up, she might turn up on my doorstep. She worked in a cafe and would bring cake. For the first time since I arrived in this country, she talked to me as an equal, not an inferior.” Dasha, whose family claimed asylum in the UK from Russia 15 years ago, took Luisa to playgroups. Together, the women joined self-esteem classes provided by students from Leeds University in collaboration with the Refugee Council. “She even bought me a Christmas present,” Luisa says with a smile. One day, Dasha dropped by Luisa’s flat and found her young daughter falling in and out of consciousness. “Luisa didn’t know what to do,” Dasha remembers. “There was deep snow outside but I told her we had to get to the hospital.” She bundled the three of them into a taxi and they rushed to A&amp;E. “The doctors were talking about terrifying possibilities, and making Luisa sign all sorts of forms,” Dasha tells me. “Everything turned out fine, but sometimes you just need a friend, someone who knows how the system works, someone who can explain and hold your hand, who can pack an overnight bag and bring snacks for you.” *** There are many reasons why migrant women might fail to engage with health services. Like Luisa, their isolation might mean they simply do not know about them. Others fear being charged for services they cannot afford: undocumented women can be charged up to £9,000 for giving birth in this country; last month’s government proposal that patients could be required to bring two forms of identification to hospital to alleviate so-called “health tourism”, has fuelled further fears. Pregnant refugees often need urgent care. They are likely to have arrived in this country malnourished, with conditions ranging from tuberculosis and malaria to HIV. Plus, as Dasha says, “They come here to escape from danger – how could they not be psychologically damaged, too?” Yet those who do access help often report poor experiences: no interpreters, or midwives and other maternity workers who do not understand their cultural and health needs. In Leeds, any English-speaking, asylum-seeking and refugee mothers can apply to be befrienders. Successful applicants undergo four training sessions, which cover listening and empowerment skills, as well as understanding how health and maternity care differs across cultures. In 2011, 74 women speaking 30 different languages were recruited as volunteers and matched with 180 women in Leeds, referred by midwives, children’s centres and community refugee organisations. Research carried out after the first year showed that every woman involved reported a higher sense of wellbeing. Funding for the scheme ended in 2014 – but three months ago, McCarthy managed to revive the programme, specifically to support the 419 Syrians who have been resettled in the Yorkshire and Humberside region since October 2015. Her old volunteers have flooded back, along with new ones. Since September, McCarthy has recruited and trained 40 volunteers. The first three befriending pairs have already been matched. With 1,340 Syrians expected to settle in the region over the next two to three years, “there is a big appetite for it”, she says. *** When Alia arrived in the UK this year, she had to hide the fact that she was more than eight months pregnant: she feared being banned from the flight. She was fleeing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan (where an estimated 480,000 people have now been killed), to meet her husband, who had already made the arduous journey and settled in Leeds. “I took her to the local children’s centres, and to antenatal classes,” says Muna, a volunteer befriender, and another Darfur refugee, who met Alia within days of her arrival. Then one evening her phone rang. “Her husband was crying,” Muna remembers. “He said: ‘We’re at the hospital and they say there is an infection. The baby is in danger. We need an emergency caesarean but Alia won’t consent.’” While Muna tells their story, Alia quietly nurses her five-month-old son, Sammy. “I was scared,” she says softly, with Muna as her translator. “Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies.” “So I ran,” says Muna. “I dropped everything and ran all the way to the hospital. I didn’t see the cars. Everything was a blur.” This wasn’t just any running: Muna had competed in the 800m for Sudan in the 2008 Olympic Games. Minutes later, she was at Alia’s bedside. “I knew nothing about caesareans. I was terrified,” she says. “But I held her hand and I said: ‘You must do this and I will go in with you. I will talk to you while they do it, and you can talk to me, and the baby will be fine.’” The two women went into theatre together. Moments later, Sammy was born, a greenish blue, but alive. “When it was over, I cried,” says Muna, “I could stop being brave for her. Afterwards, I was with her every day, I helped her with breastfeeding, how to bathe the baby – I am like her second mum.” Officially, volunteer befrienders are only expected to give up three hours of their time a week, and are under no obligation to attend the birth itself. Often, however, three hours turn into much more, and partnerships turn into lifelong friendships. Many befriended women end up as volunteers themselves. Luisa, for example, has become a vocal campaigner for the scheme. “Last week I chaired a debate,” she says, smiling. “I’ve spoken in parliament, in conferences and schools. I even went to Glastonbury festival to talk.” Other women have gone on to find paid jobs after volunteering. “There’s nothing like this work,” Dasha says. “It gives you such self-confidence, a feeling of doing good.” She now works for the council, providing information about housing support. As midwives become increasingly overstretched, McCarthy hopes that similar schemes could be introduced across the UK. “Befrienders make the most enormous difference,” she says. “They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others.” I leave the group of women chatting and giggling, and cooing over Sammy, who is now sleeping soundly. One more healthy baby, and a life saved by a group of ordinary, extraordinary women."

Others fear being charged for services they cannot afford: undocumented women can be charged up to £9,000 for giving birth in this country; last month’s government proposal that patients could be required to bring two forms of identification to hospital to alleviate so-called “health tourism”, has fuelled further fears. Pregnant refugees often need urgent care. They are likely to have arrived in this country malnourished, with conditions ranging from tuberculosis and malaria to HIV. Plus, as Dasha says, “They come here to escape from danger – how could they not be psychologically damaged, too?” Yet those who do access help often report poor experiences: no interpreters, or midwives and other maternity workers who do not understand their cultural and health needs. In Leeds, any English-speaking, asylum-seeking and refugee mothers can apply to be befrienders. Successful applicants undergo four training sessions, which cover listening and empowerment skills, as well as understanding how health and maternity care differs across cultures. In 2011, 74 women speaking 30 different languages were recruited as volunteers and matched with 180 women in Leeds, referred by midwives, children’s centres and community refugee organisations. Research carried out after the first year showed that every woman involved reported a higher sense of wellbeing. Funding for the scheme ended in 2014 – but three months ago, McCarthy managed to revive the programme, specifically to support the 419 Syrians who have been resettled in the Yorkshire and Humberside region since October 2015. Her old volunteers have flooded back, along with new ones. Since September, McCarthy has recruited and trained 40 volunteers. The first three befriending pairs have already been matched. With 1,340 Syrians expected to settle in the region over the next two to three years, “there is a big appetite for it”, she says. *** When Alia arrived in the UK this year, she had to hide the fact that she was more than eight months pregnant: she feared being banned from the flight. She was fleeing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan (where an estimated 480,000 people have now been killed), to meet her husband, who had already made the arduous journey and settled in Leeds. “I took her to the local children’s centres, and to antenatal classes,” says Muna, a volunteer befriender, and another Darfur refugee, who met Alia within days of her arrival. Then one evening her phone rang. “Her husband was crying,” Muna remembers. “He said: ‘We’re at the hospital and they say there is an infection. The baby is in danger. We need an emergency caesarean but Alia won’t consent.’” While Muna tells their story, Alia quietly nurses her five-month-old son, Sammy. “I was scared,” she says softly, with Muna as her translator. “Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies.” “So I ran,” says Muna. “I dropped everything and ran all the way to the hospital. I didn’t see the cars. Everything was a blur.” This wasn’t just any running: Muna had competed in the 800m for Sudan in the 2008 Olympic Games. Minutes later, she was at Alia’s bedside. “I knew nothing about caesareans. I was terrified,” she says. “But I held her hand and I said: ‘You must do this and I will go in with you. I will talk to you while they do it, and you can talk to me, and the baby will be fine.’” The two women went into theatre together. Moments later, Sammy was born, a greenish blue, but alive. “When it was over, I cried,” says Muna, “I could stop being brave for her. Afterwards, I was with her every day, I helped her with breastfeeding, how to bathe the baby – I am like her second mum.” Officially, volunteer befrienders are only expected to give up three hours of their time a week, and are under no obligation to attend the birth itself. Often, however, three hours turn into much more, and partnerships turn into lifelong friendships. Many befriended women end up as volunteers themselves. Luisa, for example, has become a vocal campaigner for the scheme. “Last week I chaired a debate,” she says, smiling. “I’ve spoken in parliament, in conferences and schools. I even went to Glastonbury festival to talk.” Other women have gone on to find paid jobs after volunteering. “There’s nothing like this work,” Dasha says. “It gives you such self-confidence, a feeling of doing good.” She now works for the council, providing information about housing support. As midwives become increasingly overstretched, McCarthy hopes that similar schemes could be introduced across the UK. “Befrienders make the most enormous difference,” she says. “They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others.” I leave the group of women chatting and giggling, and cooing over Sammy, who is now sleeping soundly. One more healthy baby, and a life saved by a group of ordinary, extraordinary women."
2016-05-20T15:48:31Z,Syrian refugee wins appeal against forced return to Turkey,"The EU-Turkey migration deal has been thrown further into chaos after an independent authority examining appeals claims in Greece ruled against sending a Syrian refugee back to Turkey, potentially creating a precedent for thousands of other similar cases. In a landmark case, the appeals committee upheld the appeal of an asylum seeker who had been one of the first Syrians listed for deportation under the terms of the EU-Turkey deal. In a document seen by the Guardian, a three-person appeals tribunal in Lesbos said Turkey would not give Syrian refugees the rights they were owed under international treaties and therefore overturned the applicant’s deportation order by a verdict of two to one. The case will now be re-assessed from scratch. The committee’s conclusion stated: “The committee has judged that the temporary protection which could be offered by Turkey to the applicant, as a Syrian citizen, does not offer him rights equivalent to those required by the Geneva convention.” The decision undermines the legal and practical basis for the EU-Turkey deal, which European leaders had hoped would deter refugees from sailing to Europe by ensuring the swift deportation of most people landing on the Greek islands. After signing the deal on 18 March, EU officials claimed these deportations would be legally justified on the basis that Turkey respects refugee rights. But the EU’s executive has little control over Greek asylum protocols. The committee rejected the logic of the EU-Turkey deal, citing some of the EU’s own previous directives as explanations for their decision. While nearly 400 other asylum seekers have been returned to Turkey under the terms of the deal, no one of Syrian nationality had been sent back against their will – making Friday’s decision a watershed moment. “At its very first test, the EU-Turkey deal crumbles,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s deputy Europe director. The Greek government, which played no part in the independent decision, admitted the judgment had created “a very difficult situation”. Greece’s deputy minister in charge of migration policy, Yannis Mouzalas, said by phone from Brussels: “I have only just learned of the decision by the appeals committee and I have to be in Greece to study it. They are, as you know, independent committees so it is very difficult for me to say anything – but if they think this way, we will have a very difficult situation.” Such a decision goes against all the directives of the UN and UNHCR, Mouzalas claimed. “Really I don’t know how they arrived at it.” UNHCR offered no immediate response, but has previously criticised the EU-Turkey deal, and resolved to play no part in it. Greek media said it would be only a matter of time before the “bombshell” decision had the snowball effect of triggering an avalanche of similar asylum requests by other refugees, especially Syrians, detained on far-flung Aegean islands. Some 174 claims have been examined by appeals committees made up of asylum experts, lawyers and officials in Lesbos so far, with 100 being upheld, according to the Greek daily Kathimerini. Government figures released on Friday showed 8,592 migrants and refugees were currently being held on the islands, often in squalid conditions. The increased prospect of being allowed to stay in Greece, rather than being returned to Syria, could also spark a renewed wave of migration from Turkey. Deterred by the deal and by increased Turkish border protection, migrant numbers have dwindled significantly since the deal was announced. Human rights groups were quick to welcome the news. “We’ve always said Turkey is not a safe country for refugees because it has not fully signed up to the Geneva convention and to the social and judicial status of refugees, especially those who are not Syrians,” said Wenzel Michalski, who as Germany director of Human Rights Watch watched the first forced returns of migrants from Lesbos to Turkey in April. Pledges by Turkey to improve labour market regulations by facilitating work permits for refugees had not been delivered, nor had promises to install refugee children in the education system, he said. Even worse was evidence of push-backs at the Turkish-Syrian border where would-be refugees had been deliberately shot at and killed – claims denied by the Turkish government. “There are still lots of children who work instead of going to school and even worse, we still don’t really know about the fate of those deported so far, as NGOs and journalists have been denied access to refugee camps and the first thing Turkish authorities did was to confiscate their smartphones,” he said from Berlin. “We have to say: ‘Greece, thank you,’ because this is a wonderful move.”"
2016-09-28T18:25:16Z,Labour conference: shadow cabinet split over immigration,"A split within the shadow cabinet has emerged over the issue of immigration after Jeremy Corbyn used his keynote speech to the Labour party conference to suggest there was no need for further controls on the movement of people. The party leader used his speech in Liverpool to mount a forceful defence of the contribution made by immigrants. Some of his allies in the shadow cabinet, including Angela Rayner, Barry Gardiner, Andy Burnham and Emily Thornberry all struck a different tone from the party leader by suggesting there may be a case for tighter controls following the vote to leave the EU. Burnham declared his intention to resign as shadow home secretary to spend more time on his mayoral campaign in Greater Manchester and used his conference speech to warn that change was needed on immigration. “Labour must face up fully to this fact: millions of our lifelong supporters voted to leave the EU and voted for change on immigration,” he said. There were reports last night that Shami Chakrabarti could be joining the shadow cabinet as attorney general but a Labour source said nothing had been decided. Corbyn’s team had briefed overnight that in his speech he would talk about the benefits of immigration and not seek greater controls. The party leader repeated in a morning BBC interview that he did not see a need to bring down the level of immigration and would tackle concerns of voters with a “migrant impact fund” to ease the pressure on public services in affected areas. Rayner, the shadow education secretary, told the BBC there must be greater restrictions on immigration and described the current system as chaos. “We have to have controls on immigration, that’s quite clear,” she told BBC News. “You have to know who is coming in to your country and who is leaving your country. We have got to make sure that our economic situation is good for everybody because immigration is a good thing for us, but what undermines [that] is when people feel that it is unvetted and that we are not able to deal with the issues and the concerns that people have around that.” Meanwhile, Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and one of Corbyn’s strongest supporters, said there was a “legitimate debate across the party and different areas have different responses”. The senior MP, who will be in charge of Labour’s policy on Brexit, said her preference would be for Britain to remain in the single market, which is likely to mean accepting unfettered free movement, but she added: “I have been talking to people about how one could control immigration across the UK. It’s in your armoury.” Gardiner, the shadow energy and trade secretary, was another to say there should be “quality controls on all migration into this country because what the British people want is to know is that if people are coming into the UK it’s going to benefit their lives and not just the people that are coming”. Former frontbenchers also expressed disquiet. Emma Reynolds, the former shadow communities secretary, said: “The idea that there isn’t any space between unequivocal support for free movement and Ukip’s divisive position is plainly wrong.” Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary, said Labour must not be “paralysed from debating immigration reform either – or our tin ear to the concerns of the country will stop others listening to our case for helping refugees”, while former shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves caused controversy on Tuesday by suggesting the UK could “explode” if concerns about immigration were ignored. Despite the discontent among many Labour MPs about the party’s policy, Corbyn stuck firmly to his arguments in his conference speech, where he said migration did not depress wages unless there was undercutting by unscrupulous employers. He said people’s concerns should be allayed by extra government funding to invest in public services where there is particular pressure from a higher population. “It isn’t migrants that drive down wages, it’s exploitative employers and the politicians who deregulate the labour market and rip up trade union rights,” he said. “It isn’t migrants who put a strain on our NHS, it only keeps going because of the migrant nurses and doctors who come here filling the gaps left by politicians who have failed to invest in training. “It isn’t migrants that have caused a housing crisis; it’s a Tory government that has failed to build homes.” Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4, he said he understood “the problems that can come in some areas”, which is why he would create a “migrant impact fund” to ease pressure on public services. “Migrants that have come to this country make an enormous contribution to it. Our conference understands that and Tom Watson put that case very well about the work that migrants have done in the NHS and education and other industries.” Pointing out that numbers vary from year to year, Corbyn said there were many industries such as farming that depended on migrant labour. Asked if people should stop worrying about immigration, he said: “We have to allay people’s concerns about the impact ... and recognise the huge contribution made to our economy and the numbers of people working in the NHS that are pretty crucial to the survival of the NHS.” He suggested that the UK should continue to accept free movement from the EU, while maintaining access to the single market on the same basis as other member states."
2016-07-23T23:06:13Z,Child migrants in Sicily must overcome one last obstacle – the mafia,"The diminutive figures were lined up outside Catania’s central station. There were seven in all, aged between 15 and 17. They had recently escaped from the massive government-run migrant reception centres inland or further along the Sicilian coast. Now they were alone, waiting for the city’s matrix of organised criminals to take them north. “We have nowhere to go, we feel safer outside on our own than in the camps,” said Mohammed Asante, 17, from Ghana. Thousands of unaccompanied minors have disappeared from Catania, mostly through smuggling networks. It is a lucrative trade, so it should come as no surprise that Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mafia, may be exploiting this latest market in human suffering. Anti-mafia prosecutors have revealed to the Observer that they are currently investigating the Italian government’s network of official homes for unaccompanied minors, believing that child refugees are being targeted in the very places they should be protected. They also claim to have uncovered widespread corruption, involving alleged kickbacks and bribes to secure lucrative public contracts to run migrant camps. According to prosecutors, there is also a British connection to the smuggling rings that are targeting migrants. Money has been wired directly to criminals based in London from refugees inside Italian reception centres. This week the House of Lords will publish a parliamentary report into Europe’s treatment of unaccompanied minors. As the surge of refugees from the most troubled regions of the world shows no sign of letting up, concern is mounting that children arriving in Sicily are being denied basic services. Money destined for them is, investigators claim, being taken to line the pockets of corrupt officials. Sexual exploitation is a genuine fear, say prosecutors, while teenagers from Africa and the Middle East are being forced to toil for little or no pay in harsh conditions in the fields around Catania. The mafia’s involvement may also offer an explanation into one of the enduring mysteries of Europe’s migrant crisis: how have so many of its child refugees vanished without trace? Most of the unaccompanied minors in Catania rarely seem to leave the patch of grass near the station, sitting quietly throughout the stupefying afternoon heat, occasionally washing in the fountain dedicated to the ancient Roman goddess Proserpina. “We are ‘bambinos’, but we had to leave the official camp because it was too full and there was too much fighting inside, we couldn’t defend ourselves,” said Ibrahim Jallow, 17, from Banjul in the Gambia. As he spoke, Jallow glanced towards the smugglers staring back from along Via Don Luigi Sturzo. Abdelfetah, an Eritrean cultural mediator in Catania, estimates the smugglers have taken 1,000 children from Eritrea alone from the city over the past three years. He has no idea of their fate. “If they go missing, no one knows,” he said. Latest figures suggest that more than 5,000 refugee children vanished without trace after arriving in Italy last year and registering with the authorities. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an Eritrean police informant said Catania’s smuggling operations were organised by a mixture of Eritreans, Egyptians and Somalis. But everyone in Catania knows that Cosa Nostra retains overall control of the city’s underworld. “Nothing happens here without the mafia,” said Abdelfetah. An indication of their grip on the city is the volume of Catanian businesses paying the pizzo – protection money averaging around £420 per month for an ordinary bar. Only 140 firms out of an estimated 10,000 in the city officially refuse to pay protection. “It’s a very severe problem, the mafia are everywhere,” said Salvo Fabio of Adiopizzo, a coalition of companies which defies the mafia by refusing to pay the tariff. The Observer spoke to one migrant smuggler, a regular at the train station, as he returned home through the labyrinthine lanes of San Berillo, an inner-city mafia stronghold where runners peddle their drugs and the city’s Nigerian population control the city’s prostitution. He refused to give his name. But when asked if Cosa Nostra was profiting from unaccompanied minors, he said: “Of course. We have an agreement, like the Nigerians and their women.” As a youthful exodus from troubled African states continues, Catania is currently experiencing a surge in the arrival of child refugees. Overnight on 13 July, the Observer witnessed at least 20 new children, mainly from Asmara in Eritrea, arrive at the fountain. Some were as young as 12. As the heat drained from the city’s black streets, hewn out of lava from nearby Mount Etna, the stream of new arrivals kept coming. Three Eritreans, aged 16, had escaped from an official migrant reception camp at Port Augusta and walked 25 miles up the coast. One shy Somali boy had fled a camp north of Catania. Hamsa, aged 12, was now sitting on his own, wondering what to do next. The Eritrean informant who gave testimony to Operation Glauco, the Italian police initiative attempting to disrupt smuggling networks, said: “The numbers of children are increasing, their ages are getting younger, and at the same time the crime around them more organised. “We are seeing kids being taken out of the camps, or they get scared of living with adults and leave. Criminals involved in the smuggling are also believed to be becoming increasingly involved in other parts of the chain, they are working inside the reception centres.” Some are working in places such as the government-funded Cara di Mineo camp. Twenty five miles inland from Catania, Cara di Mineo is an isolated former US army camp in a sweeping valley dotted with orange groves. Beyond its razor-wire perimeter, up to 4,000 migrants are crammed inside rows of terra-cotta houses. This is Europe’s largest migrant reception centre. The anti-mafia team in Catania is investigating if the actual numbers of refugees inside the centre have been deliberately inflated to allow officials to pocket higher contributions from the government. Firms looking after Italy’s wave of migrants receive £30 a day for each adult and £62 for a child. The total annual budget for Mineo is about £70m. “We suspect they try to spend a very small part on the migrant and the biggest part for them, this is the phenomenon,” said Andrea Bonomo, another member of Catania’s anti-mafia unit. The truth is that no one seems sure how many migrants are even inside the camp. In theory children should not be in the camp at all, but the Observer has established that minors are being smuggled in illegally. Children held there describe intense overcrowding and cramped rooms holding five to six. Some live inside the remote facility for as long as 18 months, usually finding it a wretched experience. The centre has been plagued with allegations of prostitution, drug use and violence. One unaccompanied 17-year-old, Diaby Aldemar, claimed to have spent a year inside Cara di Mineo before escaping due to violence and “bad” conditions. An Afghan teenager outside the camp called Abdul showed an identity card revealing he was 17. “I have spent two years in there already, waiting, but nothing has happened to my claim.” Many unaccompanied minors described smugglers taking them inside the centre and subsequently arranging for them to be taken north to countries such as Britain and Germany. Many choose to escape. Most of the children outside Catania’s station had fled from Cara di Mineo, paying illegal minicabs parked at the camp £3.50 to take them to the city. Keita Saka, 17, from Bamako, Mali, spent eight months in the camp before fleeing, and said that smugglers approached him many times while he was there. “They ask where I want to go, England, Germany, Sweden. They said they can arrange from the inside.” There is reason to suspect that Cara di Mineo has become in effect an open-air hub for smugglers, operating with the blessing of the mafia; a massive holding pen from where criminals take orders for human traffic. Some of those orders come directly from the UK. Rocco Liguori, another anti-mafia prosecutor whose profession entails that he negotiates Catania’s streets in bulletproof vehicles, revealed they had been in contact with the British police and had uncovered proof that refugees stranded in Cara di Mineo were wiring money to individuals in Britain. “We have evidence of smuggling towards the UK. We have collaborated with the British authorities. We have information about people receiving money in London from Cara di Mineo. The problem is about minors, thousands disappear. We used to think what are they doing with these minors? But in reality it seems many are just trying to reach their families in northern Europe,” he said. Bonomo added: “We have evidence of minors paying money to escape, this includes to the UK. We are investigating if they are being exploited through labour and sexually.” Those held in Cara di Mineo describe being deprived of vital services. Six senior officials connected to the camp have been told they are under investigation for their alleged roles in denying asylum seekers key services. Akim Zakariyahu, 17, of Ivory Coast, says he spent months inside the camp: “They sometimes never gave us food and we hardly got any aqua [water],” he said. “Hardly enough to survive on. They use us only for business.” Others allege that the authorities kept the children’s daily state allowance of £1.70 for weeks on end or withheld a proportion. “They keep the money, instead of 100% they keep 25%,” said his friend Diaby Aldemar, 16, from Mali. Lucia Borghi works for the refugee charity Borderline Sicilia. She said that the treatment given to children arriving in Sicily was so poor that their health actually deteriorated after they reached supposed sanctuary following a treacherous Mediterranean crossing. “They escaped terrible hardship, made horrendous journeys across the sea, and yet they look better when they arrive than they do after two years in Italy,” she said. The private company that runs Cara di Mineo has in the past denied all allegations regarding conditions at the centre, stating that law and order is strictly upheld and that the migrants are treated well. The mafia’s exploitation of the migrant crisis extends far beyond Sicily. Investigations have linked the corruption in Cara di Mineo to Mafia Capitale, the recent scandal when crime syndicate involvement in the administration of Rome was exposed. It is alleged that organised crime infiltrated public-service contracts on a grand scale, including those relating to migrant reception centres. One notorious underworld figure, Salvatore Buzzi, ran a vast cooperative that provided food and language courses for migrants and his combined business was said to be worth £30m. In a wiretap recording, Buzzi, who has reportedly denied the allegations, is caught admitting: “Do you know how much we earn off migrants? Drugs are less profitable.” Staring at the imposing mass of Mount Etna, Konate Akala from Nigeria could not stop shaking his head. The 17-year-old has been staying inside one of the official government camps for child refugees near the town of Giarre, 12 miles north of Catania, for three months and so far had watched 50 teenagers disappear. Another two had gone the night before. “A group of 15 Egyptian boys came about two months ago, first nine went, then another five. There’s just one left now.” The camp’s official capacity is 60 but it was holding 80. “They always leave without saying anything, people must be telling them not to say a word. People arrange travel for you – they don’t come to the camp, they arrange to meet elsewhere. Most people want to go to Germany, Sweden, Britain,” said Akala. Prosecutors in Catania have admitted that they are investigating a number of the camps over allegations that networks of smugglers are operating within them. Prosecutor Bonomo said: “They have a brother in Milan or Norway, Germany or Britain. The family wants the minor to reach relatives and so they pay. There are also investigations into exploitation of minors; there is a danger they are being exploited by criminal networks.” The children at Giarre describe being sent on week-long projects, where they were told to move crops to waiting trucks. “They tell us it’s school but there are no lessons. At the end we get a certificate in Italian we cannot read,” said Akala. For those stranded in such camps, a frequent complaint is that nothing happens. Many claim that no lawyers visit, no immigration documents are received or asylum applications organised. Joseph Mubundo, 17, from Conakry, Guinea, has been in Sicily for seven months but says his fingerprints have not even been taken by the authorities. He is tired of waiting. Soon, says Mubundo, he will follow the others and try his luck with the smugglers. “I might go to Catania, ask people. Why not leave? I am invisible already.” As Sicily struggles to cope with the tide of desperate migrants and the dark forces of Cosa Nostra, Joseph and hundreds of others like him may well become the next “clients” to earn the mafia a tidy profit. THE EGYPTIAN CONNECTION An Egyptian people-smuggler has emerged as one of the key contact figures for Italian mafia groups seeking to extend their arms-dealing networks. Fathi Abdelkader Mohamed Shalpy Garpua is believed to be the figure to whom the Sicilian mafia intended to sell firearms, in a transaction that shows Cosa Nostra is willing to work with criminal syndicates in north Africa. Intercepted phone conversations indicate that Garpua, from Port Said, was the intended recipient of assault rifles reactivated by the mafia in Sicily. Garpua is a central figure in a well-established criminal empire based in Alexandria, Egypt’s main smuggling centre. He is believed to be responsible for sending child refugees to Sicily and facilitating their journeys north to western Europe and probably the UK. Catania’s anti-mafia prosecutors describe Garpua as a man connected to a “large” criminal organisation and no stranger to trafficking. Even before the Libyan and Syria wars, which sparked the migration crisis, Italian wiretaps outlined his role in an Italo-Egyptian immigration racket stretching from north Africa to Italy. Police records show Garpua is also wanted for extortion. In May 2011 he is alleged to have kidnapped six child migrants from a refugee camp near Siracusa, south of Catania. Wiretaps reveal the abductions were intended as a message for families of migrants who had failed to pay for services provided by Cosa Nostra. MT"
2016-12-21T17:03:50Z,Home Office criticised for opaque child refugee transfer process,"Human Rights Watch has condemned the Home Office for its “non-transparent and arbitrary” process for transferring unaccompanied child refugees to the UK. In a scathing attack, the campaign group said the process was so ill-considered that the government had ended up separating siblings, in breach of the Dubs amendment to immigration laws, which pledged to give some unaccompanied children refuge in Britain. In the case of two boys from Ethiopia, a 12-year-old was transferred to the UK while his 15-year-old brother was left behind. In another case, Human Rights Watch said a boy and his half-sister were separated when the girl was reunited with an uncle, but the boy was not because he was not directly related to the adult. The group based its criticism on interviews with 41 unaccompanied child refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan in reception centres in France. The interviews took place between 5 and 16 December, the period directly before and after the Home Office announced on 9 December that it had stopped transfers from France. Human Rights Watch said children were being left in the dark on the process, leading to psychological distress and, in two cases, suicidal thoughts. It said: “Children said they did not have information about how and when they would learn the outcome in their cases, the selection criteria, what recourse, if any, they have if they are not accepted, and how they could follow up with the UK Home Office. “Several said they were so upset that they could not sleep or eat, and two said they thought of taking their own lives. A 17-year-old boy who had been detained in his home country, Ethiopia, and in Libya en route to France, said that he was desperate to join his aunt in the UK,” it said. The charity said the boy told them: “‘I am very lonely here … I am going to kill myself [if I cannot go].’” The group concluded that the transfer process for children lacked transparency and was arbitrary, hurting children’s mental health.The findings echo those of other charities, including Help Refugees, Safe Passage and Social Workers without Borders, who have said both the French and British governments were breaching children’s rights by not having a care plan for each child, as they would for a homeless British or French child. Minors being monitored by Social Workers without Borders in a reception centre in Taizé, near the Swiss border, have been refusing to eat because of the lack of information from the Home Office. Other volunteers working in Bruniquel, in the south of France, said two children who had refused to eat had been taken to hospital. They have since been returned to the reception centre. in the south-western French town of Biscarrosse, a group of Sudanese children demonstrated this week to show their anger at having their applications rejected without explanation. About 2,000 children were dispersed across France from the Calais camp at the end of October, all of whom expected that they would be eligible for transfer to the UK under the Dubs amendment or the Dublin regulation. The Dublin law allows unaccompanied minors who have family in another EU country to have their asylum considered in that country. The Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act allows the government to consider unaccompanied children who have no family for asylum in the UK. Human Rights Watch said it had found minors who appeared to qualify under the regulation – including a 16-year-old boy who has an uncle, aunt, and grandparents in the UK – still in France. It said the Home Office transfer criteria to implement the Dubs amendment were too strict and did not comply with its spirit. Last month, the Home Office was criticised after it announced new Dubs criteria that would stop many Eritrean, Afghan and Yemeni teenagers aged 13 or 14 from getting sanctuary in the UK. The new guidelines, issued to charities two weeks after the Calais camp was cleared, in effect barred those teenagers regardless of why they had left their home countries. The guidance said it would take under-13s of all nationalities, those deemed at high risk of sexual exploitation, and those who “are aged 15 or under and are of Sudanese or Syrian nationality” because people from those countries are already granted asylum in the UK in 75% of cases. Human Rights Watch said the Dubs criteria did not appear to have been correctly followed in all cases, including the separation of older siblings from younger ones who do qualify. It called for the Home Office to broaden its selection criteria and reminded it that the Dubs amendment was “intended as a humanitarian measure”. It also criticised the French government for abandoning normal safeguarding rules for children in the reception centres. It said that the children were being looked after “outside the regular child protection service” and that the children in the reception centres “have not had access to asylum procedures or the regular child protection system in France”. The Home Office has been contacted for comment."
2016-12-16T11:07:18Z,"Guardian and Observer readers raise over £500,000 for child refugees","Guardian and Observer readers have raised more than £500,000 in less than a week for charities supporting child refugees. The 2016 appeal is raising money for three charities working with young refugees and migrants based mainly in continental Europe and the UK: Help Refugees, Safe Passage and the Children’s Society. The charities praised the generosity of readers and said the contributions would make a huge difference to the lives of young people driven from their homes by war and persecution in Syria and elsewhere. Although the charities predominantly provide aid, care and advocacy in Europe, Help Refugees has contributed funds to Syria-based aid projects, including £20,000 towards the cost of a mobile children’s hospital to be based near Aleppo, and a grant to buy two ambulances for the White Helmets aid group. Matthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “We’ve been overwhelmed by the wonderful generosity of Guardian and Observer readers. The shocking stories and pictures that we’re seeing from Syria right now are daily reminders of the horrific experiences that many of the children and young people seeking safety in the UK have gone through. “Now, more than ever, we need your support to help us make sure that they get the help, protection and warm welcome they desperately need once they get here, and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who has donated so far.” Neil Jameson, the executive director of Citizens UK, the parent charity of Safe Passage, said: “We have been overwhelmed by the Guardian and Observer readers’ response to this year’s appeal. The atrocities we have seen in Aleppo this week serve as a stark reminder of why people are fleeing; that they should have to risk their lives trying to reach sanctuary is an unnecessary cruelty. “Readers’ generous donations will help us continue to fight for safe routes and a warm reception for refugees in the UK.” Josie Naughton, a co-founder of Help Refugees, said: “We are delighted to hear this news and could not be more grateful to everyone who has donated. Thank you for being part of the movement, choosing love over hate. We would also like to thank the Guardian for its incredible support and for this opportunity. Together we will improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable people affected by the refugee crisis this winter.” It is the second successive year that the Guardian and Observer have chosen refugee charities for their annual appeal. Launching this year’s campaign, the Guardian and Observer editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, described the plight of refugees as “the great humanitarian crisis of our times”. On Saturday, Guardian and Observer journalists will hold the annual charity telethon to boost funds for the appeal. Viner, Polly Toynbee, Owen Jones, Marina Hyde, Gary Younge and John Mulholland, the Observer editor, will be among those on hand to take telephone donations from readers. The Guardian and Observer 2016 charity appeal runs until the new year. • Support child refugees by donating here"
2016-10-10T16:45:53Z,Migrants plan day of action to highlight contribution to Britain,"Migrant workers and their supporters are planning a day of action to highlight their role in the UK in what is being billed as a celebration of the contribution they make to British society.Plans for the event, called One Day Without Us, include a labour boycott to show how important migrants are to the UK workforce. Organiser Matt Carr, a writer and commentator, has urged migrants and their supporters to join in the day of action on 20 February 2017. He said the trigger for the event was profound concern about worsening attitudes to migrants in the UK. Carr said he believed that those who voted against Brexit, and also many of those who voted in favour of it, were alarmed at the levels of racism and xenophobia that had manifested before and after the referendum vote. “We want to make this an inclusive event,’’ Carr said. “We realise that because of the legal constraints on striking, many workers will not be able to take formal strike action. However, they can choose to support this event simply by taking the day off work.” He said he was surprised how quickly the event had gathered momentum. Despite discussions taking place in a closed Facebook group over a few days, Carr said there were now about 6,000 people involved in the conversation about A Day Without Us. The aim of the day of action is to emphasise the variety of work migrants undertake to help keep the UK afloat – from NHS doctors to those who staff the hospitality sector. The organisers say a day without migrant labour will demonstrate how much the economy would struggle without their contribution. The day of action, scheduled to coincide with the UN’s World Day of Social Justice, is based on similar events in the US in 2006 and in Italy in 2010. Carr plans to approach religious and community organisations as well as political parties and trade unions to support the idea and to ensure it takes place across the country and is rooted in local communities. Carr said he was hopeful that employers who relied on migrant labour would support the strike and shut their businesses for the day. “Since Brexit we have seen levels of xenophobia and racism that have been increasingly legitimised. We want to make a bold and powerful statement and give migrants an opportunity to express themselves,” he said."
2016-12-18T00:05:36Z,"Alone in Paris, refugee children frantic to see their British families","From a distance, he seemed strangely well fed for a child who had been travelling alone for 18 months. Closer, it became evident that Hassan was only trying to stay alive. Wrapped around the 16-year-old’s slender frame were seven coats. The outer layer, a quilted puffer jacket, engulfed him. It was on Tuesday, just before 6pm as the temperature tumbled in central Paris, when the young Somalian was found shivering on the Avenue de Flandre, close to the Gare du Nord. For four weeks he had survived penniless in Paris, sleeping on pavements in the 10th arrondissement and, when it rained, jostling for a space beneath the Stalingrad metro bridge. “People from all over Africa were gathered there, but you have to hustle for a place to sleep and the police kick people,” he said, managing a rueful smile. Hassan left Mogadishu in July 2015, travelling alone through Kenya, Sudan, Egypt before crossing the Mediterranean in a 12-day odyssey that “made me certain I would never survive”. His ambition had been to reach Calais and, from there, Birmingham where his eldest sister lives. Entering France, he learnt that the vast refugee camp at Calais had been demolished and so he wound up in the French capital. There is no back-up plan: “My sister is all I have.” Hassan’s father died in the continuing Somali civil war. Later, his mother was killed in a terrorist attack by al-Shabaab militants. The teenager was found last week by Laura Griffiths of Safe Passage, which has a team of volunteers combing the French capital for child refugees who, like Hassan, are eligible to enter the UK. Throughout 2016, Safe Passage, founded last year by the social action charity Citizens UK, has ensured that hundreds of unaccompanied child refugees have found safe and legal routes to the UK, defeating the Home Office in the high court and helping force a reticent British government to honour its political and ethical obligations. No one knows how many unaccompanied children are living rough in Paris, hidden in central squats or the city’s peripheral housing projects. More child refugees, many of whom are eligible to enter Britain, arrive daily in Paris. Tracking them down quickly is essential, says Griffiths. Hassan was so vulnerable that when Griffiths found him, a man she assumed was his father turned out to be a stranger who had known him for 10 minutes. “It is difficult though; we’re not going to find 300 unaccompanied minors with family in the UK in a week like we did in Calais. We found three yesterday, all hungry and cold and unable to speak English,” said Griffiths. One of those previously plucked from the city streets was Jamil, an Afghan boy with neatly combed hair and a fragile coating of bumfluff above his top lip. The 14-year-old arrived in the city three weeks ago after hearing Calais was no more. Nights were spent sleeping on wasteland near the Gare de L’Est. “I would see other refugees and lie beside them. I didn’t know where to go, it was very cold. Somehow I lived,” he said, shrugging. His journey to Paris had involved traversing icy Afghan mountain passes and Persian deserts. “I walked for hours and hours, days, without food and water,” he said. For six months Jamil travelled with the sole objective of being reunited with his elder brother in Northampton. Another brother who took the same route before him has disappeared. Returning home is not an option for Jamil. His father, a senior Taliban commander, wanted his youngest son to follow in his footsteps. “I was really frightened, I didn’t want to fight. I told my mother, who was beaten many times by my father, that I wanted to escape.” She surreptitiously sold the family’s gold jewellery to help Jamil escape. He has not heard from her since then. For the child refugees stranded in France but entitled to enter the UK – estimated to be as high as 2,000 – it promises to be a disquieting Christmas. “The Home Office is not providing information, the children haven’t been told the process of how to get to the UK,” said Griffiths. Some have been interviewed by Home Office officials and then told nothing. Others have provided proof of family in the UK but to no avail. Rumours abound the government has decided to stop accepting child refugees altogether. Asked on Friday what was going on, the Home Office eventually issued a statement indicating transfers from Europe would continue. Such confusion has meant some children have abandoned the official French reception centres to head north, where they will risk their lives trying to sneak into Britain. For now, both Hassan and Jamil are in secure accommodation – Hassan said his sleep on Tuesday was the best he has ever had. Safe Passage, using a team of formidable French lawyers, has already started putting together their asylum claims. When talk turns to a fresh start in England, Hassan’s eyes widen. “I want to live with my sister, go to school and then I would love a job,” he said. Jamil wants to save lives. “I want to be educated and excel. After that I want to be a doctor and save people, everyone that I can.”"
2016-09-19T15:13:43Z,Theresa May resists calls for UK to accept more Syrian refugees,"Theresa May has resisted calls for the UK to take in more vulnerable people fleeing Syria as she flew into New York for two summits on refugees hosted by the UN and Barack Obama. Before the summit, the prime minister argued it was better to help more refugees in their own region than resettle a smaller number, and said the UK was the second biggest humanitarian donor to camps in the countries around Syria. Charities, religious leaders and Labour have criticised the government ahead of the summit for agreeing to take only 20,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees over the next four years, even though places for them have already been found with local councils. Speaking on her flight to New York, May dismissed the criticism and pointed to existing UK programmes to help those fleeing war in Syria. Asked by the Guardian whether she would consider calls for Britain to resettle more refugees, she said: “We have always taken the view that we can help more Syrian refugees by putting aid into the region.” She added that some Syrians were also coming to the UK through the normal asylum-seeking routes, as well as 3,000 children from the region. Her answer appears to confirm that May will take the same approach as David Cameron, who only agreed to the programme for vulnerable refugees from Syria under pressure. May was also pressed on the slow progress made towards fulfilling the so-called Dubs amendment by allowing more unaccompanied refugee children in Europe to enter the UK. It emerged this weekend that a 14-year-old year old Afghan boy eligible to be helped was killed trying to make his way illegally to the UK from Calais while his application was delayed. The prime minister insisted that enough was already being done. She said: “We are working with local authorities and NGOs in relation to delivering on the Dubs amendment and we have for example speeded up our processes for ensuring family reunification can take place.” May’s main intervention at the UN summit will be to awarn of the dangers that mass uncontrolled migration poses. She will call for a better global system to manage the movement of people and propose better differentiation between refugees and economic migrants. It is understood that she is unlikely to announce any increase in the quota of refugees to be accepted, but the UK is expected to commit more money and humanitarian aid at the summit. Obama and the outgoing UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hope to make progress in getting world leaders to pledge more help for refugees before the end of their tenures. Amnesty and other groups, however, have criticised the declaration due to be adopted at the UN summit for lacking teeth and merely reiterating humanitarian principles. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was one of 200 religious leaders who called last week for more action from the UK, criticising the government’s response to the refugee crisis as “too slow, too low and too narrow”. David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee in New York, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK would resettle more refugees. “Frankly, the UK should be saying ‘we’ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year’, so four times the current level to match the commitment of countries like Canada.” Maurice Wren, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “These proposals indicate that the prime minister is intent on attempting to reinforce the untenable status quo, blocking off people’s escape routes and leaving poor countries looking after nearly nine out of 10 of the world’s refugees. “What we really need to see instead is the UK leading by example, adopting sustainable solutions aimed at saving refugees’ lives and implementing a more equitable system for sharing responsibility for protecting them.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, called on May to meet the government’s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians two years early and offer more help to those fleeing the war. “This will be a terrible missed opportunity if we don’t get strong international action, and if Britain doesn’t show the leadership needed,” she said. “The prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants, that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy. “After a 14-year-old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children’s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety.” As well as making an intervention on migration, May will host a “round table” on stopping modern slavery and trafficking - one of her personal priorities as home secretary. The prime minister will point to the UK’s new taskforce and announce that the heads of Mi5, Mi6, GCHQ and Interpol will join it when required. “Just as it was Britain that took an historic stand to ban slavery two centuries ago, I am determined that the United Kingdom will once again lead the way in defeating modern slavery,” she said ahead of the session for world leaders. In her maiden speech to the UN on Tuesday, May will call on the UN to deal better with problems that need a global response such as terrorism, mass migration and modern slavery. At the summit, May will also defend the vote for Brexit in her speech to the UN, saying the British people “did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world” but they did want “a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them”. She will echo her claim made at the G20 in China that too many people are feeling left behind by globalisation. May is expected to have bilateral meetings with Ban Ki-moon, and the prime ministers of Pakistan, New Zealand, Egypt, and Turkey. She will also meet the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, for the second time in a fortnight, after Tokyo’s warning at the G20 summit that it’s businesses could leave the UK without more clarity about the consequences the Brexit vote. On Monday evening, May will hold a reception for about 60 executives from companies such as Amazon, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Black Rock, as the UK attempts to calm investors’ fears about Brexit. “What I will be talking about with both American and British leaders is about how we can encourage that trade and investment between the countries,” May said. “Something like a million [British] people wake up each morning and go to work for an American company.”"
2016-11-26T15:52:41Z,Mexico reels at nightmare vision of a Donald Trump White House,"According to Donald Trump, Mexico’s leaders are smart, sharp and cunning. His election gives them a chance to prove it. The Republican is not yet in the White House and already a sense of crisis envelopes Mexico. If Trump follows through on campaign promises he could shred Mexico’s economy, stability and dignity. Will its leaders rise to the challenge? Mexico, like the rest of the world, must wait to see what President Trump does in office. But this nation of 122 million people has special reason for dread. In addition to branding Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, candidate Trump made specific threats that would humiliate and bankrupt the US’s southern neighbour. The top three: seal it off with a 2,000-mile wall and make it pick up the tab; rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta); intercept remittances that sustain millions of families. Any one of those events would be a disaster – all three, a catastrophe. “The export sector is completely dependent on the US market and Trump knows it,” said Ernesto Carmona, of the University of the Incarnate Word, a Texas business university with campuses in Mexico. “If he closes the door to Mexican exports, it will bankrupt the economy.” Mexico’s central bank raised interest rates last week to try to shore up the country’s currency, the peso, which has plunged since 8 November. The Banco de México warned that the global outlook had become “more complex”. Mexicans might be reassured to know their government is “much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning” than US leaders – except that it was Trump who said this. It was an outsider’s jibe against the supposed Washington beltway dummies being outwitted by Mexico’s machiavellian masterminds. Whether they are that smart – or whether Trump is as smart as he claims – remains to be seen. In Nogales, an industrial city bordering Arizona, residents have found wry solace in the notion that the former reality TV star may be dumber than Enrique Peña Nieto, a president not famed as cerebral. “You have to laugh, right?” said Audón Salazar, a taxi driver. “It’s been joke after joke after joke,” said Alma Cota de Yáñez, who runs Fundación del Empresariado Sonorense, a civil society group. “Not that the situation’s funny. We’re stunned.” The mood in Los Pinos, Mexico’s version of the White House, is reportedly sombre, not panicky. But there is little sense of a strategic plan to deal with Trumpism. Few governments, if any, possess one. The casino owner-turned-insurgent populist, after all, had been expected to lose to Hillary Clinton. Plus he has diluted some campaign pledges, leaving his intentions murky. Mexico’s leaders can only guess if it will be business as usual, a Trumpocalypse, or somewhere in between. Four big challenges 1 The peso. It has rallied slightly but remains volatile and weak – the most liquid currency of the emerging countries. Inflation remains relatively stable and there have been no drastic price hikes. “So far the markets are responding to expectations and speculations rather than actual declines in exports or investment flows,” said Jaime Serra Puche, a former business minister and Mexico’s chief Nafta negotiator. “The government is right to let the market adjust rather than entering into a pissing contest of buying and selling dollars, otherwise you’re dead. If we start to see structural changes, then they’ll have to rethink the issue.” 2 Trade. Since Nafta took effect in 1996, the value of exports to the US has jumped sixfold to $320bn last year. Annual trade between the two neighbours is worth more than half a trillion dollars, equalling $11.2bn every week. If Trump renounces Nafta, trade would in theory revert to pre-existing World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs, which are less than 3% for Mexican products but higher for US exports. But Trump has also pledged to slap taxes as high as 35% on Mexican imports, violating WTO rules and throwing Mexico into uncharted territory. The finance minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, has said Mexico will try to persuade the new US leader that Nafta benefits all North America and makes it globally competitive. No date has yet been set for talks but Peña Nieto has floated a meeting with Trump before his 20 January inauguration. 3 Remittances. The $24.8bn Mexican emigrants sent home last year overtook oil revenues for the first time as a source of foreign income. Most was sent by Mexicans in the US – a lifeline for rural families which Trump has threatened to cut or curb. “Any restriction to this income would affect the country’s poorest families,” said Serra. A dramatic restriction could, ironically, spur migration to the US, which has been steadily falling in recent years amid better economic prospects at home. 4 Migration. The record numbers fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador – which are suffering from war-zone levels of violence – present acute humanitarian and logistical challenges for Mexico, which is under pressure from Washington to stem the flow. An estimated 450,000 undocumented migrants and refugees will cross into Mexico from Guatemala in 2016. While many seek asylum in Mexico, most still try to reach the US to join friends and relatives. Carlos Bartolo Solís, director of the migrant shelter in Arriaga, Chiapas, where the freight train known as the Beast begins its journey northwards, said Trump’s victory had created uncertainty. “The shelter is empty. Everyone left after the [election] result to try and push on to the border. They’ve no idea what will happen next year, but do not see the future as promising.” Bartolo fears migrants desperate to reach the US before Trump’s inauguration will take even greater risks to avoid border patrols. “Unfortunately, it’s obvious they will take more risks with coyotes [people smugglers] and look for other more dangerous routes.” One such migrant was José, a 28-year-old Honduran in Nogales who was planning to cross the Sonoran desert before Trump reached the Oval Office. “I want to try now before he’s there, while there’s still time.” Padre Flor María Rigoni, director of the Belén migrant shelter in Tapachula, near Mexico’s Guatemalan border, said Trump’s proposed wall would not deter those desperate to reach the US. “The majority of migrants don’t know who Trump is and they don’t care. For decades, migrants have successfully defied the United States, and those who want to will continue crossing with wings above the wall or with tunnels under the wall or using other strategies that will be invented.”"
2017-12-01T19:03:31Z,"The Guardian view on refugees and migrants: solidarity, not fear | Editorial","The scale of the global humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding since the Arab spring precipitated revolt and instability across the Middle East in 2011 can feel overwhelming. In the past few weeks alone, terrible stories have emerged of the brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, forced to flee Myanmar to grim camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. A fortnight ago, CNN ran a devastating film shot undercover in Libya, showing young migrants from Nigeria being auctioned into slavery. The sight and sound of a market in human beings carries a weight that dwarfs other reporters’ graphic accounts of the scale of the trade. The impact of the CNN report drew unflattering attention to the EU-backed programme run by Libya to detain and repatriate migrants in order to prevent them attempting the Mediterranean crossing into Italy or Spain. This is an arrangement of convenience for Europe. It has led to migrants being held in wretched and degrading conditions that in an unusual rebuke of the countries that pay a significant part of the costs, were condemned by the UN as “inhuman”. This week the EU met with members of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The EU has now signed up to a programme to repatriate migrants rather than leaving the huge task to a country that is still in turmoil after the fall of Gaddafi, which was backed by the UK, France and the US. The great majority of the world’s displaced people flee to the nearest safe place, often another poor or middle-income country: in the past year a million refugees have arrived in Uganda from South Sudan. By far the largest part of the responsibility for those displaced around the Middle East has been borne by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Europe has been reluctant and defensive in responding to a crisis for which it is at least partly to blame. There has been a complete failure to agree a fair process for resettlement of refugees across the 28 member states. Greece and Italy have been left, for years now, to manage an unprecedented influx of desperate men, women and children. In an unparalleled international political vacuum, there has been little global leadership. Last year, the New York declaration on refugees and migrants tried to lay the framework for a positive approach. It starts with recognising realities: the forces that motivate young people to risk death in the hope of a better life need to be met not by the kind of resistance that ends up with thousands being penned up in a filthy Libyan detention centre, but by opening up legal channels of migration. Migrants want to work, and they want to be able to send cash home. Remittances are worth many billions of dollars to the economies of the global south; they cannot replace development aid, but they far outstrip its value. This time next year a UN refugee summit in Morocco aims to have a programme for legal migration in place. A humane policy for migrants would make it easier to distinguish and meet our obligations to refugees, those who flee in fear. The responsibility for displaced people has fallen on poorer countries in a grossly disproportionate way. At the very least, there should be a programme of education so that every child in every camp has a school place. Internally displaced people need to be helped to find work (not always easy) and supported with direct cash payments that will go back into the local economy. But all of this depends on changing attitudes, above all moving away from the language of threat. Many people in the rich world want to – and do – support refugees, often in a more personal way than giving money: Canada’s scheme, for example, of finding sponsors for 15,000 Syrian refugees was hugely oversubscribed. Fear often speaks with a powerful voice. But so can that other great human emotion, solidarity. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has called this crisis a test of humanity. It is one that we must not fail."
2017-12-12T00:01:18Z,"EU leaders complicit in torture of refugees and migrants, Amnesty says","European leaders stand accused by Amnesty International of being knowingly complicit in the torture and exploitation of thousands of migrants and refugees by the EU-financed Libyan coastguard and officials running the country’s detention camps. In an attempt to stem the flow of people across the Mediterranean to Europe, the EU is financing a system that routinely acts in collusion with militia groups and people traffickers to “make money from human suffering”, a report from the human rights group claims. Following the provision of ships, training and funding from the EU and Italy to the Libyan coastguard, the number of arrivals to Italy fell by 67% between July and November compared with the same period in 2016. Deaths at sea have been reduced commensurately. Yet Amnesty claims the coastguard and those to whom they hand over refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, are often acting in cahoots with criminal gangs and militia. Agreements between the coastguard and smugglers are signalled by markings on boats that allow specific vessels to pass through Libyan waters without interception, it is claimed. The coastguard has also been known to escort boats out to international waters. Those are who are intercepted on their way to Europe are sent to camps run by the Libyan general directorate for combating illegal migration (DCIM), where torture for the purposes of extracting money is almost routine, Amnesty reports. One man from Gambia, who was detained for three months, told Amnesty how he was starved and beaten in a detention centre. “They beat me with a rubber hose because they want money to release me,” he said. “They call the family while beating [you] so the family send money.” After interviews with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants and meetings with Libyan officials and others with knowledge of the abuses, Amnesty claims it now has sufficient evidence to take leaders of EU states to international courts over alleged abuses of human right obligations. “You will see us in court,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty’s Europe director. “Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in Libya are at the mercy of the Libyan authorities, militias, armed groups and smugglers often working seamlessly together for financial gain. Tens of thousands are kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centres where they are subjected to systematic abuse. “European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes.” Up to 20,000 people are currently held in what the Amnesty report, Libya’s Dark Web of Collusion, says are overcrowded, unsanitary centres, often under the control of militia and criminals. “For some time there has been concern that the price for stemming migration has been the human rights of those seeking to come to the EU,” the report says. Last month the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the abuse of migrants as “a crime against humanity” and said the EU and the African Union would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks”. In March, a review by the UK Independent Commission for Aid Impact said the UK role in the capacity-building programme with the Libyan coastguard was “deliver[ing] migrants back to a system that leads to indiscriminate and indefinite detention and denies refugees their right to asylum”. The UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, has described the suffering of migrants in Libyan camps as an “outrage to the conscience of humanity”. It is claimed by Amnesty that the EU member states “cannot plausibly claim to be unaware of the grave violations being committed by some of the detention officials and coastguard agents with whom they are so assiduously cooperating”. Brussels stands accused of failing to install the necessary rights protection mechanisms and guarantees from its Libyan counterparts. The reports says: “The lack of any judicial oversight of the detention process and the near total impunity with which officials operate has facilitated the institutionalisation of torture and other ill-treatment in detention centres.” Last month Mohamed Alkoni, the Libyan charge d’affaires, said any proven allegationof slavery was “an act of an individual, and not a systematic practice”."
2017-12-04T18:49:12Z,Pope shines as Trump fails test of leadership on migrants and refugees | Letter,"Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the UN global compacts on migration and refugees (Report, 4 December) is the latest example of the president’s abdication of leadership on a defining issue of our time. It is to be hoped that other leaders respond by redoubling efforts, as they did when Mr Trump announced the US’s abandonment of the Paris agreement. The international community should look to another head of state, Pope Francis, for an example of true leadership. He has made clear that the unprecedented movement of people worldwide constitutes a global phenomenon. As such, it requires a global response, not the renunciation of responsibility. This message will be echoed in the Holy See’s contribution to discussions taking place this week in Mexico. The pope has called our response to the plight faced by displaced people “a test of our humanity”. It is a test other leaders must not fail.

2017-12-01T06:00:35Z,‘They’re usually either enemies or victims’: the refugee crisis on screen,"There’s a moment near the (not particularly happy) ending of Michael Haneke’s new film, Happy End, where a group of African refugees turns up uninvited at a posh, exclusively white restaurant in Calais, to the surprise and embarrassment of all concerned. It’s the type of predicament Haneke enjoys: the bubble of European bourgeois smugness punctured by a sobering dose of reality. For cinema audiences in affluent parts of the world, it is an equally discomfiting experience. Aren’t we just like those restaurant diners, trying to enjoy our leisure time and forget about what’s going on outside? Happy End isn’t specifically about Europe’s migrant crisis, but as Haneke put it in a recent interview: “Calais has become a catchword for all our ignorance about what is happening in the world… We focus so much on our own navels, what’s going on all around us is only of peripheral interest.” For European cinema in particular, this is a challenge: how to faithfully represent the migrant situation to people who don’t necessarily want to hear about it? The influx of refugees and migrants to the continent over the past five years is surely the biggest upheaval Europe has experienced since the second world war. It has altered the landscape in every way – politically, socially, demographically, even physically, when one thinks of the new borders and fences and refugee camps, such as Calais’ notorious “Jungle”. Europe’s film-makers have begun to respond, to the extent that a nod to the migrant crisis is almost becoming obligatory at the awards-friendly end of the business. On the face of it, the personal stories of immigrants and refugees are often highly dramatic and therefore ought to make great cinema, but new modes of cinema may be required. In Haneke’s case, Happy End largely remains within the director’s white, bourgeois comfort zone, though that’s often tainted by racial guilt (looking back to his 2005 film Hidden, especially). That’s a bit of a cake-and-eat-it, for both Haneke – who satirises our indifference to justify his own – and for us, his audience, who can convince ourselves that we’re “engaging” with the migrant crisis when we’re really just watching a movie about it. Other film-makers have also been guilty of this, such as Luca Guadagnino, whose A Bigger Splash also interrupted the party of its moneyed, white hedonists with a few intrusions of migrants, who are clearly having a very different time of it on the Sicilian coast. It’s telling that A Bigger Splash was a remake of a 1969 French film. Apart from the migrant scenes, the basic template of the original wasn’t changed. Guadagnino dodged the issue entirely with his recent followup, Call Me By Your Name – which is set in the 1980s. The film’s depiction of a summery, wealthy European idyll is beguiling, but it’s an illusion that has become harder to maintain in the present day. The latter point has been hammered home by recent documentaries. Gianfranco Rosi’s Fire at Sea is also set in Sicily, on the island of Lampedusa, many of whose natives have become accustomed to boatloads of migrants arriving on their shores. The final portion of the film is particularly shocking, with the film-maker boarding a boat full of traumatised, sick, dehydrated survivors, and many dead bodies. Up in the hills, meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes might be dancing around the pool in A Bigger Splash. Fire At Sea was praised for its empathic, non-judgmental observation, and won the Golden Bear at the 2016 Berlin film festival. Its humane focus was almost exclusively trained on the islanders, however. By contrast, the migrants are practically a faceless, nameless mass. The same is even more true of Ai Weiwei’s new documentary, Human Flow, which chronicles our era of unprecedented human migration, visiting 23 countries around the world. Weiwei gets his hands dirty; we often see him filming the unfolding misery on his mobile phone. He can do little more than bear witness, and perhaps that’s enough. His global celebrity as an artist will hopefully attract attention to the subject. “I don’t see myself as any different from them,” he says. “We may speak totally different languages and have totally different belief systems but I understand them. Like me, they are also afraid of the cold and don’t like standing in the rain or being hungry. Like me, they need a sense of security.” A recurring theme of Human Flow is how displaced peoples are deprived not only of their homes, security and possessions, but also of their identity as individuals. In conveying the scale of the problem, Human Flow often has no choice but to exacerbate that. The film’s most memorable images are often taken from the air or from elevated camera angles, uncomfortably reminiscent of wildlife programmes such as Blue Planet: a boatload of migrants dwarfed by the open sea; a vast Jordanian refugee “city” where people are reduced to ants; lines of people crossing rivers in rural Greece like a migrating herd, on their march to what will be a closed border. There are also harrowing individual testimonies – “Where am I supposed to start my life?” pleads a sick, weeping mother who has walked for 60 days with her son. The film challenges us to multiply one by the other. The maths is impossible. There’s an absence of a human element from most portrayals of migrants, argues Lily Parrott, co-founder of the London Migration film festival. “Representations of migration groups is very binary: in extreme terms, usually as enemies or as victims. And we view these overly simplistic portrayals of peoples to be equally dehumanising in different ways. To reduce people to very simplistic categories is to take away the very things that make them human. We want to problematise and complicate this idea of migrations as something that happens separately from the human experience. Migration is the human experience.”The festival, now in its second year, is one of a growing number of cultural events seeking to discuss, debate and give voice to different perspectives on the migration (the annual Refugee Week is another). The majority of migration is not from the global north to the global south, they point out, and 80% of migrants move to a neighbouring country. In terms of what cinema can do, there’s often value in conveying the point of view of the migrants themselves, rather than those affected by it. It wasn’t that long ago that British cinema had a knack for this, when one thinks back to acclaimed films such as 2000’s Last Resort (concerning a Russian, asylum-seeking single mother in Margate), or Michael Winterbottom’s 2002 docudrama In This World (following two Afghan refugees from Pakistan to London), or Stephen Frears’ Dirty Pretty Things, which cleverly packaged the London immigrant experience into an “underworld” thriller. That tradition looks to be returning, judging by two very different recent hits: God’s Own Country and Paddington.God’s Own Country wasn’t overtly about capturing the immigrant experience, which is perhaps why it did it so well. The sensual, image-led story is tightly focused on the growing passion between a closeted farmer’s son and the Romanian hired hand, and barely touches on national politics, being set in a remote farmstead in the scenic Yorkshire Dales (its maker, Francis Lee, wrote the story before the Brexit referendum). Just a few xenophobic encounters left the overall impression that it’s easier to be gay in modern-day Britain than to be an eastern European immigrant. Paddington and its sequel are a very different beast, but in their abstracted way, they successfully sweeten the pill of the immigrant experience to suit family palettes. To do that without diluting the principles of tolerance, empathy and civility is no small achievement. Fashioning migrant and refugee stories – which often entail suffering and misery – into mainstream entertainment is a difficult circle to square, but given the culture-clash potential, it’s not impossible. The biggest German-language hit of last year was Wilkommen Bei Den Hartmanns, or Welcome To Germany. This broad farce followed a Nigerian refugee’s entry into a wealthy, white Munich family, with an even-handed cast of characters ranging from liberal do-gooders to xenophobic conservatives, Pegida-style nationalists to Islamist sympathisers. The movie was well-timed, coming just after Angela Merkel’s decision to admit some 1 million refugees into Germany, though its intentions were somewhat undermined by the omission of the Nigerian actor’s name (Eric Kabongo) from the poster. If there’s one film-maker who has proved to be equipped to handle the migrant crisis on film, it is Finland’s Aki Kaurismaki, whose last two films have dealt squarely with European refugees, and, crucially given them their humanity. This is all the more surprising given Kaurismaki’s favoured mode of stylised deadpan comedy. His films are full of artful artificiality, dry absurdity and retro fashions – particularly from the 1950s. But the European heritage Kaurismaki evokes is not the nationalist fantasy of “whites only” and closed borders, but one of postwar optimism and civility and openness to outside influences. His 2011 film Le Havre evokes the humanist France of Jean Renoir or François Truffaut in its tale of townsfolk conspiring to hide an African boy from the authorities – he could be a Jewish kid in a second world war film. This year’s followup, The Other Side of Hope, was set in Finland but it feels like the same Kaurismaki country. The story involves a Syrian refugee this time, Khaled, who arrives in the country by accident and immediately checks in with the authorities, who listen sympathetically to his harrowing tale of persecution. But then Khaled is adopted and employed by a retired shirt salesman attempting to open a sushi restaurant. Neither of them know the first thing about sushi, but that’s OK. If the African migrants from Happy End walked into The Other Side of Hope’s sushi restaurant, you feel they would be offered a table straight away, or a job. Kaurismaki’s films are possibly closer to Paddington than Ai Weiwei’s documentary in terms of hard-hitting realism, but where other modes of cinema have failed, his eccentric, personal style is somehow robust enough to address the issues of the age, satisfy entertainment demands, and respect both its subjects and its audience. We all come out of it feeling more human. Perhaps that’s the best cinema can hope to achieve."
2017-07-07T09:10:31Z,"Police remove 2,000 refugees and migrants sleeping rough in Paris","Police have moved more than 2,000 refugees and migrants off the streets of Paris, where they had been sleeping rough for weeks in squalid and insanitary conditions. Riot officers watched the refugees as they were bussed to temporary shelters in school gymnasiums on Friday morning. Hundreds of refugees and migrants had arrived in the Porte de la Chapelle area of northern Paris, sleeping under road bridges and on the side of the road with almost no access to water, sanitation and food, outside Paris’s new aid centre for asylum seekers that was opened in November. The operation to move them began at dawn and took place calmly. Groups of men and women from countries including Afghanistan and Eritrea – some only with small rucksacks or plastic bags of belongings – were sent on to buses and driven out of Paris. It was the 34th police removal of large numbers of refugees and migrants sleeping rough in the French capital since 2015. Aid workers warned that France needed to establish an efficient long-term strategy for processing and housing asylum seekers in decent conditions rather than constantly taking emergency action at the last minute. Many of those sleeping rough had queued each day for access to the aid centre only to find it was full. Hundreds had bedded down on the pavement outside the gates, alongside traffic-choked roads. In recent weeks, more than 1,000 people had been sleeping here, with aid associations saying 200 more arrived each week. The numbers of refugees and migrants sleeping rough in Paris has grown after the closure last October of the Calais migrant camp – a vast makeshift shanty town near the Channel coast where thousands had lived in squalid conditions, hoping to get into Britain by stowing away on board motor vehicles entering the Channel tunnel. On Friday, French authorities organised buses to take people to temporary locations in the Paris region, mainly school gymnasiums that had become available during the holiday season. A 25-year-old former veterinary student who described fleeing violence in Somalia, said he had been sleeping on the street in Paris for one week, with little water or food and no blankets to lie on. He had come to Paris from Calais after several weeks in squalid conditions there. “I’m exhausted from living on the street,” he told the Guardian. “I’m not sure where they are taking us today. I just want to be somewhere fit for humans. I’m so tired and hungry, but you just have to be patient.” A 22-year-old Afghan man said: “It has been two months sleeping under a motorway bridge with little water, not much food, some fights between different groups here. You never really sleep. I would queue every day but there was no hope getting into the aid centre here.” He said he hoped for somewhere to sleep indoors and the possibility to begin an asylum application in France. “We’re humans, we’re not animals.” Guillaume Schers, who runs the emergency programme for Terre d’Asile, a French NGO working with asylum seekers, said: “The number of people arriving in France is not likely to drop this summer.” He said there had to be a permanent, stable and strategic plan for taking care of asylum seekers in France rather than the current “multi-layered and complex” system focused on crisis management. Corinne Torre, the head of French operations for the doctors’ charity Médecins Sans Frontières, said poor hygiene and sanitary conditions for the people who had been sleeping rough in Paris had worsened existing skin infections. But she said cases of scabies had been contained to 7% to 8% of the refugees and migrants, adding that it was not an epidemic, contrary to a rumour spreading among local residents. Torre warned that the major issue was refugees’ and migrants’ mental health after trauma. “Most of these people have come through Libya. Many have faced violence, torture, inhumane treatment, traffickers or sexual violence. We don’t talk enough about that, and there should be better structures in place to deal with it.” Some local politicians in Paris have warned against a continuing cycle of removals and the return of rough sleepers, with a lack of long-term strategy on asylum. The last such police operation in Porte de la Chapelle was only two months ago, when 1,610 migrants were moved. In Calais between 600 and 700 refugees and migrants sleep rough in precarious conditions after the migrant camp was dismantled last autumn. The French human rights ombudsman recently warned of dire conditions for migrants in Calais. Charities and NGOs trying to distribute food and water in Calais complained that the police and local authorities were preventing them from providing basic aid to refugees and migrants, and took court action last month. A court ruled against the creation of a new aid centre in Calais but stipulated that the refugees and migrants must be given access to water, showers and toilets, which the local authorities have refused to provide. The judge said: “It is not possible to leave these people, who are in a state of complete destitution, without any aid.” The state has appealed against the court ruling that stipulated it must provide basic water and sanitation. The new centrist French president, Emmanuel Macron, told both houses of parliament gathered in Versailles this week that he wanted to overhaul the French asylum system, which has been criticised as too slow, inefficient and lacking in protections. Macron said he wanted “a more human, and fairer” treatment of asylum requests by refugees. An announcement is expected in the coming weeks on what form changes to the French asylum system would take. Maya Konforti, a volunteer with the Auberge des Migrants, which works with refugees and migrants, warned of harsh police treatment of those in Calais. She said: “Macron says he wants to put more humanity into the system and speed up the asylum process, that is good. But the ministry of the interior is still doing the dirty work.”"
2017-09-29T04:00:15Z,Surge in migration to Greece fuels misery in refugee camps,"Greece is experiencing a dramatic rise in the number of refugees and migrants entering the country, exacerbating already deplorable living conditions on island camps. The number of people arriving, across land and sea borders, has more than doubled since the beginning of the summer. Authorities estimate arrivals are now at their highest level since March 2016, with over 200 men, women and children being registered every day. “It is dramatic and it is the most vulnerable of the vulnerable coming in,” said Elias Pavlopoulos, who heads Médecins sans Frontières in Greece. “There are whole families fleeing war zones in Syria and Iraq. In the last few months our clinics have seen more people who have suffered violence, who are victims of rape, who have been tortured, than ever before.” Despite a pledge by EU member states in September 2015 to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers – including 106,000 from Greece and Italy – a mere 29,000 have been moved to other European countries so far. With the 28-nation bloc failing to meet the deadline set out in its own plan, mass demonstrations are expected in capitals across Europe this weekend. Refugees and migrants have been arriving in Greece not only on rickety boats from Turkey but by foot across the frontier between the two countries. On Wednesday, police announced 37 refugees – including 19 children - from Iraq, Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, had been dumped by smugglers on the national highway outside Thessaloniki. Human rights groups are increasingly likening the situation to 2015, when, at the height of the migrant crisis that engulfed Europe, Greece saw close to a million people enter the country on onward journeys that often took them to Germany. “We’re living the days of 2015,” said Pantelis Dimitriou from Iliaktida, a local NGO on Lesbos operating accommodation and support centres for the newly arrived. “The flows have become huge. From around 50 to 60 in early July they are now at more than 200 every day. Maybe it is the German elections, maybe it is about Turkey’s [worsening] relations with the EU, or maybe this is the last push before winter, but something is going on.” More worrying is the number of minors making the often treacherous journey to get to Greece. In a statement this week, Save the Children said around 40% of the new arrivals were under the age of 18. Over 1,500 unaccompanied minors are currently on waiting lists in Greece to be housed in child shelters. Visiting Athens for the screening of Sea Sorrow, a 73-minute documentary depicting the plight of refugees, directed by the British actor Vanessa Redgrave, the Labour peer Alf Dubs voiced his dismay. As the architect of a scheme announced last year to bring up to 3,000 child refugees to the UK, the increasingly febrile situation was deeply troubling, he said. Despite 40 children being eligible for transfer, none has taken place in 2017. “I am convinced the Greeks need far more help than they are getting from the international community,” he told the Guardian. “There simply aren’t the facilities or resources here to accommodate new arrivals. The least we should do in the UK is speed up the process of accepting children with families in Britain.” Some unaccompanied minors were “in utter despair, their lives on hold, waiting desperately for news”, he said. Refugee flows dropped dramatically when a landmark accord aimed at stopping the influx was reached between the EU and Turkey in March 2016. In return for €6bn (£5.26bn) in aid – around €2bn every year – Ankara agreed to beef up patrols along its Aegean coast and, where necessary, turn back smuggler boats. The latest surge is placing growing strain on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands where reception centres in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Leros and Samos are vastly overstretched. More than 60,000 people are marooned in Greece. Some 13,352 men, women and children, unable to move since the EU-Turkey deal was signed, are currently stranded on the islands, according to figures released by the Greek interior ministry on Thursday. Riots and violent outbursts in camps are common. In Lesbos, the island on the frontline of the human drama in 2015, the main camp at Moria is currently at twice its holding capacity with 4,825 people registered. The centre is equipped to house no more than 1,800 according to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR. “In November last year we had reached a point where in Moria there were no more people living in tents,” said Dimitriou. “That was when we had a cycle of arrivals and departures, some coming but others also being transferred to the mainland.” Conditions were made worse by the “bottleneck” that appeared as a result of refugee reunifications and relocations slowing down dramatically. “It’s like a perfect storm,” he said. Frustration has mounted amid donor fatigue and growing difficulty accessing funds to meet the increasing need for humanitarian aid on frontline islands. With the state of emergency imposed at the height of the crisis officially rescinded, the Greek government assumed responsibility for services provided to asylum seekers in August, spurring NGOs to leave altogether. Authorities say around 99% of those who make it to Greece request asylum. “The Greek state moves very, very slowly,” said Dimitriou. “It’s impossible to address needs as they should be addressed.”"
2017-08-11T15:22:42Z,Refugee rescue ship sails to aid of anti-migrant activists stranded in Med,"An NGO vessel that has saved the lives of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean is sailing to the rescue of a group of far-right anti-immigration activists whose ship is in difficulties off the coast of Libya. The German NGO Sea Eye said one of its search and rescue boats was on its way to the C-Star, manned by members of the extremist Generation Identity group, which sent a distress signal after an engine failure left it unable to manoeuvre. Michael Busch Heuer, the founder of the Regensburg-based aid organisation, which operates two rescue vessels active in the Mediterranean since early 2016, said it was the duty of anyone at sea “to help those in distress, irrespective of their origin, colour, religion or beliefs”. Sea Eye said in a statement on its Facebook page that it had been informed on Friday morning by Operation Sophia, the joint EU naval operation deterring migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the Mediterranean, that the 40-metre (130ft) C-Star was in difficulty. “Since our vessel the Sea Eye is closest to the C-Star, we were instructed by the maritime rescue coordination centre in Rome, the emergency service for the western Mediterranean, to go to its aid,” the NGO said. Generation Identity’s self-styled “Defend Europe” mission played down the incident, calling it a “minor technical problem” that meant the vessel was “not under command”. Defend Europe chartered the C-Star in Djibouti last month after raising €75,000 (£67,000) through crowdfunding. After originally promising to actively block migrant boats, it now says it is “monitoring” rescues in the Mediterranean. The group – part of a five-year-old movement of young, far-right activists from France, Germany, Austria, Italy and the UK who are opposed to Islam and immigration – accuses NGOs that have rescued about one third of the nearly 100,000 people saved in the Mediterranean this year of illegally working with people smugglers to bring migrants to Europe. Katie Hopkins, the MailOnline columnist, met members of the group in Catania, Sicily, tweeting: “Good to meet Team C-Star @DefendEuropeID. Young people, eight nations, crowdfunded, shining a light on NGO people traffickers in Med.” But the Defend Europe venture has not been an unmitigated success. First, the C-Star was held up for a week in the Suez canal by Egyptian authorities looking for weapons. Then some of its Sri Lankan crew jumped ship when it docked in the Cypriot port of Famagusta last month; several reportedly asked for asylum. The ship’s crew and owner, Sven Tomas Egerstrom, were accused in court of preparing and circulating false documents but later released. After leaving Cyprus on 1 August and being advised not to dock in Greece or Sicily for fear of protests, the vessel, which flies the Mongolian flag, was prevented by Tunisian fishermen from putting into the port of Zarzis for supplies. “If they come here, we’ll block the refuelling channel,” said Chamseddine Bourassine, a local fishermen’s leader. “It is the least we can do given what is happening out in the Mediterranean. Muslims and Africans are dying.” The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, a local NGO, said it would oppose any attempt by the C-Star to dock and take on fresh supplies of fuel, food and water in a Tunisian port. It called on the government “not to cooperate with its racist and dangerous crew”."
2017-12-14T13:00:44Z,Stranded migrants rescued from rocks off Turkey in dramatic operation,"The Turkish coastguard has mounted a dramatic rescue operation in the Aegean Sea, saving 51 people who became stranded on rocks as they attempted to cross to Greece. Authorities intervened after receiving an emergency call at 1.12am local time. The coastguard said the rescue operation could only begin in daylight due to the rocky area and bad sea conditions. Helicopters dropped food and blankets in the night. Footage from the rescue operation near the coastal city of İzmir showed coastguard personnel airlifting a child as others waited on the rocks next to a partially deflated rubber dinghy. Five children and a woman were rescued in this way while the rest were transferred to coastguard boats with the assistance of fishermen in the area, the coastguard said. There was no information on the migrants’ nationalities, but Turkey is home to 3 million refugees from Syria, and many have continued to attempt the risky boat ride across the sea to Greece despite a deal between Ankara and the European Union that has curtailed illegal crossings. While some still attempt the sea route, others try to cross into Greece through the land border, and are sometimes forcibly returned even after entering the Greek mainland. In addition to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, economic migrants from Asia and north Africa also attempt the crossing. More than 800,000 people reached Greece from Turkey at the height of the crisis in 2015, most of them settling in Germany and Sweden. The March 2016 EU deal, under which Turkey cracked down on illegal migration in exchange for an assistance package and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens, has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups, who say Europe has shirked its responsibility to process asylum requests. Since the deal, Turkey says the number of people detained while making the illegal crossing has fallen by 85%. Thousands of refugees and migrants are stranded in camps in Greece as the country attempts to deal with a backlog of asylum requests, and the influx has empowered far right and anti-immigrant parties across Europe. A relocation scheme introduced by the EU in 2015 in an attempt to share the burden of migrant arrivals has been vilified by nationalist governments. Earlier this week the Guardian reported how Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was ready to abandon the policy, which is being discussed by EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. On the ground, the suffering continues. A report by 12 humanitarian organisations released on Wednesday said 2,000 unaccompanied children were stranded on waiting lists for safe shelters in Greece, amid a chronic shortage of housing, with many sleeping rough. While interest has waned in the refugee crisis, humanitarian organisations and governments on the Mediterranean continue to mount rescue missions for stranded people, many of whom now attempt to cross through Libya. A recent CNN investigation in the country documented the horrific and widespread abuse of migrants and refugees, describing how some are sold as slaves in local markets after their capture. Human rights organisations have blamed the European Union, which is providing funds to curtail migration from Libya, for being complicit in the abuses."
2017-05-05T17:57:22Z,Giving migrants and refugees in London a place to stay | Letters,"It was heartbreaking and profoundly depressing to read about Paradzai Nkomo’s terrible experience (Living in limbo, G2, 4 May). What a shocking waste of talent, and a total disregard for women’s potential and what they can offer, wherever they come from. My family, dating right back to my grandmother and the East and West Friendship Council, have always welcomed visitors, students and refugees into our homes and we continue to do so through the Housing Justice’s London hosting network. Our current guest came to live in our spare room in October. He has been in the UK for 15 years, and is equally trapped in the idiocies of the system. He had been living on the night buses for three months, having been homeless for a year. He is one of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met, and has nothing but good to say about all those who he encountered in his enforced wanderings. He also had a plastic bag, and was on crutches. He is now in hospital, having become terribly ill as a result. I want Paradzai to know that there are many of us, and that we welcome her, and if we can help her in any way, we will. Above all, don’t despair.

2017-12-03T15:03:30Z,Donald Trump pulls US out of UN global compact on migration,"The Trump administration has pulled out of the United Nations’ ambitious plans to create a more humane global strategy on migration, saying involvement in the process interferes with American sovereignty, and runs counter to US immigration policies. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, informed the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, at the weekend that Donald Trump was not willing to continue with an American commitment to the UN global compact on migration. The announcement of the US withdrawal from the pact came hours before the opening of a UN global conference on migration scheduled to begin on Monday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. In 2016, the 193 members of the UN general assembly unanimously adopted a non-binding political declaration, the New York declaration for refugees and migrants, pledging to uphold the rights of refugees, help them resettle and ensure they had access to education and jobs. The initiative had the enthusiastic backing of Barack Obama, and was embraced by Guterres as one of his major challenges for 2018. The aim is to publish a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration next year in time for adoption by the UN general assembly in September. Louise Arbour, appointed as the UN’s special representative to oversee the process, regards the global compact as a chance to shift world opinion on the need to address future migration, in the same way that the UN had managed to persuade the world it needed to address climate change. There are currently 60 million people who have been displaced worldwide. The US decision to withdraw will delight Trump’s “America first” political base, but will do little to improve his standing in developing countries. The US mission to the UN said in a statement on Saturday that the declaration “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles”. The UN had always insisted that the compact was never intended to be legally binding on any country, but instead was an attempt to create a shared understanding that migration flows are likely to increase, and need to be regularised by recognising the reality of state interdependence, as much as national sovereignty. In a statement issued on Saturday, Haley said: “America is proud of our immigrant heritage and our longstanding moral leadership in providing support to migrant and refugee populations across the globe … But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.” She said: “We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York declaration is simply not compatible with US sovereignty.” The move, which is likely to put US-UN relations back in the deep freeze, came following pressure largely from the White House, as opposed to Haley herself. The US has already pulled out of the UN climate change treaty and Unesco, the cultural heritage body, accusing the latter’s leadership of an anti-Israeli bias. The impact of the migration pullout is more symbolic than practical, since the UN never had any illusion that it could control a member state’s policies."
2017-11-09T06:00:06Z,Anger rises in Lesbos over crowded refugee camps,"A surge in refugee arrivals has led to soaring tensions on Greece’s outlying Aegean islands, with Lesbos’s mayor accusing the government in Athens of allowing it to become a giant prison camp. Boycotting celebrations on Wednesday marking the 105th anniversary of Lesbos’s liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule, local officials gave the leftist-led coalition in Athens an ultimatum: either it took immediate action to decongest the island or risked mass protests from an increasingly unruly population. “We are utterly opposed to policies that are turning Lesbos and other border areas into concentration camps where all human dignity is denied,” said Spyros Galinos, the island’s mayor. “The government has failed to keep to its commitment to effectively deal with this problem and move people on.” The explosive mood matches the rising number of asylum seekers on Lesbos, the gateway for the vast majority of refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the crisis in 2015. Close to 6,000 people are being held at the island’s main camp in Moria, which was initially established as a temporary measure to house no more than 2,000. After a fourfold daily increase in arrivals nationwide over the past three months, the Greek immigration minister Ioannis Mouzalas said the government was considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. “The rise is concerning,” he told a recent news conference in Athens. Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey to stem the influx in March 2016, refugees reaching Greek islands are forbidden from travelling to the mainland pending completion of asylum requests. As a result nearly 15,000 men, women and children are stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the Aegean islands closest to Turkey’s shores, according to figures released by Greece’s interior ministry. In Lesbos and Samos more than 8,300 asylum seekers and migrants are living in facilities meant for just 3,000. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that refugee and migrant numbers jumped from 3,665 in August to 4,604 in September. “After the fall of Mosul there has been a discernible increase … and 98% of those who come request asylum,” explained Daniel Esdras, the IOM’s Greece office director. “Any change in a conflict zone will automatically have a huge impact on migratory flows.” The containment policy has been denounced by human rights groups. In a letter last month to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, 18 organisations said the abysmal conditions in which people were being made to live – including the elderly, infirm and vulnerable – were placing lives at risk. Municipal authorities have reacted furiously to suggestions that camps be enlarged and new ones established, arguing that expansion in any form will only lure more refugees and migrants. At the height of the refugee crisis before countries along the Balkan corridor closed their frontiers and shut off entry to Europe, locals on Lesbos exhibited extraordinary compassion, rushing to greet refugees and offering aid. But the failure to effectively decongest the islands since the EU-Turkey deal was signed has prompted growing anger with residents blaming overcrowding for almost every ill, including the rise in crime. Alleviation was necessary not only to maintain the dignity of people fleeing poverty and war but to “protect social cohesion in a border area that is of national significance to Greece”, its town hall said. Officials in Athens have been reluctant to criticise Ankara for the increase in numbers, instead attributing the rise to a reflection of Turkey’s strained relations with the EU before a visit to Greece in early December by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “We are Turkey’s neighbour, we are not Luxembourg and so we are careful about what we say,” Ioannis Balafas, the deputy migration minister, told the Guardian. “What we are seeing is a political game. Whenever Turkey wants to put the pressure on Europe it turns on the tap and lets more [people] through.” Giorgos Koumoutsakos, the shadow minister of foreign affairs in the main opposition New Democracy party, agreed. “If it really wanted to, Turkey could more effectively control the flows,” he said. “What we are seeing, it would seem, is a reflection of Turkey’s problematic relationship with the EU.” In the meantime, Greece’s easternmost islands were paying the price."
2017-12-21T07:30:00Z,Breaking down the new Berlin wall: refugee guides show their side of city,"Shaam is an otherwise unremarkable-looking Middle Eastern restaurant. There’s a menu on the wall showing pixelated images of falafel and kibbeh; a hunk of doner meat rotates slowly by the window. But the restaurant has become a place for new arrivals from Syria to congregate. “The name feels like home,” says Mahmoud, a warm and chatty 28-year-old. “It introduces Berlin, away from your family and friends.” Mahmoud is a Syrian of Palestinian heritage who fled the war in Aleppo in 2014 after being imprisoned and tortured by government forces. He is now a guide with Querstadtein, a group organising tours of Berlin, led by refugees. The tours use the context of Berlin’s urban landscape to explain to tourists and locals alike the experience of being a refugee in Germany. Querstadtein, which now has eight guides, was the second refugee tour to crop up in Berlin as the city reacted to the mass influx of migrants that began two years ago. Refugee Voices was co-founded in early 2015 by Lorna Cannon, a British tour guide living in Berlin, and her two friends, both refugees who now volunteer as guides. The tours are a way for “people to meet somebody who is experiencing this life as a refugee, and understand what that means”, Cannon says. The idea is catching on. Refugee Voices has since launched a tour in Copenhagen, run by an Eritrean woman and an Iraqi Kurd, and there are plans to spread to London and Paris in early 2018. It is volunteer-based and free. Querstadtein’s concept is similar, but it pays guides a wage of €200 a month and charges €13 per tour. The cobbled streets of Neukölln, one of Berlin’s most diverse districts, hold a special significance for Mahmoud. “When you talk about the refugee crisis, then you have to talk about meeting points for these people,” he says. “There are always difficulties regarding the procedures and the linguistic barriers when you first arrive. So you have to find a person or place who can help you.” For him, that was Neukölln. More than 40% of the neighbourhood’s residents have an immigrant background, and it is “one of most energetic areas in Berlin”, he says. “It’s the most demanded area for living, simply because it’s full of foreigners. If you are a migrant or come from outside of Berlin, you can find comfort here.” Nearby Sonnenallee is a large thoroughfare bustling with loud shoppers and the hum of traffic. The street, once bisected by the Berlin wall, now represents a different kind of segregation. Home to Lebanese immigrants in the 1970s, Sonnenallee has become a hub for the city’s Middle Eastern communities, and is known locally as “Arab Street”. “This is the meeting point for all refugees and Arabs in the city. It makes them feel at home,” says Mahmoud. In Cafe Sabah, just off the main road, Mahmoud calls for tea and coffee and jokes with the staff in Arabic. I ask if he knows them. “Can you believe that we’re related? He’s my cousin,” he laughs. “Arabs are overly sociable. That person I got to know is the grandson of the cousin of my grandmother. I had never met him before in Syria, even though I knew his father. But here we got to know that he’s a relative of mine.” Since more than a million refugees crossed Germany’s borders, the city’s ethnic makeup has changed: Syrians are now the fourth-largest group of foreigners, behind Turks, Poles and Italians. New, refugee-owned businesses, such as the restaurants Alagami and Yasmin Alsham, have opened up as these new communities gradually establish themselves. “It’s easy to say, ‘Ich bin ein Berliner.’ It’s a very multicultural place – you feel like it’s your city,” says Mahmoud. Though Berlin may be multicultural, it remains polarised. The diverse areas of Neukölln and Kreuzberg are a far cry from the far-right hotbeds of Marzahn-Hellersdorf, which are “no-go areas for refugees who look visibly ‘different’”, says Dr Sina Arnold, a researcher at the Berlin Institute for Migration. “It creates a climate of fear for people who thought they had arrived in a safe place.” These fears have become even more prominent in the wake of September’s federal elections, when the far-right AfD won 12.6% of the vote. In the districts where AfD increased its share, “there is generally only a small percentage of migrant population, which also results in a lack of solidarity structures for refugees and migrants”, Arnold says. “It means that some refugees are afraid to leave the shelter after dark, or to walk outside alone, or be visibly identifiable as a Muslim.” There were around 3,500 attacks on refugees or refugee shelters in Germany in 2016. Arnold witnessed an assault in March last year in Marzhan, when a man poured vodka on a young Syrian, spat on him and gave a Nazi salute. Walid, a guide with Refugee Voices who asked for his name to be changed, says he’s afraid of what might happen. “[The far right] are getting more powerful; lots of people are believing them and starting to be more afraid,” he says. The tours aim to offer a space for reconciliation, with the guides hoping that presenting their own views and experiences of Berlin will help cross the barriers of perceived “otherness”. “It’s really rare to find a normal way of interacting, because people have a stereotype,” Walid adds. “There’s a huge misunderstanding of what a refugee is. If people understand the context and history of what made people come here, they will start to deal with them differently.” Do the tours also risk becoming what the Germans call Elendstourismus, or “misery tourism”? “If I felt that people were giving that sense of ‘poor people’, I wouldn’t continue,” says Mohamad, co-founder of Refugee Voices. “This is not the point of the tour.” Instead, he says, it is about forming a connection between experiences. Outside Berlin’s finance ministry on the corner of Leipziger Straße, Walid describes the June 1953 demonstrations here that were brutally suppressed by Soviet forces. Hundreds of people died “just asking for their basic rights”, Walid says. In Leipziger Straße’s scarred buildings Walid sees the streets of Hama, Syria, where half a million people gathered to protest against the government in 2011, an uprising that was violently crushed. “It’s a similar story of people trying to get their freedom, their rights, what they should have,” he says. Walid left Syria with his brother Mohamad, also a guide with Refugee Voices, after he was blacklisted by the Assad government for being active on social media. “We got a tip from somebody that his name was on a list that if the government catches him at any checkpoint it will be very bad for him,” his brother says. Upon arriving in Berlin, they stayed in a student dorm in Lichtenberg in the east of the city, which was converted into a temporary refugee shelter. While this area, like Marzhan, has a reputation for hostility to foreigners, Walid says the main problem was being in the limbo of shelters, not having your own place to live and socialise. “It’s hard to settle if you’re being moved to another camp.” He eventually found a home in Wedding, a few U-Bahn stops north of the city centre, where he ends his tour at his favourite family-run Syrian restaurant, Mandi. “Berlin gives me hope,” says Walid. “This city was heavily damaged in the second world war, and in a few years it was rebuilt and there was democracy. That’s what gives me hope for Syria now: that one day we might be able to build it again.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
2017-09-10T23:01:50Z,Migrant sea route to Italy is world's most lethal,"More than 22,500 migrants have reportedly died or disappeared globally since 2014 – more than half of them perishing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to a study by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). A clampdown on Europe’s eastern borders has forced migrants to choose more dangerous routes as the death toll in the Mediterranean continues to rise despite a drop in the overall number of arrivals, data compiled by the UN’s migration agency shows. “While overall numbers of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean by the eastern route were reduced significantly in 2016 by the EU-Turkey deal, death rates have increased to 2.1 per 100 in 2017, relative to 1.2 in 2016,” reads the IOM report which is released on Monday. “Part of this rise is due to the greater proportion of migrants now taking the most dangerous route – that across the central Mediterranean – such that 1 in 49 migrants now died on this route in 2016.” Since 2014, more deaths have been documented on this route than any other migration route in the world. In the first half of this year, the IOM said at least 3,110 migrants have died or disappeared globally, which is lower than the figure in 2016 (4,348), but the risk of dying has increased in the Mediterranean even though fewer migrants crossed into Europe. “The central Mediterranean route, ending at Lampedusa or the main island of Sicily, accounts only for about a quarter of almost 1.5 million people who have arrived since 2014 on all routes, but for 88% of all migrant deaths in the Mediterranean,” it said. Last month, Amnesty International criticised Italy for taking measures to keep migrants away from its shores, which it said leads “in their arbitrary detention in centres where they are at almost certain risk of torture, rape and even of being killed”. The IOM’s report also complained about smugglers in Libya and Italy increasingly using less seaworthy vessels. Jean-Guy Vataux, head of mission in Libya for Médecins Sans Frontières, told the Guardian nearly all the people rescued from drowning in the Mediterranean have been “exposed to an alarming level of violence and exploitation: kidnap for ransom, forced labour, sexual violence and enforced prostitution, being kept in captivity or detained arbitrarily”. According to Vataux, the majority of migrants in Libya live clandestinely “under the yoke of smugglers or – for the most unlucky – kidnapping organisations”. He added: “Migrants going through Libya to reach Europe are facing impossible choices: getting on a boat is very risky, many die before they reach the European coast or a rescue ship. Remaining in Libya, whether in detention centres run by the administration or a criminal organisation, exposes them to unbelievable levels of violence and exploitation. There needs to be other options made available very quickly, like safe passage to other Mediterranean countries.” Restrictions on the eastern route meant the number of arrivals in countries such as Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia had dramatically dropped. The three countries, which are not a part of the EU border-free Schengen zone, restricted migrants’ access in late 2015. In the first half of this year, at least seven migrants have died of hypothermia during the winter months in the western Balkans. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has recently published a report warning of the dangers in the route. A mother and son who successfully crossed the Evros river – along the border between Turkey and Greece – both later died of hypothermia. More than 120,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year – most departed from Libya bound for Italy, from Turkey bound for Greece or, more recently, from Morocco bound for Spain. About 82% of all migrants were travelling to Italy from Libya. In June, the Italian coastguard rescued about 5,000 people in one day in the Mediterranean. The IOM report covers the period from January 2014 to the end of June and thus does not reflect the recent developments in Myanmar, where atrocities against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority has led to an exodus of thousands to neighbouring Bangladesh. The IOM report, titled Fatal Journeys, has been compiled by the Berlin-based Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC). It is the only existing database on migrant deaths at the global level, collected through various means including official records, medical examiners and media reports. Ann Singleton, senior research fellow at the University of Bristol’s school for policy studies, said: “For the families left behind it could make a real difference if they are able to find more information on their missing relatives. Better data on migrant fatalities can also help inform policies aimed at reducing migrant deaths.” Global figures for the first half of 2017 show that northern Africa also had high fatalities and disappearances, with at least 225 recorded deaths. The majority of incidents occurred along routes from western Africa and the Horn of Africa towards Libya and Egypt. Sickness or violence are the main cause of death in those cases. At least 150 deaths were also recorded in the US-Mexico border crossings since January. “Along the border, irregular migrants avoid coming into contact with authorities in well-patrolled areas and are often forced to cross natural hazards such as the desert of Arizona or the fast-running Rio Grande river,” IOM said. More people have died attempting to cross the border compared with last year despite an ease in border apprehensions of migrants. Recent clampdowns on the Libya-Italy route have also led to the increase in attempts to reach the continent via Morocco. The IOM has said the number of people arriving in Spain by sea this year is likely to outnumber the number arriving in Greece. Francesca Friz-Prguda, UNHCR representative in Spain, who recently visited the port cities of Tarifa and Algeciras, where refugees are arriving almost daily after crossing the strait of Gibraltar from Morocco, said Spain was underprepared and lacked an integrated national strategy. More than 14,000 migrants have arrived by sea – a 90% increase compared with last year. Arrivals in Andalusian ports have tripled. “While this is really not an emergency situation if you compare it to Italy, there are no adequate structures and procedures in place to deal even with the current level, let alone with more arrivals,” she said. “It’s a myth to assume that people arriving here are all economic migrants, sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most refugee-producing regions in the world, so even statistically there’s a likelihood that these mixed flows are refugees travelling,” she said. “A lot of media have not dealt with the issue in a very responsible way, talking about avalanches and storms, flood, and God knows what – there’s a clearly a perception which doesn’t seem to sufficiently understand that first there are many refugee-producing countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”"
2017-12-11T16:25:19Z,EU could 'scrap refugee quota scheme',"The EU could scrap a divisive scheme that compels member states to accept quotas of refugees, one of the bloc’s most senior leaders will say this week. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, will tell EU leaders at a summit on Thursday that mandatory quotas have been divisive and ineffective, in a clear sign that he is ready to abandon the policy that has created bitter splits across the continent. Tusk will set a six-month deadline for EU leaders to reach unanimous agreement on reforms to the European asylum system, but will propose alternatives if there is no consensus. “If there is no solution … including on the issue of mandatory quotas, the president of the European council will present a way forward,” states a draft letter from Tusk to national capitals, seen by the Guardian. In effect this means scrapping mandatory quotas, because Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are fiercely opposed to the idea of dispersing refugees around the bloc based on a formula drawn up in Brussels. Tusk is likely to face opposition, however, from other EU bodies, including the European commission. EU leaders introduced compulsory quotas in 2015 at the height of the migration crisis, as thousands of people arrived daily on Europe’s shores, many of whom were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea. Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the move, but the policy was forced through by a majority vote. Hungary and Poland have defied the rest of the EU by not taking a single refugee under the scheme, which aimed to relocate about 120,000 refugees, mainly Syrians. The Czech republic has taken in only 12. All three countries were referred to the European court of justice last week for failing to implement the policy, the usual procedure for flouting EU rules. Despite the backlash against the emergency scheme, the European commission proposed making quotas a permanent feature of EU law in 2016. Under its proposal, countries that refuse to take part in a “corrective allocation mechanism” to take the pressure off member states bearing the brunt would have to pay a “solidarity contribution” of €250,000 (£220,000) per asylum seeker. The idea has been stalled for months, as home affairs ministers who make the law have been unable to agree on it. Any move to drop the plan is likely to upset Italy and Greece, countries that have urged the rest of the EU to help them cope with large numbers of refugees and migrants in recent years. Germany and Sweden, backed by the European commission, are also likely to contest any plan deemed to reduce the help offered by other member states. One EU diplomat said some member states were surprised by Tusk’s letter “because it doesn’t seem to be in sync” with work undertaken by home affairs ministers working on the file. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, thinks mandatory quotas have been a gift to hardliners, such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has seized on migration as part of his wider Stop Brussels campaign. Eurosceptics in Poland, such as the Law and Justice leader Jarosław Kaczyński, whose party won an election victory over Tusk’s centre-right group in October 2015, have also criticised the policy. Tusk’s scepticism about the prospect of consensus has been evident for months. He said in October that mandatory quotas had put members states in almost permanent conflict. Tusk will call on EU governments to take charge, rather than leaving Brussels to set the pace in managing refugee policy. “Only member states are able to tackle the migration crisis effectively,” Tusk’s letter says. “The EU’s role is to offer its full support in all possible ways to help member states handle the migration crisis. But the EU has neither the capacity nor legal possibilities to replace member states.” He will also urge EU leaders to spend more on schemes aimed at keeping refugees and would-be migrants outside Europe, such as €3bn for Syrian refugees in Turkey and the €1.9bn EU Africa trust fund. The EU will confront an earlier promise to give Turkey’s government a further €3bn to help Syrian refugees in early 2018, which could lead to a repeat of EU institutions asking governments to find more cash. The EU has improvised such schemes in response to crises, but Tusk wants more funds available from the new seven-year budget covering the period from 2021, which will come up for discussion next year. He is calling for “stable and long-term financing mechanisms, in place of the existing ad hoc pledging on a much larger scale”, but has stopped short of putting a price tag on future migration policy."
2017-10-29T20:29:47Z,"Australia's asylum boat turnbacks are illegal and risk lives, UN told","Australia’s “push-backs” of asylum seeker boats are illegal under international law and “may intentionally put lives at risk,” the United Nation’s global expert on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, has said in a formal report to the UN general assembly. Special rapporteur Agnes Callamard’s report, Unlawful Death of Refugees and Migrants, focuses on government responses to worldwide flows of migrants across borders. Callamard said around the world, governments were acting punitively and recklessly towards migrants. She identified “multiple failures on the part of states to respect and protect refugees’ and migrants’ right to life, such as unlawful killings … and as a result of deterrence policies and practices which increase the risk of death”. Callamard wrote that in a global environment where refugees and migrants were demonised, and the act of moving to another place criminalised, countries had designed migration policies based on deterrence, militarisation, and that tolerated the risk of migrant deaths as part of controlling entry. “Deterrence policies are punitive, including policies ranging from securing the more accessible border entry points — thereby purposefully funnelling the migration flows into more hazardous terrain — to the imposition of strict detention and return policies.” Callamard highlighted cases where migrants are reportedly attacked and killed by government authorities, including in Libya, Mexico, Egypt, and the Sudan. But Australia is singled out for criticism for its policy of forcibly intercepting asylum seeker boats and pushing them back to where they had come from. “‘Push-back’ measures, in addition to violating the principle of ‘non-refoulement’, may also amount to excessive use of force whenever officials place refugees or migrants intentionally and knowingly in circumstances where they may be killed or their lives endangered because of the environment,” Callamard wrote. “This includes the 2013 policy of the government of Australia of intercepting boats to direct them back to the country from where the vessel departed. “Such practices raise serious concerns: they may intentionally put lives at risk, given that security officials know, but disregard, the reality that returnees may be victims of brutal crimes when returned under these circumstances. This may amount to excessive use of force by proxy; it is disproportionate and unnecessary.” Callamard urged Australia, and other states, to find ways to protect their borders while also providing protection to those who need it, and upholding international law. “States can effectively control their borders in a rights-based and protection-sensitive manner. This includes abiding by the principle of non-refoulement and international norms on the use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity in the implementation of border policies.” Since 2013, the government has reported turned back 771 asylum seekers on 31 boats from Australian territorial waters or land. The government says the policy acts as an effective deterrent to people seeking asylum by boat, and reducing the risk of deaths by drowning at sea. “Since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced we have not had a drowning at sea in three years,” the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said earlier this year. “We have destroyed the people smugglers’ product. Their product was ‘pay the money, hop on the boat, you’ll settle in Australia’. “We’ve taken the sugar off the table. We’ve upturned the table and we’ve said to people that you aren’t coming here.” But the policy has attracted significant criticism. The Australian government was accused of engaging in people-smuggling itself in 2015, when it paid $US30,000 to the captain and crew of an asylum seeker boat coming from Indonesia to turn it around. Other asylum seekers have been put into lifeboats and directed to return to Indonesia. In some cases, these vessels have run out of petrol, and have been found, drifting, by fishing boats off the archipelago, or have foundered on rocks trying to make landfall. In 2014, a group of 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers, intercepted by Australian authorities, were held at sea on a customs vessel for 29 days while Australia tried to take them back to India. India refused to accept them, and the asylum seekers were taken, first to Australia, and then to Nauru. Australia’s process of “on-water assessment” of claims for refugee status has been consistently criticised by international law experts, who argue the perfunctory questioning, often involving interpreters on unreliable phone lines and without legal representation, is unfair and risks sending people home to danger. More broadly, Australia has found itself under sustained criticism by various arms of the United Nations, as it has sought to promote itself globally as a defender of human rights. Australia was elected to the UN Human Rights Council – in an uncontested “clean slate” ballot – this month, but the three-year term on the powerful body has brought with it a new level of global scrutiny on rights abuses in the country, particularly of refugees and asylum seekers. The Human Rights Law Centre’s director of legal advocacy, Daniel Webb, said there was a rising tide of global condemnation directed towards Australia over its mistreatment of refugees, and that refugee policy would overshadow and hamper all of its efforts on the council. “Our government is just two weeks into a three-year term on the Human Rights Council and already it’s clear that its cruelty to refugees will haunt it wherever it goes. “For as long as our government continues to deliberately mistreat innocent people – people just seeking a chance at life in freedom and safety – Australia will lack credibility or moral authority on human rights.” In the week Australia won its position on the New York-based Human Rights Council, the UN’s Human Rights Committee, which sits in Geneva, excoriated Australia for ignoring its legal requirements to amend rights abuses and adhere to the international treaties to which it willingly signed up. Prof Yuval Shany, the committee’s vice-chair, said it was unacceptable for Australia to routinely reject the committee’s views, or “self-judge” international human rights treaties, telling Australia it could not pick and choose which laws it sought to follow and which rights it wanted to uphold. And a week earlier, the regional representative for the UN high commissioner for refugees, Thomas Albrecht said Australia had responsibility to prevent the looming humanitarian emergency caused by its enforced closure of its Manus Island offshore detention centre while hundreds of men remained living there. “Having created the present crisis, to now abandon the same acutely vulnerable human beings would be unconscionable,” Albrecht said. “Legally and morally, Australia cannot walk away from all those it has forcibly transferred to Papua New Guinea and Nauru.”"
2017-12-20T12:00:26Z,Coming to the aid of drowning migrants? Get ready to be treated like a criminal | Lorena Gazzotti,"Activists and NGOs defending migrants’ rights will remember 2017 as the year in which they were targeted by legal systems in Europe and north Africa. Take the case of Helena Maleno Garzón, a Spanish journalist and human rights advocate. You may not have heard of her. But authorities on both sides of the strait of Gibraltar know her well. Maleno, who has been living in Tangier since 2001, will on 27 December face a hearing as part of an investigation by Moroccan authorities into her alleged collusion with smuggling and human-trafficking networks. Central to the case are the calls that Maleno has been making to the Spanish and the Moroccan coastguards since 2007 about boats in distress in the strait and the Alboran Sea. Because of their proximity to migrant communities in northern Morocco, Maleno and other activists regularly receive distress calls, and they relay the signals to naval authorities, a vital step in ensuring migrants’ rescue. You may think what she does is simply humane, but the Moroccan investigation mirrors proceedings on the Spanish side of the strait, where police launched an investigation based on similar allegations a few years ago. It was dropped earlier this year due to lack of evidence of any criminal activity. One can see why governments are trying to discourage Maleno. Her work has made her an inconvenient witness to the deadly consequences of border surveillance policies. Unlawful deportations from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, migrants injured by border guards during attempts to jump the fences dividing Spanish and Moroccan territory, countless migrants perishing in the strait: these are just some facts documented by Maleno in a recent report for the collective Caminando Fronteras. These are events that demand authorities live up to their responsibilities – and address human rights violations and the humiliating living conditions endured each day by migrants at the border. This story is part of a disturbing pattern in which European states are attempting to criminalise activists operating in different parts of the Mediterranean. Consider the allegations of facilitating irregular migration directed by Italian authorities at NGOs conducting search and rescue in the central Mediterranean, or the French farmer Cédric Herrou, given a suspended jail sentence for assisting migrants arriving from Italy. The investigation in Italy into the NGO Jugend Rettet, an organisation of young Europeans who perform search and rescue missions, is continuing. What is happening here seems clear: in order to sustain current border policies, allegations of facilitating migration and collusion with smuggling networks have become the new weapon on both shores of the Mediterranean to discredit those who challenge restrictive migration policies. The presence of activists and solidarity networks at crossing points troubles those in charge of European migration policies for two reasons. First, there is the enduring myth of the “pull factor”, which says that providing assistance to distressed migrants increases their willingness to cross. Decreasing the pull factors, they say, will reduce the number of migrants making for the Mediterranean’s European coast – even though research has largely disproved this argument. Second, NGOs and activists are inconvenient witnesses to the brutal and inhumane consequences of migration policies. The work of activists like Maleno, patiently collecting testimony that contradicts official explanations, has led to judicial procedures being reopened. This includes the investigation into the deaths in 2014 of 15 migrants off Tarajal beach, in Ceuta, allegedly as a result of the actions of Spanish civil guards. The criminalisation of activists and solidarity networks reduces and discourage the ability of independent actors to monitor and criticise the conduct of state authorities, which is a principle of the democratic process. To appease the obsession for border control, these unfair attacks undermine that democratic scrutiny. But the damage goes further. Discouraging activists bolsters the view that some lives are worth less than others. And that the fact that migrants might perish during the crossing should be simply accepted as part of the game. Commenting on her own case, Maleno raised the concern that should worry everybody. “The most painful thing,” she said. “Is the normalisation of the loss of the right to life.” • Lorena Gazzotti is an academic specialising in migration and refugee studies"
2017-11-01T22:28:40Z,Foster carers housing lone child refugees to receive specialist training,"The government has announced specialist training for 1,000 foster carers looking after unaccompanied migrant children, ahead of a key court ruling on a decision to wind up a scheme under which child refugees are brought to the UK. The announcement comes as ministers face criticism for the UK’s failure to accept any child refugees from Greece or Italy since the Dubs scheme to help settle lone child asylum seekers was created last year. Only 200 vulnerable children have been brought to the UK under the scheme; a further 280 places offered by councils around the UK are currently unfilled. A court case brought by the charity Help Refugees will rule on Thursday morning on the legality of a government decision not to continue with the Dubs scheme, designed to bring vulnerable refugee children in Europe to the UK. The charity launched a legal challenge in the summer on whether the government had failed to implement the Dubs amendment properly. Robert Goodwill, minister for children and families, said: “Child refugees are some of the most vulnerable in our country and it is vital that we support them as they build safer lives, often in the care of new families. Foster carers do an incredible job, but they must have tailored support to help them deal with the complex needs of these children.” The new training scheme for foster carers and support workers will get £200,000 in funding between 2017 and 2019, the government said. An additional £60,000 investment will provide a package of revised guidance, information and resources for councils. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said: “Last year almost 3,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in the UK and they all require ongoing care and protection.” The government’s new safeguarding strategy on unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee children received a qualified welcome from charities supporting refugee children. Ilona Pinter, from the Children’s Society, said it was a constructive move, but that she was worried that the “government has not committed to reviewing access to legal aid for unaccompanied children’s immigration applications to remain in the UK”. These issues, as well as post-Brexit arrangements for child refugees, will be debated in parliament later on Thursday. Around 200 migrant children hoping to travel to the UK are currently sleeping rough in Calais and nearby port towns. Roughly a third are believed to have family in the UK. The French government this week opened a temporary centre for unaccompanied child refugees in the town, a year after the informal camp that housed 10,000 migrants by the French port was demolished, according to the British charity Safe Passage, which campaigns for safe legal routes for refugees seeking protection. Run by the French children’s charity France Terre d’Asile, the centre will offer around 20 places and is expected to be temporary, according to Safe Passage’s French-based staff. No official announcement has been made about the centre’s opening, although it is understood to have allowed some children in on Monday. The centre is designed to accommodate young people hoping to be reunited with family in the UK and those deemed eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs scheme, the charity said. The decision to open the centre is a significant move, given the reluctance of French authorities to create any kind of centre that might attract more migrants to the port. It will mean that those young people housed there will no longer have to sleep in the bushes around the port. Since the camp’s demolition last year, local police have routinely removed tents and any semi-permanent structures from the woods on the town’s outskirts, leaving migrants to live in the open, with no access to sanitation, tents, showers or food. Alf Dubs, who arrived as a child in the UK as a kindertransport refugee and who persuaded the government to set up the scheme for unaccompanied child refugees (which was originally designed to help up to 3,000 children), said: “The development of a centre near Calais is welcome, but it must be permanent and provide legal support to children trying to access safe and legal routes to Britain. “We must put an end to desperate children jumping on lorries, risking their lives and others as they seek to reach their loved ones – as is their legal right.”"
2017-02-02T15:39:50Z,Coldplay throw support behind refugee and migrant charity,"Coldplay have thrown their support behind a charity which has saved the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing war and persecution in the Middle East. The band, which has a long history of support for a range of charitable causes, has become a long-term patron of Moas (Migrant Offshore Aid Station), which operates professional search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin said: “Every year, Moas rescue thousands of people who risk death at sea while searching for a better life. But for an accident of geography, those people could be us and we could be them. For this reason, we’re proud to support Moas’ life-saving work”. Over the past two years Moas boats have rescued an estimated 33,000 refugees attempting perilous crossings to Europe in often overcrowded and unseaworthy rubber dinghies. The majority of refugees were from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Last year, at least 5,079 refugees and migrants drowned while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to the UN Migration Agency, although some charities believe this figure is likely to be an underestimate. Martin sings an a capella version of his song Don’t Panic on a short fundraising film released on Thursday that features footage of a recent rescue. Moas said the film “aims to give the viewer an immersive experience of a rescue and show the fear, hope and anguish experienced by the refugees and migrants”. The timing of the band’s announcement came amid increasing global political tension over refugees and border controls, including Donald Trump announcing controversial measures designed to prevent refugees from entering the US. Moas said that in light of recent political developments Coldplay believed it was more important than ever to support vulnerable people. Founder Regina Catrambone said: “We are very grateful to Coldplay for believing so strongly in our cause”. “Moas is a young organisation that in a few years has managed to make a significant difference in mitigating one of the most heart-breaking humanitarian tragedies of our era. However, there is still so much to be done. Coldplay’s support will allow our work to reach the hearts of a wider audience worldwide.” Moas was founded in 2014 by two Italian-American entrepreneurs, Chris and Regina Catrambone, after a humanitarian disaster in October 2013 when an estimated 400 people drowned off the island of Lampedusa. It was one of six refugee charities that benefited from the Guardian and Observer’s 2015 charity appeal, which raised £2.6m. Coldplay have supported a number of charities over the years, including Oxfam, the Red Cross, War Child, Amnesty International and Kids Company. Martin reportedly donates 10% of his annual income to charity."
2017-08-17T12:02:14Z,"Spain lacks capacity to handle migration surge, says UN refugee agency","Spain lacks the resources and capacity to protect the rising number of refugees and migrants reaching it by sea, the UN refugee agency has said. The warning from UNHCR comes as the Spanish coastguard said it rescued 593 people in a day from 15 small paddle boats, including 35 children and a baby, after they attempted to cross the seven-mile Strait of Gibraltar. The number of refugees and migrants risking the sea journey between Morocco and Spain has been rising sharply, with the one-day figure the largest since August 2014, when about 1,300 people landed on the Spanish coast in a 24-hour period. About 9,300 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea so far this year, while a further 3,500 have made it to two Spanish enclaves in north Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, the EU’s only land borders with Africa. María Jesús Vega, a spokeswoman for UNHCR Spain, said police were badly under-resourced and there was a lack of interpreters and a shortage of accommodation for the new arrivals. “The state isn’t prepared and there aren’t even the resources and the means to deal with the usual flow of people arriving by sea,” she said. “Given the current rise, we’re seeing an overflow situation when it comes to local authorities trying to cope at arrival points.” Vega said the agency was seeing a very high number of vulnerable people including women, victims of people-trafficking, and children. “What we’re asking is for there to be the right mechanisms in place to ensure people are treated with dignity when they come,” she said. Last week, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said Spain could become more popular than Greece as a destination for people seeking to enter Europe, as some look for alternatives to Italy. About 12,440 people have arrived in Greece so far in 2017, according to UNHCR. The numbers heading to Spain and Greece are dwarfed by Italy, which has seen 97,376 arrivals so far this year. Although this is a reduction on the 101,512 people who arrived during the same period in 2016, the issue continues to cause problems for the authorities, with almost 5,000 people reaching Italy on one day in June. William Spindler, a spokesman for UNHCR in Geneva, said: “There have been three main routes into Europe for many years, for decades: the central Mediterranean one, the eastern one from Turkey to Greece, and there has always been Spain. “What is true is that when efforts are made to clamp down on one route, another tends to open up.” UNHCR figures show that most of those arriving in Spain by sea set out from Morocco, although some also embark from Algeria. The majority of the migrants are from Cameroon, Guinea and the Gambia. Vega said the continuing instability in Libya meant people trying to escape the war in Syria were trying to reach Europe via Ceuta and Melilla. She said the agency had noticed an increase in the number of Moroccans travelling to Spain, coinciding with the end of Ramadan and unrest in the Rif region. Although Vega stressed that the situation in Spain was hardly comparable with Italy, she said Madrid needed to do much more. “This could be managed quite simply if it were properly addressed,” she said. “[But] if there isn’t a proper response, we could see people who have fallen into the clutches of people-traffickers becoming merchandise. We’re going to see people who should have international protection facing danger if they’re returned home.” Statistics compiled by the IOM show that more than 113,000 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea this year. To date, more than 2,300 have died in the attempt, 119 of them while trying to reach Spain. Italy has embarked on a flurry of initiatives to reduce numbers, including a diplomatic campaign to persuade tribes in the south of Libya to clamp down on people smugglers. Marco Minniti, the Italian interior minister, has insisted that NGOs involved in sea rescues sign a code of conduct, which was sharply criticised by the UN-backed IOM. Several aid groups refused to sign the code of conduct because they thought their neutrality would be compromised by taking armed police officers on board. At least three organisations signed it. The Italian government remains under pressure, as neighbouring countries have tightened border controls, meaning refugees and migrants are unable to head north to France or Austria as they have done in the past. On Wednesday, 70 Austrian troops were deployed to the Brenner pass to help police with border checks, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. UNHCR said it was too soon to tell whether the recent drop in arrivals in Italy represented a downward trend or a temporary fluctuation. Under pressure from the EU, the Libyan coastguard has stepped up interceptions of boats, while some NGOs have suspended work in the central Mediterranean because they felt threatened by Libya’s coastguard. Both could explain the recent fall in sea crossings, but Spindler said: “We don’t have any hard evidence. We could see an increase in the next few weeks.” Vega said the international community needed to do more to tackle the root causes of migration, such as conflict, climate change and economic instability, to reduce numbers. “It’s clear that walls and fences aren’t going to deter anyone who’s desperate enough to risk their life and those of their children. Whatever lies ahead of them, it can’t be worse than what they’re leaving behind. They know they could die,” she said. The Spanish government did not respond to a request for comment."
2017-12-14T18:04:49Z,Bitter divisions over migration threaten show of unity at EU summit,"Divisions over migration marred a show of unity at an EU summit on Thursday, after Germany and Italy hit back at plans that could spell the end of mandatory refugee quotas. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have led criticism of a proposal from the European council president, Donald Tusk, who has described refugee quotas as “divisive and ineffective”. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, whose country has struggled to manage large numbers of refugees and migrants, criticised Tusk’s comments as “aimless, ill-timed and pointless”. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said there “cannot be selective solidarity” among EU member states”. Germany gave refuge to more than 1 million asylum seekers in 2015 and has been championing the policy of sharing refugees through quotas, when numbers could overwhelm other countries. “We need solidarity not just in regulating and steering migration,” Merkel said, “but we also need internal solidarity.” The row threatens to overshadow an EU summit insiders hoped would be a show of unity, with leaders launching landmark plans for greater military cooperation and basking in a common position on the first phase of Brexit talks. Only three countries – Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic – came out strongly in favour of Tusk’s plan ahead of the summit. The Czech Republic’s new prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said any attempt to impose “nonsensical” quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the EU. “It won’t happen.” Poland’s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he was happy that Poland’s opposition to allowing refugees into Europe seemed to be gaining acceptance. Poland, along with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, pledged €35m (£30m) for Italian-led projects to protect the border at Libya, as part of EU efforts to stem the flow of people attempting the dangerous journey to Europe. Speaking after the summit broke up, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he was happy with the contribution, but money was not enough. “This is what every country is doing. This cannot come in the place of, instead of being willing to take up your fair share in terms of the burden-sharing.” The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, welcomed the financial contribution but said the four countries still needed to accept refugees. “We will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.” Officials have been even blunter in private: one European diplomat told his counterparts that Tusk’s paper should be put in the bin. Another diplomatic source said it was badly written and “much too unbalanced in favour” of central Europe. However, another EU diplomat, from a country supporting quotas, said it was “time to attack the issue”, which was “starting to poison” other debates. “At this point in time, what I am expecting is a good old bust up and in a later phase we will narrow the field of possible outcomes.” The EU is not aiming to reach conclusions on this thorny issue at the summit. “Divisions are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find even a common language and rational arguments for this debate,” Tusk said, referring to the chasm of opinion on migration, but also the future of the single currency. EU leaders agreed on compulsory quotas at the height of the migration crisis in 2015, despite opposition from four central and eastern european countries. The bloc is discussing whether to make quotas a permanent feature of the EU’s asylum system, but the proposals have been making slow progress. The Tusk plan, reported by the Guardian earlier this week, took countries by surprise and is seen as out of step with months of work done by EU home affairs ministers. The European commission, backed by several member states, has also been infuriated by what it sees as a march on to its turf of proposing EU laws and policies. In his letter to leaders, Tusk said he would present “a way forward for consideration by leaders” after June 2018 if there was no consensus. “The European council [that Tusk leads] is not a legislative body,” said an EU diplomat. “I don’t think he can mean we should bypass our normal procedures.” The commission has also been irritated by Tusk’s claim that the 2015 quota system was a failure. “The commission firmly disagrees with the statement that relocation as an emergency response has been ‘ineffective’,” a spokeswoman said. “Over 32,000 people have been relocated – over 90% of all those eligible.” The commission said member states should be working towards a European approach. “Returning to a pre-crisis mode of isolated, uncoordinated, national action is not an option and would betray years’ worth of collective work to better the collective European response to managing migration.” The UK, which has an opt-out from this part of EU asylum policy, has been sitting on the sidelines of the debate and has never taken part in mandatory refugee relocation."
2017-07-31T18:12:37Z,France to provide water and open centres for refugees near Calais,"The French government has said it will provide water and sanitation to refugees and migrants in Calais and open two reception centres away from the port, hours after a court ordered it to end the inhuman treatment of migrants. France’s highest administrative court ruled that President Emmanuel Macron’s government and the Calais region must provide hundreds of refugees with drinking water, showers and toilets. The ruling came almost a year after the makeshift refugee camp in Calais, home to thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK, was bulldozed by French authorities. It was a setback for the local Calais authorities who had been taking a hard line with any new sign of settlements, discouraging charities from providing tents or food. Calais is still proving attractive to migrants searching a better life in the UK, although the numbers are significantly lower than last October and November when the camp was cleared. France’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, said there were about 350-400 refugees and migrants around Calais compared with 10,000 at the peak last year. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past but we also want to handle the problems in Calais,” Collomb said, indicating a determination to avoid providing facilities that could draw migrants to the town, making it once more a hub for those trying to reach Britain. A local court said this year that the authorities must provide access to water, prompting an appeal by the interior ministry and Calais commune. Rejecting that appeal, the Conseil d’État ruled that the treatment of migrants was inhuman. “The Conseil d’État considers that these living conditions reveal a failure by the public authorities that has exposed these people to inhuman or degrading treatment,” the court said in a statement. “These shortcomings are a serious and unlawful infringement on a fundamental freedom.” On Monday the court said the lower court was within its rights to order the provision of toilets, drinking water and showers. While Macron has called for migrants to be treated with dignity, his own government has taken a tough stance, refusing to open a new migrant reception centre in Calais, saying it would act as a magnet for other migrants. Last week, Human Rights Watch pressed France to end what it described as recurrent police violence against refugees and migrants in Calais, where hundreds have returned despite the demolition of the sprawling camp. The European Union is struggling to find a coherent answer to a migration crisis that has tested cooperation between member states. Macron has instructed his government to speed up France’s asylum process."
2017-08-28T05:00:25Z,Italian PM attends talks on migration after mass protest over Rome eviction,"Thousands of Italians have marched through Rome in support of the rights of refugees after clashes between migrants and police exposed rising hostility towards recent arrivals in the country. Italy is bearing the brunt of the European migration crisis, having seen almost 100,000 people arrive between January and June. Authorities are struggling to cope and efforts to promote integration have become strained. The prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, is due to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and counterparts from Spain and Germany, as well as leaders from Chad, Niger and Libya, on Monday for talks aimed at cutting illegal migration from Africa to Europe. The ongoing influx is deeply dividing Italy’s ruling centre-left Democratic party, while rightwing parties have seized on the issue as Italy prepares for a general election expected to be held before May 2018. In scenes that were widely condemned last week, police armed with batons fired water cannon at a group of around 100 refugees, mostly from Eritrea, who for several days had been camped out in a square in protest against their forced eviction from a nearby office building where they had been squatting. Some refugees hurled bottles, rocks and gas canisters as officers tried to clear the camp from the square near Rome’s central Termini station. “Unfortunately, these things happen ahead of elections,” Cécile Kyenge, an MEP and Italy’s former integration minister, told the Guardian. “In my opinion, good migrant reception needs to be a priority [in the campaign] – if reception and integration are done well, it would prevent conflicts like the one in Rome and benefit everyone. There are many examples of good integration in Italy, mostly in small towns, but there are also many examples of bad practice.” The refugees, many of whom had been granted asylum and who have jobs in Rome and children enrolled in schools there, were among a community of 800 who had been squatting in the six-storey building for five years. Authorities said they were evicted after refusing to accept alternative accommodation, and justified clearing the camp by pointing to the risks posed by the gas canisters the squatters had been using for stoves, in an area surrounded by residential buildings. Human rights advocates and the UN refugee agency protested that the eviction had been conducted without warning. Many asylum seekers sleep on the streets of Rome for lack of housing. On Saturday, thousands of asylum seekers, other migrants and supporters marched through the Italian capital carrying banners saying “refugees not terrorists”, calling for evictions to be halted and for refugees to be properly housed. As images of last week’s clashes spread across the world, Rome’s city council, which is led by the populist Five Star Movement, relented on Friday and allowed a group of 40 elderly, sick and young refugees to return to the building for six months after brokering a deal with SEA, the company that owns the block. The interior ministry is now reportedly drafting new guidelines stipulating that any future evictions must include relocation proposals for the most vulnerable. But the incident has highlighted the fact that 200,000 people are currently housed in state-run shelters as they await asylum applications. Disillusioned by their government’s inability to manage the situation, some Italians are also beginning to revolt. “If you look at the comments on news sites or on Facebook in response to what happened in Rome, you see that people are very passionate about migration and were mostly in favour of the police,” said Giovanni Orsina, a professor of political science at Rome’s Luiss University. Though the numbers of people arriving in Italy by sea fell in July – stymied by a crackdown on NGO search and rescue ships operating off the coast of Libya in the Mediterranean – around 140,000 migrants are projected to reach the country by the end of the year. In what was seen as a final political litmus test ahead of next year’s general elections, centre-right parties scored victories in local elections in June. The centre-right triumphed in mayoral votes in 15 of the largest cities, including Verona, Monza, Piacenza and the border town of Como, where migrants prevented from entering Switzerland have been sleeping rough in parks and outside the train station. Last week in the Tuscan town of Pistoia, which in June elected its first rightwing mayor since the second world war, a priest sparked controversy merely by taking a group of migrants to a local swimming pool. Members of the far-right Forza Nuova party said on Friday that they would “control” this week’s Sunday mass in retaliation. The biggest surprise of the June elections was in Lampedusa, the Sicilian island that has been at the centre of the migration crisis. The Unesco peace prize-winning former mayor Giusi Nicolini resoundingly lost to Salvatore Martello, a hotel owner who ran independently from Italy’s main parties and who said he “cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere”. Daniela DeBono, a research fellow and senior lecturer at the European University Institute and Malmö University, said Italians were mostly frustrated at “the outcome of the gross mismanagement of the secondary reception system”. “Asylum processes can take up to three years, integration programmes are poor and then, of course, migrants are frustrated and are not allowed to be autonomous …that is quite rightly bothering Italians, especially bearing in mind the high rates of unemployment and precariousness at work,” she said. Orsina said: “People can’t stand this situation any longer, they don’t perceive it as something that is being well-governed. It’s beyond racism and fear – Italians might even allow half a million more migrants in, but they want to be able to decide rather than have it imposed on them.”"
2017-12-17T20:50:03Z,"Nepali migrant workers ‘systematically’ exploited, Amnesty says","Nepali migrant workers continue to be trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation, according to new research by Amnesty International. A survey by Amnesty has found two-thirds of migrant workers have paid excessive or illegal recruitment fees. The phone survey of 414 Nepali migrant workers found 88% paid fees to agents for their jobs overseas. The fees were claimed to be so high that the majority had to borrow more than half the sum from village moneylenders, placing them in debt. More than half of the workers surveyed – 53% – said they received lower monthly salaries than was promised to them by recruitment agents. James Lynch, the deputy director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme, said: “Nepali migrant workers are being systematically and mercilessly set up. Forced to take out loans to pay the huge fees recruitment agencies charge them to work abroad, they are left so indebted they have no choice but to stay in jobs which often turn out to be low paid or dangerous. “The Nepali government’s weak enforcement of the law is playing straight into the hands of extortionists and loan sharks,” he said. “Migrant workers all too often end up trapped in a soul-destroying situation of working abroad for years simply to pay off huge, often illegal fees they were charged to take the job. Tackling this exploitative industry is a matter of urgency.”"
2017-12-24T08:00:45Z,The refugees who brought hope to a Scottish island,"A star has settled over a Scottish island this Christmas and once more people from the east are bearing gifts. Just before Christmas 2015, Bute, an archipelago off the west coast of Scotland in the Firth of Clyde, opened its doors uncertainly to a battered group of 24 Syrian families fleeing the daily threat of death and persecution. Many among Bute’s 6,500 people were eager to welcome those who had endured horror. In some places the reception was chillier. This reaction was fuelled by a degree of suspicion and resentment and given further oxygen by some media coverage which sought to sow fear and foment division. The editor of the local newspaper, The Buteman, was so appalled by the tone of some of his readers’ comments that he felt he had to face them head-on in a hard-hitting editorial. “Mostly, these are just not-very-thinly veiled ways of people saying ‘I don’t want them in my backyard’. Well, I do,” wrote Craig Borland back then. “I want Bute to be a place where people who come here with little more than the clothes they are standing in can feel safe and at home.” Borland has since departed the editor’s chair, but he will be delighted to know that his Christmas wish of 2015 has been granted: these Syrian families are indeed safe and they feel at home. This gruff and unsentimental little community now holds them close to its heart. The Syrian arrivals, in turn, feel that they belong here and are eager to repay the kindness they have encountered. Two years ago Angela Callaghan formed part of reception committee on the island to help the refugees settle and feel welcome. She runs Bute Oasis, a gift and secondhand furniture shop which she uses to fund a food bank. Two years ago she expressed optimism that the Syrian families’ experience of Bute would be a happy one. “These people will become part of our community and will not have much time when they arrive to organise meals. I know what it’s like, and it’ll be no different for them, so we’ll all rally round,” she said then. This Christmas she is organising more than 100 food boxes for local and Syrian families alike and has given them all a little festive flourish. On Friday afternoon I find her as I had left her two years ago: organising the delivery of the boxes. Helping her to distribute them are two young Syrians, Ahmas Fars and Bissam Midani. “They just feel that they want to put something back into the community,” says Callaghan. “They help out here and on the counter in the shop, and the locals love them.” Her two Syrian helpers now have their driving licences, which they obtained after taking their tests in Ireland, which offers the theory part of the test in Arabic. “The Syrian families have all settled well here and the community regards them as their own,” she says. “And that includes some of those who were less inclined to be welcoming when they first came here. We have lots of wee Syrian children running around with broad Scottish accents. Now I pop in and out of their homes for dinner and cups of tea. “I’m not saying there weren’t some difficulties initially. I noticed that three of the children were struggling. There was fear and anger. But over the course of a few months you could see the tension leaving their eyes, and whereas once they would be telling you to back off, now they just want to give you hugs.” She tells the story of a child who became hysterical with fear when she saw a helicopter approaching the island – in Syria the approach of a helicopter was an apocalyptic event bringing bombs and death. One of Bute’s success stories is that of Mohannad Helmi, who arrived 10 months ago with his wife Raghad al Barkawi, their four-year-old son Naeem and daughter Qamar, aged 18 months. Some members of his extended family are also here. Within a short space of time the couple have made their modest house a warm and loving home. When I visit, Qamar is watching an Arabic children’s TV channel and playing peek-a-boo with me behind her hands. Her parents are beginning to pick up English, and tell me that Naeem now not only speaks it fluently but thinks in his new language too. “We are very happy here,” says Helmi. “We have been shown nothing but friendliness and affection since the day we arrived. It seems that everyone smiles at us when we go to the shops or go out for a walk. Everyone waves at us. My aim is to learn English fluently and to then find a job.” He doesn’t feel he will be returning to Syria in the immediate future, although when he speaks about his homeland, pain comes into his eyes. The family fled Darayya, a suburb of Damascus, after it was levelled by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad as they targeted rebels. As no food was getting in, people faced death by bombing or starvation. “In Syria I was a professional printer and I’d like to practise that in Scotland after my English has improved sufficiently,” says Helmi. “I also want to put something back into this community. People have been so kind, and we now regard this as our home from home. One day, God willing, we may return to Syria but we know that it won’t be the same country that we left. And if we do, we will leave a big part of our heart in Scotland.” His wife, a woman clearly very much in love with her husband, disappears in and out of the kitchen bringing coffee and cake. You gain a sense that they have discovered happiness again and a degree of security in their lives. You also sense that this may be the first time in their marriage that they have encountered a measure of tranquillity and peace. Much of their happiness, it seems, derives from the fact that their children have now found a place where they can be safe and discover the simple joy of playing without fear. “We do feel very safe here and very much cared for,” says Helmi. “It is a lovely place to bring up our children and it’s wonderful to see them happy and safe.” He doesn’t go into details of the circumstances of their flight from Damascus, but it’s obvious that both the couple and their children were in danger every day they spent there. They smile and laugh a lot and tell me that there is now an unbreakable bond between this unfussy Scottish island and the ancient nation of Syria. Argyll and Bute Council is also delighted with the way the Syrian families have settled – but more especially with the manner in which they have been taken to the heart of the community. A vocal scarecrow faction had tried to stir up suspicion and to organise a backlash, but they were repelled as a sense of Scottish decency and goodwill prevailed. There are still remnants of unpleasantness, but those who espouse it are very much a minority in the community. The refugee families are living in spare capacity housing, and nobody’s way of life or entitlements has been adversely affected. The only moment of jeopardy came when some media outlets released the name of a suspect in the London bombing along with a photograph of him aboard the Bute ferry. He was very quickly released without charge but a minor frenzy erupted about Isis bombers hiding among refugees. The furore rapidly receded. Graeme Murdoch, a photographer and designer who lived on Bute for a few years, said: “The Syrian families arrived on Bute not long after I pitched up on the isle, and one of my thoughts was: ‘Ah, one of them might open a decent restaurant in Rothesay.’ I met many of them during my time there and found a generosity of spirit, despite all that they had suffered, which initially wasn’t returned by very many. “Gradually though, friendships began to develop, and one of the most supportive was Aidan Canavan at Bute Brew, the local micro-brewery; how ironic that they could never sample his joyous nectar because they don’t drink alcohol. I’m so glad that most of the families have stayed. The island community is better for it.” The council leader, Aileen Morton, said: “The Syrian refugee resettlement programme has been a great success, both for Bute and for the families involved. It’s heartening to see families settling and growing in the community to the benefit of all. But from day one this programme has been about helping families in desperate need to build secure lives; it’s been about helping people fleeing trauma to feel safe, and I am delighted that they now feel able to refer to Bute as their home.” The role of Rothesay joint campus primary and secondary school has been crucial in the process of integration. The school has always played an active role in this community, and it is here that the Syrian children will encounter the values that the community seeks to foster. I was told by more than one islander that all the children are now regarded as Scots, and that they are entirely comfortable in the accelerated west of Scotland genre of the English language. One of the older Syrian boys has become a captain of one of the school houses and recently delivered a speech in front of the entire campus. Mounzer al-Darsani was a barber for 15 years in Damascus before fleeing with his family to Bute. He was a well-known character in the city, and his shop, the Orient Salon, was always busy. Earlier this year the Orient Salon rose from the ashes of Damascus and was born again under the same name on Bute. It seems his Rothesay business is now thriving as much as his Damascus one did. It was his dream to be open for business again in Bute, but he knew he first had to conquer the English language. “Immediately after I came here I studied English for five hours every night in my own home, and after six months I felt I was beginning to pick it up,” he says. “The locals have been very helpful. They sensed I was keen to learn and were very patient and helped me out when I got words or sentences wrong. “I love it here. My family have been made to feel very welcome. This is a safe place and that is important. I also volunteer at the Rothesay festival and at the food bank because it’s my way of saying thank you to the people of Bute for having us here and for coming to our aid and showing mercy in our darkest times.” Three years ago, Bute organised a public meeting to solicit views on how this formerly grand, but now struggling, place might be revived. According to the 2011 census its population had declined by 10% in the previous decade. Its formerly magnificent esplanade once thrummed with the feet and voices of several thousand Glaswegians – a summer bonanza which helped to sustain it for the rest of the year. Now almost every other shop space along the front is an empty one. But as well as the Orient Salon, a Syrian bakery and patisserie will soon open. The Syrian people fleeing terror have possibly brought with them the miracle of life for Bute. A small regeneration is taking place on the island. Four new babies have been born to the Syrian families and another is on the way. In their own way they are bringing optimism to a west of Scotland community that had almost forgotten what it meant. REFUGEES IN NUMBERS 11m Number of Syrians who have fled their homes since the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011. 3.3m Turkey hosts the largest number of registered Syrian refugees – 3.3 million – while Lebanon hosts 1.1m, and Jordan 660,000. 6.6m Number of people internally displaced in Syria. 1m About one million Syrian refugees have requested asylum in Europe. Germany, with more than 300,000 applications, and Sweden with 100,000, are the EU’s top receiving countries. 9,394 Syrian refugees resettled in Britain, in spite of support for greater numbers.

2017-11-16T13:14:42Z,"Teenage Nigerian girls drowned at sea, Italian autopsies confirm","Autopsies on the bodies of 26 Nigerian teenage girls recovered from the Mediterranean this month have confirmed that they drowned. The bodies of the girls, aged between 14 and 18, were brought to the southern Italian port of Salerno by the Spanish ship Cantabria on 5 November. An investigation was opened due to fears they may have been abused and killed. But Prof Antonello Crisci, a medic who worked on the postmortems, said the girls died from drowning after the dinghies they were travelling in sank. “There were no signs that they had been raped or physically abused,” he said. “They most likely couldn’t swim.” The bodies were recovered by Cantabria, which works as part of the EU’s Sophia anti-trafficking operation, from two shipwrecks – 23 from one and three from the other. One of the women also suffered a “hemorrhagic shock” due to a liver wound, and two were pregnant, the doctor added. At least 100 other migrants who were also attempting the treacherous crossing from Libya to Europe are missing and almost certain to have drowned, prosecutors said on Wednesday. A further 375 people were brought to safety across two search-and-rescue missions. Two men, who were among the survivors and are believed to have skippered one of the boats, were arrested in Salerno the day after the bodies were brought to the port on charges of people trafficking. Marco Rotunno, an Italy spokesman for the UN refugee agency, told the Guardian last week that 90% of migrant and refugee women arrive in the country with bruises or other signs of violence. People continue to attempt the crossing despite a pact between Italy and Libya to stem the flow, which led to a near 70% drop in arrivals since the summer, according to figures released this month by Italy’s interior ministry. Italy defended the agreement on Wednesday after it was lambasted by the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, as being “inhuman”. Rights groups have denounced the policy, saying it exposes returned migrants to Libya’s lawless detention centres with no legal recourse. There have long been reports of the horrific abuses suffered by migrants in war-stricken Libya at the hands of traffickers and others, with the International Organisation for Migration saying in April that thousands of Africans are being sold in “slave markets”. “The suffering of migrants detained in Libya is an outrage to the conscience of humanity,” Hussein said in a statement issued on Tuesday. “The European Union’s policy of assisting the Libyan coastguard to intercept and return migrants in the Mediterranean [is] inhuman.” Italy’s interior minister, Marco Minniti, defended the deal, saying: “The alternative cannot be to resign ourselves to the impossibility of managing migratory flows and hand human traffickers the keys to European democracies. “We invite all those who are giving lessons to instead give more funds, more logistical support and more intervention in Libya to solve this issue.”"
2017-12-06T09:55:35Z,Greek refugee camps 'beyond desperate' as islanders protest in Athens,"Humanitarian groups have warned of a looming emergency on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands, the day after residents converged on Athens in protest at policies that have led to thousands of migrants and refugees being marooned in reception centres. A surge in arrivals from neighbouring Turkey has seen numbers soar with officials speaking of a four-fold increase in men, women and children seeking asylum on Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos. Conditions are deteriorating in the vastly overcrowded camps in a situation that Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on Wednesday warned was “beyond desperate”. “In Lesbos, entire families who recently arrived from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are packed into small summer tents, under the rain and in low temperatures struggling to keep dry and warm,” said Aria Danika, MSF’s project coordinator on the island. “In our mental health clinic we have received an average of 10 patients with acute mental distress every day, including many who tried to kill themselves or self-harm. The situation on the island was already terrible. Now it’s beyond desperate.” Demonstrators – led by delegations of officials from Chios, Lesbos and Samos – gathered in the Athens sunshine on Tuesday to demand that the government move people out of camps. “Action has to be taken now, before it is too late,” said Panos Pitsios, president of the town council of Mytilene, Lesbos’s capital. “We are heading towards an eruption, a situation that is on the verge of getting out of control.” The island, the gateway for an estimated 800,000 refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the refugee crisis two years ago, is now housing more than 7,000 people in facilities with a capacity of 2,300. The strategy of stranding migrants and refugees in remote camps where tensions have also mounted between rival ethnicities has also been condemned by human rights groups. Organisations increasingly fear that unless asylum seekers are transferred to the mainland where facilities are less crowded and better equipped, thousands could be left out in the cold as winter approaches. As of last week, reception centres on the isles were almost 7,200 over capacity, condemning inmates to live in appalling conditions with lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities and health services. Mayors from all five islands said in a proclamation handed to the migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, that Athens’ containment policies had turned their communities into “island prisons”. “There has to be immediate decongestion of the islands,” Chios’s mayor, Manolis Vournous, told the Guardian. “There simply isn’t the infrastructure to cope.” About 2,500 people, he said, were currently stuck in Vial, the island’s main camp, purpose-built to hold no more than 800. “It is an intolerable situation that is putting human lives at risk and endangering social cohesion. It has to end.” The leftist-led Greek government argues it is hamstrung by a landmark accord reached between the EU and Turkey to stem the flows last year. Under the agreement, asylum seekers arriving on Greek islands must remain in situ until their requests are approved – a process made longer by a notoriously slow-moving justice system that has been impacted by the country’s long-running economic crisis. The enforced wait is exacerbated by the spectre that, if rejected, asylum seekers will be forcibly returned to Turkey. In recent weeks, prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s administration has taken steps to alleviate the situation – transferring hundreds of migrants by ship to Athens. Mouzalas recently announced that the government was also considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. But with more than 15,000 people officially registered in state-run camps on the isles, the measures were described as “hopelessly inadequate” by locals. “More than a third of Mytilene’s total population are migrants and refugees,” said Pitsios. “Residents are afraid at night to even leave their homes and now they are at the end of their tether.”"
2017-11-08T18:33:48Z,Migrants only cross borders as last resort | Letters,"You are right that migrants attempt the journey to Europe even though they know the risks (They know the risks and still they come: why young Africans chase the European dream, theguardian.com, 6 November). This is because they have no choice, and there are not enough safe and legal routes available. They are fleeing persecution, abuse and poverty and migrating is a last resort for the majority. Our new report released this week based on interviews with 67 Eritreans shows that the joint EU-Africa policy intended to help migrants and refugees, known as the Khartoum Process, is in fact part of the problem. It pushes the problem offshore and creates risks for vulnerable people. Our findings show that people decide to cross borders irregularly and take extreme risks when alternative options are perceived to be equally bad, or worse. What policy makers view as an ill-informed decision is often calculated risk-taking. Most of those fleeing persecution, human rights abuses, conflict and poverty are not even attempting to get to Europe and remain in the region. We argue that a new approach is needed – one in which there is a shift in focus on to the political context in which migration takes place, rather than the criminality that it attracts. Tackling the symptoms rather than the causes of migration will do little to change the current equation in which people take considerable risks for want of alternatives.

2017-11-03T17:11:42Z,Europe’s top human rights job deserves better. We urge Greece to choose again | Kostis Papaioannou and Vassilis Papadopoulos,"The Greek government’s decision to put forward its current minister of migration as a candidate for Europe’s top human rights job must seem reasonable to many people outside Greece. Our country was forced to deal with record arrivals of refugees at a time when it is already struggling to emerge from a serious financial crisis. The humanity displayed by many Greeks in responding to these twin crises has earned the country the moral right to be heard. But the nomination of Ioannis Mouzalas for Human Rights Commissioner at the Council of Europe has caused serious concern in Greece itself. His term as migration minister is not one that has promoted respect for human rights. The choice of this commissioner is of particular importance because the role oversees human rights conditions and detects problems in law and administrative practice; it also proposes recommendations and follows up on their implementation. The commissioner must act according to the basic principles of the Council of Europe, an institutional pillar for the protection of human rights. The incumbent, Nils Muiznieks, has expressed serious concern about the deal struck between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to stem the flow of Syrian refugees into Greece, in which aid and political concessions were offered to Ankara. The Greek minister, on the contrary, has been one of the most ardent protectors of this controversial agreement. He has insisted on implementation of the deal and refused any input from national and international stakeholders regarding its impact on human rights. In cases where the EU-Turkey deal has not been implemented fully, and no Syrian refugee has been forcibly returned to Turkey, this is because of the determined resistance of civil society organisations as well as public servants. When the independent committees that decide asylum appeal claims in Greece ruled in favour of claimants who were resisting being sent back to Turkey, Mouzalas was accused of intervening to influence their decisions. When this did not work, he amended the law to change the composition of the committees and speed up the return of Syrians to Turkey. This interference directly contradicted the principles of the Council of Europe – the very body in which he is now a candidate for a senior role. The minister’s support for the EU Turkey deal should at least have triggered unease about nominating him for a top institutional position. Especially one that implies an unwavering stance in support of human rights in general, and respect for the rights of refugees in particular. We presume that consistency with the principles of the Council of Europe will be taken into account when the nominees are considered. Far from there being positive work leading to his nomination, there is, unfortunately, plenty of evidence of the opposite. Multiple reports from Greek and international organisations, including an investigation in the Guardian, have raised very serious reservations about the management of the refugee issue. The EU policy, backed by the Greek government, has led to thousands of refugees and migrants being trapped in unacceptable conditions on the Greek islands. Last winter this confinement to the islands and mismanagement led to the loss of life. There has been no meaningful investigation to establish responsibility for these deaths. The failure to provide adequate camp facilities or the structures and rules needed to properly administer the refugee population belongs in part to Mouzalas. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, among others, has already warned about the danger of a repeat of similar failings this winter. The policy supported by Mouzalas has also placed an unreasonable burden on local communities on the islands where new arrivals are confined. This was done without any planning or attempts to gain local support and has resulted in a serious risk of social and political unrest. This agreement is becoming a paradigm on how to undermine the post-second world war refugee protection apparatus. Its strict implementation has badly damaged the rule of law. Even if Greece had no choice but to accept the EU-Turkey deal, what we have managed is the worst possible version: entrapping and dehumanising asylum seekers in a punitive way beyond what the deal formally envisioned. We often criticize the negative political stance of central European countries that target refugees and do not take their share of responsibility as EU members. But for this criticism to be essential, we ought to contrast it with our own politics. It is clear that the Greek government should think again on its decision to propose Mouzalas as a candidate for human rights commissioner at the Council of Europe. • Kostis Papaioannou is the former secretary general for human rights in the Greek government.

2017-11-22T16:36:09Z,Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies spotted in the UK,"Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies have been spotted in the UK this year, according to an analysis by volunteers from the Migrant Dragonfly Project. The study recorded the first confirmed UK sighting of the scarlet darter for 13 years, at Longham Lakes in Dorset. It is only the eighth time this species has been spotted in Britain. Volunteers also recorded the second largest ever immigration of red-veined darters into the UK, and there have been multiple influxes of both vagrant emperor and lesser emperor dragonflies. Eleanor Colver, conservation officer for the British Dragonfly Society, said: “we are currently seeing major shifts in the range of dragonfly species on a global scale, not just in the UK.” She added: “Dragonflies, like all insects, cannot regulate their body temperature like humans, so are highly sensitive to small changes in environmental temperature. As a result, we believe that some of the changes we are witnessing in our local dragonflies are their response to the ongoing global warming.” Adrian Parr, co-ordinator of the Migrant Dragonfly Project, said the record number in the UK was helped by warm weather and southerly winds in spring and early summer as well as good breeding conditions in the traditional dragonfly homelands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Unlike the situation with birds, whose migrations are well-known, our understanding of insect (and particularly dragonfly) migration is still in its infancy,” said Parr. “It is clearly, however, an important phenomenon, and one that tells us a lot about the living world.” Parr said scarlet darters are usually found across central Europe, Africa, the Middle East and western Asia and that they are “one of the most generalist dragonfly species, able to live in a variety of standing-water habitats, ranging from brackish pools to freshwater ditches.” According to the project, Britain has been colonised by four new species of dragonfly in the past 20 years, including the willow emerald damselfly and small red-eyed damselfly, and seen the return of the dainty damselfly, which had last been seen in 1953."
2017-12-26T11:00:46Z,Desperate plight of Rohingya refugees hits home in Bradford,"It took the best part of 36 hours to travel from his Victorian terrace home in Bradford to the ever-growing refugee camp in southern Bangladesh. But of the 5,000 mile trip it was the final few hundred metres that were the hardest. “When I was 500 metres from my parents home I was crying loudly,” said Deen Mohammed Noori. The 32-year-old had been reunited with his parents after nine years; their address is printed in black ink on official UN records: Kutupalong, Block D, Shed 0026. Noori’s parents are among hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees living in what has rapidly become the world’s largest refugee camp, with nearly 1 million stateless people living in makeshift settlements on the edge of Kutupalong, near Cox’s Bazar. For Noori, the bamboo and tarpaulin huts are a reminder of the life he was fortunate enough to escape in 2010, when he was among 199 Rohingya refugees who settled in Bradford under the International Organisation for Migration’s gateway protection programme. The Bradford Rohingyas, the biggest community of the ethnic group in Europe, have watched with increasing horror as more than 670,000 of their ethnic group – often described as the “world’s most persecuted people” – have fled the destruction of their villages in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Noori now works as a taxi driver in Bradford while running the Arakan Rohingya Organisation UK from his family home in the centre of the city, where he lives with his wife and children. He returned from his four-week trip to Kutupalong on 30 November with graphic horror stories and a renewed determination to ask the British government for sanctuary for his elderly relatives. “My mum didn’t want me to come back here. I wanted to bring my parents with me. Why can’t I take them with with me to the country where I live? It was a sad moment for me when I was coming back to the airport,” he said. “Every time we go out ... we feel sad all the time. We feel disappointed because my parents are not here.” The city council has given the Rohingya community a small office in a community centre in the Laisterdyke neighbourhood of east Bradford, where they can meet and organise. In October, Nijam Uddin Mohammed, general secretary of the British Rohingya Community UK, and nine others took aid to desperate families in Kutupalong, donating food, firewood and medicine from the people of Bradford. Although the vast majority of Rohingya refugees are Muslim, the donations came from every faith and none, said Mohammed. “Donations came from all over Bradford regardless of faith. We’ve been very surprised: the mosques, churches, temples – everyone has come out to help us.” Nur Huda, chairman of the British Rohingya Community UK, took his 11-year-old daughter, Nurun Nessa Sumai, on the 5,000-mile journey to the country where they had lived in exile until 2008, when they were among the first Rohingya refugees to be welcomed to Bradford under its City of Sanctuary scheme. Sumai, who started secondary school in September at Bradford’s Feversham college for girls, said she had returned to Yorkshire with a new appreciation for the most basic things in life. “Here [children] take everything for granted, and they [children in Kutupalong] are just hoping they have parents, proper education, nice food, nice clothes and everything, good toys to play with, find friends and all the things we take for granted today,” she said. “We get water, they don’t have that much clean water. They don’t have anything – they have to sleep on the streets. They never know if someone’s going to trip over them or anything. They’re just lying there hoping that something good will happen to them, but they don’t have much hope now.” Of all the distressing sights and stories in Kutupalong, Mohammed said, it was the plight of the children that raised the greatest alarm. More than 600,000 Rohingya children are at risk in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to Unicef, which estimates that almost 60% of the nearly 1 million people to have fled the violence are children – and 21% of those under five are malnurished. Mohammed, who grew up in Kutupalong, said he feared the lack of education was the greatest threat to the future of his people. Fewer than 1% of 720,000 children classed as “in need” are currently receiving any form of education, according to Unicef. “Nearly 1 million people, their children are without education. What are these children’s destinations going to be? “Sometimes you kill people with weapons. This time, if children are away from education, then my Rohingya nation will be completely disappeared slowly,” he said."
2017-08-21T17:04:28Z,Pope Francis: prioritise migrants' dignity over national security,"Pope Francis has issued a 20-point action plan to governments on refugees and migrants to try to galvanise their response to an issue seen by the Vatican as one of the biggest global challenges of the 21st century. His intention is to lay the ground for the drafting of two global compacts on refugees and migration, which are expected to be adopted at the UN general assembly in September 2018. The roadmap was published on Monday by the Vatican’s migrants and refugees section, which was set up by Francis last year and operates under his direction. The action points were personally approved by the pontiff. In a message issued before publication, Francis said he had “repeatedly expressed my particular concern for the lamentable situation of many migrants and refugees fleeing from war, persecution, natural disasters and poverty”. The situation was “undoubtedly a ‘sign of the times’,” he said. The document, Responding to Refugees and Migrants: Twenty Action Points, says the world is facing “the largest movement of displaced people in recent memory”. It says: “While massive numbers of people have been forced to leave their homes due to persecution, violence, natural disasters and the scourge of poverty, migration should nevertheless be recognised, not as a new phenomenon, but rather as a natural human response to crisis and a testament to the innate desire of every human being for happiness and a better life. “This reality, with its important cultural and spiritual dimensions, is having a significant impact on attitudes and reactions all over the world.” The document’s 20 points are grouped in four calls to action: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate. Their “ultimate goal is the building of an inclusive and sustainable common home for all”. Before detailing the action plan, the authors suggest that distinguishing between migrants and refugees, as the UN does in its separate compacts, is problematic. “Empirical evidence shows that migration is more and more mixed. This makes it difficult to maintain a clear-cut distinction between migrants and refugees. Often their needs are very similar if not identical,” the document says. Among its action points are the creation of legal pathways for safe and voluntary migration and resettlement, and a ban on arbitrary and collective expulsions. It suggests states make wider use of humanitarian, student and family reunification visas. The document says greater support should be available for countries that have borne the brunt of migration: more than half the world’s displaced people are in Africa and the Middle East, with 17% in Europe, according to the UN. In his message, Francis said personal safety and dignity should be prioritised over national security and, “for the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorisation”. Francis has indicated that migration should be a major Vatican focus in the run-up to the 2018 UN general assembly. He has made the issue central to his papacy since visiting the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, where thousands of migrants have landed, within weeks of his election. He has also housed several Syrian refugee families in the Vatican. Graham Gordon, of the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “The Holy Father is making clear that all countries must step up to the plate and pull their weight. “This is one of the greatest crises of the century so far. Not for the first time, the pope is reminding politicians that history will judge whether they rise to the challenge or abdicate their responsibility.” Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s anti-immigrant Northern League party, wrote on Facebook: “If you want to do it in the Vatican, go ahead. But as a Catholic, I don’t think Italy can welcome and support the whole world.”"
2017-07-24T04:00:26Z,European and African ministers discuss plan to tackle flow of refugees,"European and African ministers are to meet in Tunis on Monday to discuss a plan to try to regularise the flow of refugees from Africa to Europe to about 20,000, coupled with a much tougher strategy to deport illegal migrants from Italy and break up smuggling rings. The plan to regularise the migrant flow is being pushed by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, which warns that EU efforts to train the Libyan coastguard along with Italy’s intention to impose a new code of conduct on NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean do not match the scale of the problem, or recognise the extent to which the flow of refugees and migrants is likely to become permanent. The aim is to set up screening systems for EU-bound migrants in countries en route to Libya, such as Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Chad and Sudan. The EU at a meeting in July set aside enough cash for 40,000 regularised refugees, with as many as half coming from claimants in Syria, and the remainder from Africa. Although the European commission has struggled to persuade all countries to take migrants after a similar scheme set up in following the 2015 migration crisis from Syria, the new scheme would represent a form of solidarity, and provide Italy with some relief. Italy is gripped by deep political and civil divisions on the issue, with more than 90,000 migrants reaching Italy from Libya this year. A reduction to 20,000 from Africa would represent a transformation. Explaining the thinking, Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s new special envoy to the central Mediterranean, said: “We need to regularise the system and stop these dangerous journeys into Libya. Any remedy that focuses on trying to stop the flow of migrants at sea, such as a code of conduct for a NGOs, cannot be the solution. The issue has to be addressed earlier in the countries of origin and transit. “Italy also needs to be able to process claimants so the economic migrants are returned much more quickly, or else there will be no deterrent to travel to Italy. Only a third of the migrants reaching Italy are found to be in need of international protection.” He added that by the time migrants reached Libya it was often too late. It is thought there are 300,000 Africans from outside Libya trying to get across to Europe or to get some work in Libya. They are living in Libyan detention centres or in warehouses or so-called “connection houses” in the hands of traffickers. The refugees need to be taken out of Libya and these detention centres so they can be processed elsewhere. He added: “There has been a lot of rhetoric about closing down the smugglers’ business model, but little has happened, but it has to be done more seriously than at present … Many of the people smugglers can be identified as they advertise their services on Facebook, but little has been done to try to seize their assets or impose travel bans and other sanctions. “There tends to be action against the small fry, like the people that steer the boats to Libya in return for a discount on the journey. They are not the people responsible for this system.” UNHCR recognises that it is necessary to train and capacitate the Libyan coastguards, but there is also a need to prevent human rights abuses and to investigate incidents of collusion with traffickers. In the first six months of this year, 2,171 refugees and migrants died or went missing in the central Mediterranean, and many others are believed to have died trying to cross into Libya."
2017-12-17T12:56:12Z,The Jungle review – devastating yet uplifting story of the migrant crisis,"‘How did you survive?” asks a young British volunteer of a refugee in the migrant camp that sprang up out of the mud like a small city near Calais. “We didn’t,” comes the reply. “We are different now.” The migrant camp known as the Jungle housed thousands of refugees and hundreds of unaccompanied minors from 2015 until it was bulldozed in late 2016. The journey to Calais was always a long and difficult one for everyone who came, and there were many kinds of death along the way. Yet these living ghosts are vibrant and vivid, full of life and resilience in this teeming play written by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, the founders of Good Chance, a theatre company that sprang up in the camp alongside the shops, the school and the Afghan restaurant run by Salar (Ben Turner). The late AA Gill paid a visit and reviewed it favourably. Miriam Buether’s design places the audience in the restaurant, a ramshackle place of plywood tables, ill-matching chairs and benches, and a patchwork roof fashioned from flimsy material. Bread is handed around: even amid the arguments and disagreements, the struggle to survive from day to day, the hopes raised and dashed over and over, there is always bread and hospitality. When Sam (Alex Lawther), an 18-year-old posh boy, arrives at the camp, he describes it as “Glastonbury without the toilets”. Only, after Glastonbury everybody goes home. The people in the Jungle are looking for a permanent home, preferably in the UK. Everyone, it seems, has an uncle in Leicester. One teenager gives a demonstration of the ringtone on his phone: the melody of The White Cliffs of Dover curls across the theatre and has never sounded so melancholy. Many of the young men never miss the weekly phone call to their mothers in Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria or Eritrea, but they lie to them and tell them they are already in the UK, in school or at work, finding it unbearable to admit that they are caught in the purgatory of the camp looking for “the good chance” as a stowaway in a lorry or on Eurostar that will take them to the promised land. Whenever there is a traffic jam on the motorway, the restaurant suddenly empties. If someone does make it to England and gets word back, a cry of joy goes up all around the camp. Too often the attempt ends in interment in the mud in Angel’s Corner, the camp’s burial ground. Like the Afghan restaurant and the camp itself, Murphy and Robertson’s play, delicately directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, in a co-production by the Young Vic, the National Theatre and Good Chance, has a makeshift quality. That always operates in its favour. It never sets itself up as a definitive story about the camp. There is nothing neat and tidy about the Jungle or the way human beings behave under pressure or what motivates an individual’s actions. The emotions are always big, because the stakes are so high. The story begins at the end and then snakes back on itself, told by a 35-year-old Syrian, Salfi (Ammar Haj Ahmed), a former English literature student from Aleppo, whose quiet affability disguises his increasing desperation. It’s not a sophisticated piece of theatre, but it is an extraordinarily effective one. Characters are lightly but vividly drawn and full of complexity. There is Okot (John Pfumojena), the 17-year-old whose journey from Sudan has left many different kinds of scar; the Afghan teenager Norullah (Mohammad Amiri), who becomes crazed by his desire to get to England, and Helene (Nahel Tzegai), a woman who can calm the fractious men, and is working towards her own decision about what is best for her and her family. The British volunteers, many of whom turn up following photographs in the media of Alan Kurdi, the little Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach, are no less complicated in the reasons why they have come, and how they behave while they are there. Everyone is changed, particularly Sam. This is not a play that judges individuals but one that holds governments to account. The British and French authorities are shown not just failing to help, but turning their backs on a humanitarian catastrophe. Theresa May, then home secretary, comes in for particular opprobrium for her attempts to circumvent the right of unaccompanied minors living in the camp who have relatives in the UK from exercising it. A small, silent girl, Amal (Aliya Ali), haunts the action, as if representing all the lost children who never made it even to Calais, all the futures denied and dreams crushed. This devastating, uplifting show is beady-eyed even as it celebrates the human capacity to build something out of nothing, to work together and try to make a difference. Good Chance – returning to France in January to set up a theatre in a migrant centre in the north of Paris – is doing just that. Let’s listen and learn. At the Young Vic, London, until 9 January. Box office: 020-7922 2922."
2017-12-16T10:17:02Z,Domestic violence: still a hidden problem for many migrant women,"With no family support, no friends, no finance, no confidence, and often feeling isolated, many migrant women feel totally alone and do not know where to go for help. One woman who came without her husband’s permission to a workshop I ran on domestic abuse told me she was not allowed to go out on her own, even to buy food for her three-year-old son. She had to wait for her husband to come back from work and go with him. This woman said her husband would punish her if he found out she had attended the workshop. She felt she had no choice but to accept the situation because he had sponsored her visa; if she didn’t do what he said, he could send her home. It is shocking that almost 2 million people a year in England and Wales – 1.2 million women and 713,000 men – experience domestic abuse, and that two women in England are killed by a partner or ex-partner every week. But an even greater number of people experience abuse without reporting it – and many of them are migrant women. In my PhD research study on the experiences of migrant women who had experienced of domestic violence in the UK, all the participants had migrated, when they were over 18, to the UK in the past 20 years and were separated or divorced because of domestic violence. I also run workshops for Solace Women’s Aid, a charity that last year supported more than 10,000 women and children affected by domestic and sexual abuse. Domestic abuse is not limited by borders, culture, class, education or migration status. But there is now considerable evidence to show that migrant women, women of colour and women with low income are often at higher risk of domestic abuse. Of this group, migrant women, in particular, are far less likely to seek support. Most of the women I speak to blame themselves, feel ashamed and are reluctant to share what has happened (or is happening) to them. This is not unique to them, but several studies have shown that migration is a stressful and traumatic experience, and that factors such as not speaking the local language and a lack of family and social support puts these women at higher risk of domestic violence. When migration law gives a spouse control over the immigration status of family members, it forces many women to endure violence, as they are too afraid to seek help. The perpetrators reinforce their power by using women’s immigration status to threaten them. The six stages of domestic violence Sociologist Liz Kelly, professor of sexualised violence at London Metropolitan University, has identified six stages of domestic violence. At the beginning, women try to manage the situation and hide it. They hope their partner will change. By the second stage, when they realise he (and it is often men) will not change, they blame themselves and find excuses for him, saying he is stressed, or working hard, or they themselves need to be better. This distorts their reality – women do not perceive the behaviour as abuse, but believe they have marriage problems. Many women from developing countries see this as normal behaviour. At the third stage, women recognise the abuse and understand it is serious. In my research, I have found that migrant women arrive late to this stage, often when their children start school and they break their isolation by meeting other parents. By now, many women will start to make plans to find a way out. Again, at this stage, migrant women face challenges. Many don’t have anywhere to go. It’s not until women see a real threat to their lives or those of their children that they reach stage five and decide to end the relationship and flee. This stage is often complicated because it does not mean the end of abuse. Even when women find a way to escape, they still feel threatened by their abusers. Sometimes the perpetrators find them, even at refuges. Many perpetrators keep texting or use charm to convince their partners to return. Women often go through repeated relapses before abuse ends for good. The final stage is the end of the abuse. This can often feel like an illusion, particularly for women who need to keep in touch with the perpetrator for the sake of their children, and who must continue to manage an abusive relationship of the past. I have found that migrant women feel they get valuable support from the police and charities, but not enough from local authorities. More also needs to be done by community leaders to reach out to women who are more isolated. Many community leaders in this country are sceptical about the scale of the problem, even when statistics confirm how widespread this issue is. We all need to be more aware, more responsible and more receptive to the signs of domestic abuse. And we need to be ready to provide the help needed.

2017-08-25T04:00:02Z,EU states begin returning refugees to Greece as German reunions slow,"European countries are poised to begin the process of returning refugees to Greece, as migrants seeking reunification with their family members – mostly in Germany – step up protests in Athens. In a move decried by human rights groups, EU states will send back asylum seekers who first sought refuge in Greece, despite the nation being enmeshed in its worst economic crisis in modern times. Germany has made nearly 400 resettlement requests, according to officials in Berlin and sources in Athens’ leftist-led government. The UK, France, the Netherlands and Norway have also asked that asylum seekers be returned to Greece. Greece’s migration minister told the Guardian the first returns were expected imminently. “The paperwork has begun and we expect returns to begin over the next month,” said Yannis Mouzalas. “It will start with a symbolic number as an act of friendship [towards other EU nations]. Greece has already accepted so many [refugees], it has come under such pressure, that to accept more would be absurd, a joke if it weren’t such a tragedy.” Mouzalas said he had no idea where the returnees would be placed or whether they would ever leave Greece. “I don’t know where they will go. It could be Athens, it could be Thebes … they are accommodated in an apartment scheme,” he said. “Whatever [happens], conditions will be good, they have improved greatly and will meet EU criteria.” Officials say privately that acceptance of the transfers has been non-negotiable given Greece’s EU membership and receipt of funds from Brussels. Resettlement will not affect asylum seekers who arrived in the EU before March this year. Greece was at the centre of the 2015 migrant crisis, when close to a million men, women and children entered the country as part of onward journeys that often took them to Germany. Most were arriving from war-torn Syria. The number of people arriving dropped dramatically when the EU reached an accord with Turkey 17 months ago to help accommodate refugees from Syria. But hundreds are still arriving each week. Last week a reported 330 migrant arrivals were registered on Greece’s eastern Aegean isles, piling the pressure on overcrowded and vastly overstretched reception centres in Lesvos, Chios, Kos, Leros and Samos. An estimated 14,100 people are currently in limbo in accommodation centres on the Greek islands, according to figures released by the country’s interior ministry on Thursday. Conditions in the centres are described as deplorable, and protests and riots are commonplace. Human Rights Watch recently said self-harm and suicide attempts along with aggression, anxiety and depression were all on the rise. Local services complain about being unable to cope. Against such a backdrop, the spectre of more people being sent back to the debt-stricken country has been met with derision by organisations that have also denounced the EU-Turkey deal as deeply flawed. In 2011, returns of refugees to Greece were suspended after the European court of human rights intervened citing harsh conditions and poor treatment by Greek authorities. “It is incredible that a country like Germany, which now has so many camps standing empty because of the decreasing number of arrivals [since the Turkey-EU agreement], is demanding that people be sent back to Greece,” said Salinia Stroux, at the NGO Refugee Support Aegean. “It is not an argument to say they have too many or that they are not ready to accept any more when there are places that are there, ready and waiting, to host people whose rent has been already covered and paid for by the German state.” Angela Merkel’s administration has been criticised for putting the brakes on refugees being reunited with family members in Germany. Protests by Syrians demanding resettlement have mounted amid complaints that family reunions have been reduced to fewer than 100 per month, around a fifth of the number seen in the spring. The German government denies the existence of a formal cap on the number of reunifications from Greece. However, in a response to a parliamentary query submitted by the German Left party, the interior ministry admitted that “up to 4,339” mostly Syrian asylum seekers whose application for reunification had been approved were currently living in Greece. “What we have seen is a concerted effort to slow down the process of asylum seekers being reunited with their families in time for the German elections” next month, said Ulla Jelpke, a Die Linke MP. “The very same party which is running a family-friendly campaign is practising a policy which hurts families, only to gain a few votes from the rightwing spectrum.” Under EU asylum procedures popularly referred to as the Dublin regulations, refugees are required to lodge requests in the member state that is their point of entry to the bloc. “We don’t want to be here, we want to be in Berlin with our father,” said Nour Waez as she demonstrated in the sweltering summer heat outside the Asylum Service in Athens, 18 months after her family fled the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo. “We don’t want to wait any more. We want to continue our education, live normal lives. My father is a doctor. He joined my brother in Germany last year,” she explained. “Every day, me, my two sisters and my mother learn German from the books he has sent us. So much time has been lost. Why all this waiting when they have told us we can go?” Pushing his toddler son in a pram under the shade of a tree, 20-year-old Mohammed al-Mahamid, also from Syria, said: “We applied to go to Hamburg, where my brother lives, over a year ago. We are looking after his daughter here because she is ill and he could not take her. Every day we are told ‘wait until tomorrow’. Why? The conditions in Greece are very bad. We live in an old school building in Athens, there is no work, the food is not good and there is nothing to do.” Frustration has not only been limited to the slow pace of family reunions. In June 2015 the European council agreed to relocate more than 66,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to other EU member states. Mouzalas said a fraction had been resettled so far. “Around 17,000 have been relocated and around 7,000 reunited with their families. It is happening, but if I were them I would want the process to move faster,” he said. This month the minister told Germany’s state-run TV channel ARD that electoral calculations had probably played a role in the demand for refugee returns before federal polls in September. “There was pressure from several EU countries to resume returns,” he said. “I understand that governments want to show some results to their voters.” About 62,000 refugees are scattered across Greece. Outside of Athens where nearly 20,000 are now housed in rented apartments thanks to a scheme set up by municipal authorities and the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority are hosted in facilities established in former army barracks and factories. NGOs say they struggle to access basic supplies including healthcare. Greek port and police authorities have noted a surge in the numbers of men, women and children trying to flee over the summer. Ever more refugees travelling on fake passports have been stopped at island airports. Rising numbers of irregular migrants have been trying to slip into Italy by boat. “About 50% of those entering the country are economic migrants, they are not fleeing persecution or war,” added Mouzalas. Though the numbers of people heading to Greece are dwarfed by those in Italy, which has seen almost 100,000 arrivals so far this year, Mouzalas said the migration crisis in his country was far from over. “They continue to arrive, albeit in much smaller numbers, on the islands, across the Evros river, across our land border with Turkey, wherever they can,” he said. “To say the crisis is over depends on the war [in Syria], on Turkey, on Europe. In Greece, we remain very concerned.”"
2017-06-15T11:54:54Z,Brazil's refugee policy needs a radical overhaul in response to Venezuela's crisis,"Brazil is failing to respond to one of the most serious forced migration crises in decades. The economic and political maelstrom in neighboring Venezuela has forced thousands of people to flee into Brazil in search of food, medicine and basic survival. According to Brazil’s border police, more than 77,000 Venezuelans poured into Brazil between 2015 and 2016. While most are eager to return to Venezuela, many are seeking asylum. There are already 8,231 Venezuelans who have officially claimed asylum in 2017 and another 5,000 others waiting for an appointment. Roughly 150 new claims are being received every single day. The situation for the new arrivals is dire. They are living on the streets and in improvised shelters. Many people have contracted diseases associated with poor living conditions and rely on overstretched and understaffed hospitals. Human Rights Watch reports that almost 2,000 migrants were diagnosed with malaria in 2016. The number of Venezuelan women seeking maternity care has also sky-rocketed, as have reports of kidnapping, rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation. The emergency response has been meagre. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has increased its presence at the border and is working with the Brazilian federal government to craft an emergency plan. But in the face of rapidly deteriorating conditions in Venezuela, the contingency plan is dangerously far from being effective. For their part, state and municipal authorities are reticent about getting fully involved. Many officials fear that assistance to migrants is an electoral liability. One mayor went so far as to suggest that Brazil should close its border with Venezuela to avoid new arrivals. Making matters worse, there appears to be no long-term strategy to anticipate mass migration situations in the future. Instead, refugees are left to fend for themselves with a small clutch of charities and non-governmental organisations providing support where they can. Unless Brazil significantly rethinks and retools its migration and asylum systems to the new reality of increasing human mobility, the country will be in permanent response mode. This is not just a question of morality, ethics and “doing the right thing”. There are stark legal and operational implications of Brazil’s non-action. While having a long-standing reputation as a “welcoming” country, Brazil has never had a federal institution devoted exclusively to migration. As a result, skills and resources are scattered across different ministries. Astonishingly, the national asylum system has had no structural changes since 1997, a period when Brazil received no more than 500 asylum claims a year. At the moment, there are six case workers assisting a National Committee that gathers only once a month to process more than 15,000 new claims each year. Not surprisingly, there’s a backlog of at least 25,000 asylum cases. Particularly concerning is the fact that Brazil has no digital system in place to track its migrant and refugee population. No one actually knows how many asylum-seekers and refugees there are in Brazil. There is no centralised information on their nationalities, age or gender, much less their basic needs for protection and support. If Brazil wishes to upgrade its system into the 21st century it needs at the very least a unified data management system. Information should be gathered at entry and exit points, processed at the federal level and then used to drive informed public policies. Brazil’s restrictive migration law was updated this past month. In spite of a searing political and economic crisis, a handful of enlightened Brazilian policy makers proposed new legislation focused on protecting and preserving migrants’ rights. Sadly, not all is good news. 20 presidential vetoes introduced in the last few weeks have vastly diminished the power of the new law. The much-awaited amnesty for migrants in an irregular situation, a practice adopted by Brazilian administrations since the 1980s, was one of the major drawbacks to the bill. What’s more, it’s become patently clear that the government is not even remotely prepared to implement the new law in terms of procedure and policy. Brazil must create a new institution to manage migration. This is essential to coordinating the government’s response to refugees. Equally important is the deployment of a semi-permanent presence in key border areas and major urban centres to provide assistance to those who need it most. In a continent-sized country such as Brazil, asylum processing and refugee assistance cannot be restricted to just two or three major cities as is currently the case. States and municipalities must be incentivised to step-up and work in a coordinated manner. The country also needs to deliver on its commitment to develop a new resettlement programme. Previous initiatives were fully funded by UNHCR and offered comparatively few places when compared to Brazil’s sheer size and potential. In almost 15 years, no more than 800 refugees were resettled in the country. With international funding waning, Brazil has not resettled a single claimant in 10 months. An enlarged programme, targeting particularly vulnerable groups and involving all levels of government, private firms, civil society and international organizations is critical and could serve as a model for Latin America. At a time of increasing reactionary nationalism, in which border walls and security fences continue to be built to control migration, it is imperative that Brazil updates its approach to forced migration. It needs to match the rhetoric of an open-door policy with real improvements in the institutionalisation, coordination and management of refugee protection and resettlement. The crisis affecting its Venezuelan neighbours provides an opportunity to make the necessary changes and honour its tradition as a defender of the poor and vulnerable.

2017-12-15T04:00:10Z,Second cohort of Nauru and Manus refugees to be resettled in US,"Nearly 200 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention islands of Nauru and Manus will be resettled in the United States in the new year. But the newly-reinstated travel ban imposed by US president Donald Trump is excluding certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranian refugees have been told the president’s executive order has meant “the United States government is currently undertaking an additional review of refugees resettlement from selected countries worldwide and will temporarily prioritise refugee applications from other countries”. “This means that refugees processing from selected countries, including in your resettlement case, will occur at a slower pace.” The Trump travel ban, reinstated by the US supreme court earlier this month, suspends the entry into the US of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela. Iranians make up the largest cohort of refugees on both of Australia’s offshore processing centres. The Guardian understands about 130 people from Nauru have been accepted to move to the US, and close to 60 from PNG. The group will be the second cohort resettled under the US deal brokered in 2016, after 54 refugees went to the US in September. The majority of refugees accepted for resettlement in the current group are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and stateless Rohingyans from Myanmar and Bangladesh. On Nauru, young men from Afghanistan and Pakistan, who arrived on the island as unaccompanied children but have since reached adulthood, have been accepted for resettlement. Some Iranian refugees have been rejected. Several families, from Iran and Sri Lanka, have also been rejected. On Manus, Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat said those accepted for resettlement had been told they will leave for the United States on 12 January. “Those who received their results today were so excited that they will fly to the US … and the others in the camps are so sad because their names are not on the list. I hope everyone will get his freedom to a safe country soon. “The US deal will take many months or years and will not provide places for everyone. We will continue our protests on Manus until there is a safe country for everyone.” Ezatullah Kakar, a Pakistani refugee, told the Guardian he was still waiting for an interview for his resettlement. His roommate has left Manus for Port Moresby, ahead of flying to the United States next month. “We are still waiting. Of course it’s hard. And it’s the same game, like other people on our boats, we were all in Christmas Island and they went to Australia and we were sent to Manus.” Kakar said the US resettlement process would likely take months for those still waiting for initial interviews. “It’s very hard; I can’t believe they are wasting all this time.” Last week, Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton said the resettlement process was the bailiwick of US authorities, but that the process was progressing. “I am hoping there can be an uplift as soon as possible but that is an issue for the United States ... and interviews continue, the background checks, and all of that process that the United States is involved in continues.” Department sources say there is increasing confidence the US will accept close to the 1,250 refugees it has previously publicly suggested could be settled, and that that figure could be reached by the end of its current annual intake, which resets in October. The 1,250 would not be enough to clear Australia’s offshore islands of refugees. There are about 1,600 refugees currently held in both Nauru and PNG. Asylum seekers found not to meet the criteria for protection under the refugees’ convention are not being considered for US resettlement. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said the latest cohort to be accepted for resettlement was “great news” for those selected. “But it also exposes all the problems that exist with the US deal: the selective nature of the agreement; the travel ban having an impact. People have been waiting over four years, but so many still don’t know what is going to happen to them. “The US deal is not going to provide enough places for all the people found to be owed protection. That has created enormous anxiety and distress.”"
2017-12-22T16:07:09Z,Graffiti about sex with refugees stunned me – but I wasn’t surprised | Jade Jackman,"As our cities’ skylines spiral upwards, we have grown accustomed to increasingly bad street art. For self-preservation, we train our eyes to dull the slogans that cover the buildings that gentrification means many can no longer afford to enter, but the white words painted on a wall in Shoreditch, east London, will stay with me: “Sex with refugees is jasmine-scented and beautiful”. The words, which have now been painted over, stunned me. Artist Robert Montgomery says that the words were ripped from another piece of his. This reads: “The refugees are beautiful, they bring ancient music and desert sweets and jasmine-filled sex”, which he happily posted for us all to see. On Facebook he denied creating the Shoreditch graffiti. But either version of the sentiment shows ignorance over the words and social misconceptions about the current refugee crisis. It is with a deep bitterness that it has to be spelled out that neither love nor sex is the solution. My mother was born in Malaysia, and this language echoes the colonial narrative that makes me feel sick. Throughout history, women of colour have been presented as alluring and tantalisingly exotic. The repercussions of this are felt through porn, advertising and experiences that women of colour have while dating. This piece of art mirrors that. The choice of language presents sex with another human as essentially different, foreign or fetish. This is not a great basis for relationships nor a way to bring about racial equality. As Jinan Petra, a campaigner against immigration detention, tells me: “To write such racist, orientalist, harmful bullshit about people who have been through so much – including sexual violence – in migration ... there are very few words. I’m a Syrian woman and in my professional and personal life I know that these views exist; the sentiment and the entitlement don’t surprise me.” From my own work with female refugees, I am painfully aware of the sexual violence that vulnerable people face. While preparing to teach film-making to young asylum seekers and undocumented youth, we were faced with the grim reality that assault and rape were common. Not only is the journey notoriously perilous, the dangers don’t stop when you arrive in Britain. Without secure status, you are at the whim of those around you. For some, this has meant staying in abusive “romantic” relationships, while others have faced sexual violence from guards inside detention facilities. Even if you do happen to be in a loving relationship, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” can make it difficult. One evening, as the sun set, I awkwardly looked away as a man told his wife he loved her inside Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre. “Don’t touch her,” a guard barked. They dropped their hands, wondering if this is what intimacy meant now. All the love in the world means nothing without money for a visa. While the Shoreditch “artwork” is disappointing, its obliviousness comes as no surprise. In British schools, we are not taught the true legacies of colonialism nor how people’s livelihoods have been damaged by our warfare. This accounts for people’s shock over the treatment of migrants in Libya. Often, the charity campaigns surrounding the refugee crisis are no better. Take the Save the Children advert that attempted to garner sympathy through the narrative of a white young girl, asking what if this happened in Europe. It ignored and erased the historical reasons as to why this is not happening here. Similarly, statements such as “refugees are welcome” is a powerful rallying cry but ignores that the UK has one of the biggest and most cruel detention facilities in Europe. Refugees can be held indefinitely. This is how our government “secures” our borders; it isn’t something we can shag away. From the perspective of Aleksandra Bilic, a film-maker who came to this country as a child refugee herself: “It is hard to realise that problems cannot be solved without confronting the greater factors at play and that these issues are beyond ourselves. But this is not a topic for artists to literally fuck with, as these are real issues. If you are going to speak on them, you should try and understand them.” This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t tackle political causes in their work. We need political art with teeth. But our talk of politics comes at a high cost. We have a responsibility to do our research, know the context that our work operates in and be genuinely informed about the cause we seek to amplify. If you do, it’ll prevent wasting time painting over shallow and harmful statements that nobody asked to see. • Jade Jackman is a documentary film-maker and writer based in London"
2017-10-01T07:00:11Z,The Road to Mandalay review – potent migrant drama,"This potent drama about two migrants who meet as they flee the civil war in Burma for a new life in Thailand hits many of the expected beats of stories about the stateless displaced. Even so, the stylistically bold approach that director Midi Z brings to the struggle of Lianqing and Guo, the boy who loves her, sets this apart. A combination of tender details – the way Guo carefully picks the fibres from his girlfriend’s skin after a gruelling shift at the factory – and a strikingly surreal approach to a scene in which Lianqing prostitutes herself for the first time makes this unflinching picture a notable addition to the ever-swelling list of films that deal with migration."
2017-08-10T18:38:10Z,"Teargas, cold, no toilets: plight of refugees in Calais revealed","The woods around Calais and Dunkirk have once again become home to more than 1,000 refugees and migrants living in dire conditions without access to toilets, running water, showers or shelter. Police regularly confiscate sleeping bags, bedding and possessions, and refugees complain that CS spray is often used during early morning raids on people sleeping. Reports of police harassment of refugees have risen as officials from both towns attempt, without success, to stop refugees from settling in the area. But some kind of new camp now looks inevitable in Calais after a court ruled that the city government must provide showers and water supplies for the rapidly rising population of asylum seekers, who are mostly teenagers from Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of them are travelling alone, some as young as 12. The water supplies were due to be installed by Friday, although the local administration would provide no details of how many were to be installed or where. Because Calais police remove tents immediately, hundreds of refugees are sleeping in the open on wasteland behind an industrial zone near the port. Some camp on a heap of asphalt, others in the woods, where the area is littered with abandoned clothes and large quantities of human excrement. Even in August, the weather in northern France is stormy and cold. Someone has written “Refugees Welcome” on a nearby wall, but it does not feel a welcoming place. Ismail Roble, a biology teacher from Ethiopia, from the Oromo minority group, has been in Calais for eight months and is hoping to join family in the UK. He said police had taken his bedding again early that morning. “I can’t count how many times it has happened. They spray your eyes when you are asleep,” he said as he queued for food. “It’s very stressful living in these forests. We have no shelter, no hygiene, no sanitation, no water. It’s very cold at night. The French have given us nothing.” In Dunkirk, refugees complain of a much more aggressive approach by local police, who arrive most weeks urging people sleeping in the woods to move on and destroying tents. Amal Muhammed, an Iraqi woman, is travelling with her Iranian husband, Sahid Rebaz, their two children, Deia, 10, and Yousuf, three, and her severely disabled younger brother, Sardam Muhammed, 22, who is unable walk or speak. She said police had slashed their tent while they were sheltering in a clearing in the woods on Monday. She showed cuts in the fabric of the tent, which they have now abandoned. “They came when we were asleep and shouted ‘Get up, get up!’ The children were frightened. I was frightened,” she said. The family hope to make it somehow to the UK, where they believe they will have better job opportunities, but they appeared to have no understanding of border policy. “If they don’t let us cross, will they just let my brother and the children in?” Muhammed asked. “My brother needs to cross to the UK. He needs medicine,” she said, asking another Iraqi refugee to translate for her. “We really need someone to help us. There is no water here, no toilets. It’s not a suitable place for children to live.” Sarbast Amin, from Iraq, spent more than 10 years living in St Ives, working for a picture framing company. But this year his wife, Viyan Sadeeq Abdullah, was sent to Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre and then deported to Italy after her asylum claim was rejected. He is also staying in the woods, hoping to find a way to return with his wife to the country they consider home. He described conditions as “very hard”. Charlie Whitbread, a volunteer with Mobile Refugee Support, which helps distribute tents and phone-charging facilities for refugees, said the attitude of police officers varied from week to week. “Some weeks they are quite aggressive and confiscate everything, including baby food and milk. This week it wasn’t quite so bad,” he said. A Human Rights Watch report published late last month, titled Like Living in Hell, documented frequent use of CS spray, routine abuse of asylum seekers and migrants and regular disruption of food distribution sessions, concluding that the behaviour appeared to be driven “by a desire to keep down migrant numbers”. But because Calais is known to be the closest crossing point to the UK, these official attempts to make it an unattractive destination for refugees have not worked and people continue to arrive. The charity Help Refugees, which has worked in the area for two years, conducts monthly headcounts and estimates that there are at least 600 migrants in Calais, around 300 in Dunkirk and another 200 in small camps along the coast. The Refugee Community Kitchen, which cooks food for people living in small groups in wasteland around Calais and Dunkirk, says it is distributing 2,500 meals a day (feeding people twice a day). The Calais prefecture said in an emailed response to questions that it believed there were 450 migrants in the Calais area. The local authorities’ reluctance to install basic facilities for refugees reflects a familiar tension for officials, who are at pains to discourage any return of a large-scale or permanent camp by the port with the provision of any services that they believe might attract migrants to this area of northern France. The French interior minister, Gérard Collomb, said this week that 17,867 attempts to breach port and tunnel security had been detected so far this year, along with 12,349 attempts to stow away in trucks. He promised that mobile toilets would be provided in Calais but said it was important to “avoid doing anything that resembles fixed infrastructure”. When the Calais camp was demolished last October, thousands of refugees were driven in buses to hostels around France. They were encouraged to seek permanent residency in France, or to return home. In March local authorities attempted to ban charities from distributing food to people sleeping in the woodlands around the city, but the ban was overruled by the local courts. Aid workers say the ongoing attempts to disperse migrants have made their work much more challenging. In Dunkirk, families are forced to hide in more remote woodland spots, further from food distribution points, making it harder for charities to make sure they have the food and provisions they need. All volunteers say conditions have deteriorated significantly. Maddie Skipsey, an English teacher from London who has helped distribute food and clothing during the school holidays over the past 18 months, said: “The camp was absolutely disgusting – the facilities, the way people were treated – but at least people had some kind of home and shelter. Now they have nothing.” Since the migration crisis has slipped off the political agenda, donations of clothes and bedding have dropped and the warehouse is low on sleeping bags and men’s clothes, particularly underwear. Last month volunteers sewed socks out of old clothes because refugees urgently needed socks and supplies had run out. On Monday, France’s migration service sent buses to take refugees from Calais and Dunkirk to two new reception centres in towns further inland, to allow them to take stock of their options and consider applying for asylum in France. Around 45 went from Calais and 30 from Dunkirk, but volunteers said there were no translators available and there was confusion about the purpose of the bus trip. At least some returned to the port towns later the same day. For a few months after the demolition of the camp, migrants disappeared from the streets of Calais. Now groups of young men can be seen waiting at roundabouts near lorry parking spots or walking along the edge of the motorway that leads to the ferry port. The roads around the city are becoming dangerous again both for migrants and truck drivers. Last week a 22-year-old man from Eritrea was killed after falling from a lorry on the motorway near the port. After a short period without deaths of migrants on the roads near Calais, two more plots have been added this year to the migrants’ area in the cemetery, where basic wooden pauper’s graves are allocated to dead refugees. In June, a Polish truck driver was killed after refugees blockaded a motorway with three trunks, causing a crash in which his vehicle caught fire. In a field behind the chemical factories near the port, refugees were washing their clothes with a canister of water and washing-up liquid, pummelling T-shirts on a black plastic binbag ripped open to make a clean surface, and hanging the clothes to dry on the bushes. Some said they could not remember the last time they had been able to wash properly. “I think it was a month and a half ago,” said West Justnui, 25, an Ethiopian who would like to study political science in the UK. Others said they washed in the sea by the port, but found the salt water left them feeling dirty. A long-term Calais resident, Sylvie, who asked for her full not not to be printed, has been offering showers in her home to teenage refugees ever since the camp closed last year. “I feel beyond ashamed at the mayor’s approach. Now the camp has gone, people have no shelter, no way of washing themselves. I couldn’t bear to see the conditions they were living in, so now I let people come three times a week to shower in my home.” She said most people in Calais were unmoved by the refugees’ situation. “People here have become very hard.”"
2017-11-30T13:05:40Z,Voluntary evacuation planned for migrants as Libya battles slavery claims,"A plan for a voluntary evacuation of migrants in Libya government-controlled detention camps has been put at the heart of an emergency migration plan for Africa. Leaders from the European Union and the African Union arrived for a summit in Ivory Coast on Wednesday vowing to take action following CNN’s shocking video footage of slave auction houses in Libya. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, described the abuse of migrants as “a crime against humanity” and said that the EU and AU would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks”. In an interview with France 24, Macron said he was not advocating sending foreign troops to Libya, adding: “It’s not about declaring war, Libya is a state in political transition ... but there’s reinforced police action that needs to be done to dismantle those networks. We’ll do it.” He also called for “individual, financial and physical sanctions” against human-trafficking networks, which he said were closely linked to terror groups in the region. The plan, which could see up to 15,000 people flown out of Libya, requires the government to allow the UN’s evacuation planes to land, as well as for source countries to come to a holding centre in Tripoli and take back their citizens. Migrants without documentation would be held until their case is resolved. The EU is likely to provide the funding, which in effect dramatically speeds up a voluntary repatriation scheme already being run by the International Organization for Migration. Opening the summit, the Ivorian president, Alassane Ouattara, said: “Given this wretched drama which recalls the worst hours of human history, I would like to appeal to our sense of responsibility to take all urgent measures to put an end to this practice, which belongs to another age.” Some African leaders also expressed anger at the Libyan government, with the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, claiming it was appalling that his compatriots were being sold “like goats”. In a rare press conference on Thursday, the Libyan embassy in London said every effort was being made to investigate claims of slavery auction markets, adding anyone found guilty would be charged under a 1953 law banning slavery. Mohamed Alkoni, the Libyan charge d’affaires, insisted throughout his life he had “never seen or heard any signs of racism in Libya”, and added any proven allegations of slavery “is an act of an individual, and not a systematic practice”. The practices, if proven, “contravene all the values, traditions and customs of the Libyan people”, he said. No cases had been put before the Libyan courts prior to the CNN allegations, he said, suggesting that the news of the slave auctions had come as a surprise to ministers. He also said the Libyan state lacked the resources to oversee the detention centres fully. “You are talking about a large number of detention centres and it is not easy to control them”. Migration was already at the top of the agenda for the first AU-EU summit since 2014, but the footage of markets in Libya injected immediacy into the issue, spurring French government calls at the UN on Tuesday for sanctions against identified traffickers, the closure of migrant detention camps and renewed calls for Europe to accept more African migrants on a managed basis. More than 3,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Italy this year, it was confirmed this week. AU states are eager to ensure that the Libyan crisis does not detract from an agenda to address the long-term causes of migration, including poor governance, climate change and absence of private sector investment. They also want EU commitments on the number of migrants it is willing to take. France has promised to accept at least 3,000 from Niger and Chad over two years. Both Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have promised to make Africa a priority, but details of EU funds for Africa are often opaque. Macron is on a three-day tour of Africa and, in his first major address on the continent before a crowd of university students in Burkina Faso on Tuesday, said he wanted Africa and Europe to “help populations trapped in Libya by providing massive support to the evacuation of endangered people”. Conscious that France, by backing the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, is seen as having a large share of responsibility for Libya’s current political disarray, Macron reiterated his criticisms of French intervention in Libya under Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011. “I would not have supported the intervention in Libya,” he said, “because there was not a diplomatic vision or diplomatic solution.” Taking questions from the students in Burkina Faso, Macron downplayed the idea of European countries opening their doors to more direct migration from Africa. “If you say, ‘I’ve got a right to total access without conditions’ ... I can’t explain that to my [lower middle class], who have worked, who pay their taxes,” he said. “What do I tell them?”"
2017-12-08T13:00:03Z,Who are the charities we're supporting with our 2017 charity appeal?,"The Guardian and Observer 2017 charity appeal is supporting three charities working with young homeless people and asylum seekers, refugees and migrants facing destitution. Here’s a brief guide to what they do. Depaul UK Depaul UK is a national charity that works to end homelessness and change the lives of those affected by it. Its services include supported housing for homeless young people, family mediation, and leading the Nightstop emergency accommodation network across the UK. Nightstop operates in 34 towns and cities, giving young people a safe place to stay for the night in the spare room of volunteer hosts. Last year the Nightstop network gave 1,390 young people in desperate need a safe place to stay for the night. For many Nightstop guests, their first night in a volunteer’s home is the beginning of their journey out of homelessness as staff work to find safe and sustainable long-term accommodation following their stay. Depaul UK provides support with getting into education, training and employment for all the young people who live in its supported accommodation to help them rebuild their lives. Depaul UK helped 3,107 young people last year but the demand for new services is great. The No Accommodation Network (Naccom) Naccom’s mission is to end destitution among asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds living in the UK. It helps member organisations to develop their services and advocate for changes in the system. The network includes more than 40 full-member charities and projects that provide accommodation (including housing, night shelters and hosting schemes) to people who cannot access mainstream support and accommodation. In the last year it accommodated 1,907 people. Naccom will use its share of the Guardian and Observer appeal donations to capacity-build the network and support frontline projects via a selective grants process that will be open to its full members. Members are supported to gather and share data and stories that illustrate the extent and impact of destitution and the positive outcomes that can be achieved. Naccom works with others to ensure collaborative working where appropriate and shared learning across the wider homelessness and refugee and migrant sectors. Centrepoint Centrepoint is the UK’s leading charity for homeless young people. It supports more than 9,200 16- to 25-year-olds each year. It works directly in London, Yorkshire, Manchester and the north-east of England, and partners with other organisations across the UK. It provides a range of accommodation services for young people depending on their needs, including specialist services for single parents, young people leaving care and those escaping violence and abuse. Centrepoint aims to give young people the skills and resilience they need to live independently. The charity employs a team of counsellors and therapists to support young people with mental health and wellbeing issues. It runs healthy living and nutrition workshops and a sports programme to inspire confidence and positive change in young people. Young people are helped to enter or continue with education, training and employment, with support tailored to their needs. It works with young people to influence government policy with the overall aim of ending youth homelessness. Support our three chosen charities by donating here"
2017-11-27T03:37:04Z,China: 'ruthless' campaign to evict Beijing's migrant workers condemned,"More than a hundred Chinese intellectuals and scholars have decried a “ruthless” campaign to evict thousands of migrant workers from Beijing. The latest round of evictions began in the wake of a fire on 18 November that killed 19 people in an industrial neighbourhood in south Beijing, and 17 of the victims were migrants. City officials have declared a 40-day campaign against “illegal structures”, which for years have housed the millions of migrant workers who run Beijing’s restaurants, delivery companies, construction sites, retail shops and a host of small factories. The open letter, which was addressed to the country’s leadership and circulated on Chinese social media, called the evictions “a serious trampling of human rights”. Signatories included professors, researchers, poets and artists and more names continued to be added. It criticised the lack of due process and rapid speed at which the campaign was being implemented. Videos and photos posted on social media showed streets clogged with clothes and other belongings after migrants were given just minutes to pack up. Many who had lived in the Chinese capital for years were only allowed to take what they could carry before police sealed entire buildings. Authorities reportedly cut water and electrical service in some cases. “Any civilised and law abiding society cannot tolerate this, we must clearly condemn and oppose these actions,” the letter said. The haphazard nature of the mass evictions make it difficult to determine exactly how many people have been displaced. Migrants are being forced from their homes at the start of Beijing’s winter and temperature have hovered around freezing for the past week. China operated a national “household registration” system designed to control internal movement, meaning migrant workers lack many of the rights compared to native Beijingers. The system has been widely criticised for years and officials have pledged reform but have made little progress. Beijing officials have targeted a 15% cut in population of the downtown districts from 2014 levels within the next two years. That amounts to a reduction of about two million people, and authorities have also plan to demolish 40m square metres of illegal housing. International rights groups also condemned the campaign. “It’s somewhat astounding that the large numbers of migrant workers could be evicted so quickly, but this is in part because the Chinese authorities have systematically eroded all the ways people can protect their rights,” said William Nee, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “And, of course, China maintains the world’s largest censorship apparatus, so that it’s hard to meaningfully debate issues of injustice.” But Beijing officials denied they were targeting migrant workers at all, and said it was focused on safety. “It is irresponsible and groundless to say the campaign is to evict the ‘low-end population’,” an official from the Beijing Administration of Work Safety told local media."
2017-12-22T05:00:44Z,'Welcome to prison': winter hits in one of Greece's worst refugee camps,"High in the hills of the Greek island of Lesbos, in a former military camp now filled with containers and tents, the onset of winter has elicited particular dread. In the countdown to its official arrival, protests have become louder both inside and outside the facility, whose wall is graffitied with the menacing message: welcome to Moria prison. For the men, women and children forced to call Moria their home, the refugee camp is a daily battle for survival in conditions so desperate that even the Greek migration minister has warned they could be life-threatening. For human rights groups, who have long sounded the alarm, the vastly overcrowded camp is a tragedy waiting to happen and an embarrassment for Europe. Now, as the rains begin to fall and riots erupt, authorities in Athens are taking action, pledging to transfer 5,000 asylum seekers to the mainland. For the first time in more than a year, Moria’s population has dipped beneath 6,000, it was announced this week. The camp, originally built as a temporary measure at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, was designed to accommodate 2,000. Most of its occupants live in flimsy tents whose only preparation for winter has involved using wooden pallets to elevate tarpaulins above the mud. At all hours the air is pungent with thick, acrid smoke – the result of plastic bottles being burned by detainees to keep warm in the absence of readily available wood. Mounds of litter lie along pathways of slush and excrement, the latter spillover from lavatories unable to cope with a population that for the last 18 months has been three times over camp’s capacity. “Moria [is] very bad,” says Saleh Alhussein, a Syrian refugee, explaining that it took days before a doctor could properly attend to a wound on the head of his baby son, Mohammed. “There are holes in our tent. This isn’t Europe.” After last year’s accord between the EU and Turkey – a landmark agreement intended to curb the number of people attempting to make the perilous journey to Europe – an estimated 15,000 migrants and refugees have amassed on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands, the vast majority marooned by the complexities of an overwhelmed asylum service that condemns them to remain there until requests are processed. Lesbos is not alone. Similar settlements exist on Chios, Leros, Samos and Kos, all within sight of smuggler networks on Turkey’s Asia minor coast. But none is worse than Moria. Lesbos’s mayor, Spyros Galinos, has for months been issuing increasingly panic-stricken appeals for the camp to be decongested. Officially inmates are free to come and go. Unofficially, says Galinos, it is a “national disgrace”, a giant detention centre where drug dealing, alcohol abuse and prostitution are rampant and clashes between rival ethnic groups rife. “I’ve run out of ways of describing conditions that are beyond deplorable,” he says. “I recently compared what they are doing here to Guantánamo but of course I’ve never been to Guantánamo. Perhaps concentration camp would be better.” Those considered “vulnerable” including pregnant women and unaccompanied minors are currently among the hundreds being moved to the mainland as the operation to relieve pressure on islands steps up. Greece’s leftist-led government had previously resisted such transfers, fearing they could encourage traffickers. Galinos exudes calm despite facing mounting criticism from both the left and right in a country still reeling from economic crisis. The mechanics of frustration are in overdrive. Refugee anger is spiralling, but so too is exasperation among locals who at the height of the refugee drama saw more than 800,000 people traverse the island. Foreigners, he claims, now constitute a third of the population of Mytilene, Lesbos’s main town, and he knows many who are afraid to venture out at night. “This is an emergency situation that requires emergency solutions,” Galinos says. “Since the summer we have been saying: ‘Do something in Moria.’ People are going to die if something isn’t done, if the infrastructure isn’t improved.” Last week, the government rushed in emergency aid in the form of containers – enough to house between two and three hundred refugees. With EU member states still wrangling over their duty to accept mandatory refugee quotas, Greece and Italy remain on the frontline of migration routes to Europe. Though the numbers are far lower than they were at the height of the crisis in 2015, boatloads of people continue to land on Lesbos’s shores. Most are fleeing areas that were Isis-controlled strongholds in Syria and Iraq. For Moria, their arrival means further pressure – on space, resources and goodwill. The camp’s workers and volunteers say it is now more packed than Manila, the mostly densely populated city in the world. There have been outbreaks of scabies but nowhere to isolate people. With space at a premium and clashes frequently erupting at night, women have taken to wearing adult nappies because they are too fearful to venture from their tents. Standing beside the camp’s razor wire–topped inner courtyard, where asylum requests are processed, Said Asidi attributed the explosive mood to the frustration of waiting for a notoriously slow-moving system. The 45-year-old Afghan acts as the interface between his community and authorities and has spent almost two years waiting for an answer to his asylum request. “I have no idea why,” he says. “I’ve had three interviews, my last six months ago, but still no decision.” For many Moria has come to embody policy-making at its worse – almost three years into a migration crisis that has prompted the most expensive humanitarian response in history. Volunteers such as Jeremy Holloman say the conditions on the Greek islands are comparable with emergencies in Haiti and Honduras. Surrounded by mounds of rubbish, the American describes how the drain behind him erupted when a pipe in the camp’s overloaded sewage system burst last week. “If this is the best Europe has to offer, I am shocked,” he says. “In 2015 it was an onslaught [in terms of arrivals] and very difficult to respond to, but two years later in 2017, we should know better.” As well as transfers to the mainland, the Greek government is now pinning its hopes on Turkey accepting more deportees following a historic visit by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to Athens earlier this month. But the intricacies of diplomacy mean little to those holed up in Moria. Andrew Foley, an Irish volunteer, is far from optimistic. “It will [still] be a case of damage limitation, with NGOs struggling to meet needs that far exceed their capacity,” he says. “Moria undermines everything Europe stands for. If you keep people in conditions like this, if you rob them of hope and condemn them to suffer, nothing good will come of it.”"
2017-12-30T08:00:07Z,Abigail Housing rescues refugees condemned to destitution by UK law,"For the 20 or so refugees gathered in the warmth of Abigail Housing’s base, up some back steps on an industrial estate just outside Bradford city centre, this is their last hope. It is a source of profound anger among the volunteers who provide a room, food parcel and £15 a week to save these people from homelessness and poverty that British law condemns them to destitution. There is little obviously distinctive in so multicultural a city about the men and women chatting, sipping tea and munching biscuits here, but all have fled horrors at home, endured dreadful journeys and then suffered hardship in the UK. Destitution comes as a result of the Home Office refusing their asylum claims – mostly, according to Amanda Church-Michael, Abigail Housing’s destitution project coordinator, because their stories are not believed. Refused asylum seekers have a legal right to appeal, but the government sheds any responsibility for their safety or even survival. They are prohibited from working – itself a torment, according to Nene, 42, from Congo – and are also ineligible for benefits or social housing. All they have are the very basics, pulled together by Abigail Housing, a full member of the No Accommodation Network (Naccom), one of the Guardian and Observer’s three 2017 appeal charities providing help for homeless and destitute people. Naccom will use its share of the Guardian and Observer appeal donations to build the capacity of its network and support frontline projects via a selective grants process that will be open to its full members. “Our motivation is to welcome strangers in our country,” says Maggie Peel, the chair of Abigail Housing’s destitution project. “Many people working to help refugees are Christian, but it makes me sick and I am ashamed that the government presides over a system so mean-spirited and uncaring.” The refugees are calm, polite, grateful for Abigail Housing’s mercies, but their personal stories are a world of woe. Most, Church-Michael says, are from Eritrea, fleeing religious persecution like Abraham, 27, and Helen, 23, who says she was left alone at 16 when her mother died. Nene says she worked as a fashion designer in Congo and had two children but was imprisoned after protesting against the government. Rape and other atrocities were just part of prison routine, she says. After she was released she fled to Angola, then took a flight to London where she claimed asylum. She was moved to accommodation in Wakefield, but the Home Office refused her claim. She appealed, which took her back into the system, enabling her to be housed as an asylum seeker and receive the statutory £36.95 weekly allowance, but was refused again. She has moved accommodation 13 times since arriving in the UK and, although she is appealing again, she dreads another move from her the Abigail Housing room she shares with Helen and two other women. “It is so hard,” she says, closing her eyes. She is bewildered by the UK system, which she feels is a trap, weighted against accepting asylum claims. Those who claim here are barred from making another claim in a more welcoming country if they are refused. “I am so tired. They are treating me as if I am an enemy. Why?” she asks. “If I do not stay strong, I could think: ‘I will sell my body to get some money’.” Abigail Housing was started in 2007 by a Bradford couple, John and Anne Hebden, who were shocked at the system’s cruelties. It now has five donated or leased houses for 19 people. In Leeds it has a further 60 rooms in 15 houses for vulnerable refugees. The destitution project, funded entirely from donations and charitable grants, provides a room in one of the shared houses, food that can be collected on a Monday and £15 per week. “I really appreciate Abigail Housing, it is very helpful,” says Baba, 34, who fled his home in Guinea, leaving his wife and daughter, following a military coup in 2012, when soldiers attacked and burned his shop. “There is no security in my country. I can’t go back,” he says. He was put in detention when he arrived in Manchester, and has since suffered racism, homelessness and relentless poverty. He has also been beaten up. His head feels like it is boiling, he says, taking off his cap to show that his hair is falling out as a result of the stress. It is agony for him that the Home Office did not believed his story, telling him he had come here on holiday. “My heart is broken from that word, the pain will never go away,” he says. “I had a business, family. I had no plans even to travel. Until today I am asking myself: ‘Is this real?’” There are Christmas parcels on the table. Everybody is getting a box of donated Thorntons chocolates, but the presents also include underpants, shower gel and cheap gloves. Abigail Housing’s share of readers’ donations, as one of the 40 organisations in Naccom, will just help with core costs: maintaining the houses, buying food and paying the bills. “It is basic,” says Peel. “And we try to help people move on. We have a waiting list.” Support our three chosen charities by donating here."
2017-10-31T07:00:59Z,The refugees are in a state of terror on Manus | Behrouz Boochani,"Behrouz Boochani is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island since August 2014. The Guardian invited Boochani to keep a diary of the countdown to the closure of the Australian-run detention camp that is closing on Tuesday. Tuesday 31 October Last night the refugees were up until the early hours of the morning. You see, the department of immigration posted a document on the fences in the prison warning us that we only have until 5pm to exit the camp. If we remain we will be confronted with soldiers from the navy. This is a serious warning. It is a warning of impeding danger that has sent the refugees spiralling into terror. This is what has impelled the refugees to stay up until the morning. At 5am all the local and Australian guards have abandoned the camp. For the whole day there has not been a single person inside or around the parameters of the camp to protect the refugees. The situation has descended into an even worse crisis. At the same time we are receiving news from outside that the soldiers and police have armed themselves. The whole precarious situation has been militarised in a terribly perverse manner. However, no one knows for sure if the police and navy want to attack the refugees, or if they want to set upon the locals who have stolen everything from around the rim of the camp. Many of the locals have now entered the camp and are taking away whatever they can. The situation is perilous, it is volatile to such an extent that the refugees have been forced to lock the gates from the inside because of the possibility of an attack at any moment. The refugees are in a state of terror, but they have announced that they refuse to quit and leave the camp for Lorengau. After a few hours Senator Nick McKim and an ABC reporter enter the camp. Their presence here has instilled a sense of safety among the refugees. A number of refugees represent the drama that is unfolding here; they shed tears as they stand face-to-face with the ABC cameras. The other refugees feel that those few are reflecting the anguish felt by everyone else, those few shed tears that channel the sorrows of hundreds of refugees. The senator and ABC reporters have now left the camp, and the refugees once again have to grapple with the isolation. As I write, the refugees are engaged in a large meeting inside Delta camp; they have all decided not to leave the prison and continue resisting through peaceful means. The situation has reached a critical juncture, right now there is not enough food and water here – at 5pm they will also cut off the power. The hours that await us are going to be extremely harrowing intensely dangerous. Right now, the atmosphere in the camp is particularly unstable – an attack by the police and navy is imminent. The refugees are drawing on all their resources, their ingenuity and their sense of brotherhood to protect themselves from danger. Everyone realises that they have been abandoned and that this system, and this system alone, will dictate their fate. Constant anxiety, constant terror, constant aggression, constant affliction, unrelenting affliction. There is nowhere to go and various threats encircle the incarcerated refugees – we sense the malignance of the navy, the fury of police, we sense the unpredictability and volatility of the locals. We’re facing all these threats at the same time as feeling a deep sense of abandonment. Recently the refugees have repaired the fences that had been destroyed by the fallen tree in order to restore some security. But the fear of locals entering the camp has become a reality now with numerous people entering the prison and looting it. Security is the greatest danger that we face right now – no one feels safe in any way whatsoever and the threat of an attack looms over the prison and is deteriorating the fortitude of the refugees. Everyone here has gathered in Mike camp to discuss options and strategies – there is no choice but to gather here and find ways to support each other. The only thing left to do is find ways to resist if something were to happen suddenly. We have heard that around 200 locals have also gathered in East Lorengau outside the camp. They are protesting against our transfer to this new facility. They are shouting and protesting against removing us out of the current prison and into their community.

2017-11-29T23:33:51Z,"Muslim population in some EU countries could triple, says report","The Muslim population in some European countries could triple by 2050 while it will barely change in others, according to new projections released by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre. The report, Europe’s Growing Muslim Population, shows a stark west-east divide. The Muslim share of Germany’s population could grow from 6.1% in 2016 to 19.7% in 2050 if high migration continues, whereas over the border Poland’s share would change from 0.1% to 0.2% in the same scenario. Even if all current 28 EU members, plus Norway and Switzerland, closed their borders to migrants, the Muslim population share in the west would continue to grow owing to a younger age profile and higher fertility rates, but remain very low in the east. According to Pew’s data, Muslims made up 4.9% of Europe’s population in 2016, with an estimated 25.8 million people across 30 countries, up from 19.5 million people in 2010. The number of Muslim migrants arriving in Europe surged after 2014 to almost half a million annually, largely due to people fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Researchers considered three scenarios: zero migration between 2016 and 2050; medium migration, in which the flow of refugees stops but people continue to migrate for other reasons; and high migration, in which the record flow of migrants between 2014 and 2016 continues indefinitely with the same religious composition. In the zero migration scenario, the Muslim population in Europe is expected to rise from 4.9% to 7.4%. Apart from Cyprus, which has a high Muslim share (25.4%) due to the historical presence of Turkish Cypriots in the north of the island, France would have Europe’s biggest share of population with 12.7%, up from 8.8%. In the medium migration scenario - perhaps the most likely - Sweden would have the biggest share of population at 20.5%. The UK’s share would rise from 6.3% in 2016 to 16.7%. Finland’s Muslim share would grow from 2.7% to 11.4% and most western European countries would face a big jump. If high migration continues until 2050, Sweden’s Muslim share will grow to 30.6%, Finland’s to 15% and Norway’s to 17%. In eastern Europe, most countries will continue to have a relatively low Muslim share of population, with only Hungary and Greece seeing significant increases from 2016. Apart from migration, the number of Muslims in Europe is set to grow considerably through natural increases. Europe’s Muslims have more children than members of other religious groups, or people of no religion, the study shows. The European average fertility rate is 2.6 for Muslims compared to 1.6 for non-Muslims. The Muslim population is also much younger than non-Muslims. The proportion of Muslims under the age of 15 is 27%, nearly double the proportion of under-15 non-Muslims at 15%. “While Europe’s Muslim population is expected to grow in all three scenarios - and more than double in the medium and high migration scenarios – Europe’s non-Muslims, on the other hand, are projected to decline in total number in each scenario,” says the Pew report. Historically, a relatively small share of migrants to Europe were refugees from violence or persecution, with most coming for other reasons. Nearly half of all recent migrants to Europe were non-Muslims, with Christians making up the next largest group."
2017-11-23T17:00:20Z,Slovenia PM facing impeachment over support for refugee,"The prime minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, one of the few liberal leaders in central and eastern Europe, is facing impeachment over his support for a Syrian asylum seeker who is facing deportation. Should the country’s rightwing opposition party be successful in their motion, Cerar, the leader of the centrist moderate party, could be dismissed from office by the Slovenian MPs, although government sources insist the prime minister has enough support in parliament to vote down the motion. The future of Ahmad Shamieh, a 60-year-old man who arrived in Slovenia in 2015, where he learned the language and became an example of successful refugee integration, has nevertheless become a key dividing line in the country’s politics, whatever the outcome of the impeachment process. Government sources claim the opposition to Cerar’s support of Shamieh is a “staged case” designed to destabilise the government in the run-up to national elections next year. Many tens of thousands of refugees have passed through Slovenia since the refugee crisis began, leading Cerar to claim two years ago that without action to control Europe’s frontiers, the EU would collapse as individual member states took unilateral action. The issue of immigration remains highly controversial in the country. Shamieh’s case took hold of the public imagination when his asylum claim was rejected this summer by the Slovenian courts, which ordered that he should be deported in order to make his application for asylum in Croatia, his first port of call in the EU after leaving Syria. Two prominent MPs, Jan Škoberne, from the leftwing SD party in the coalition government, and Mihe Kordiš, an MP from the leftwing opposition Levica party, took Shamieh to Slovenia’s parliament building to prevent the police from taking him away. When pushed in a press conference last week on his own response to the case, Cerar, who has been prime minister since 2014, suggested that he also wanted to find a way to grant Shamieh residence on the grounds of his integration into Slovenian society. His response prompted claims from rightwingers in the Slovenian parliament that Cerar, a constitutional lawyer, had sought to interfere in the affairs of the independent judiciary. On 15 November the opposition Slovenian Democratic party (SDS), led by Janez Janša, a rightwing former prime minister, announced they would seek to impeach Cerar. Janša, who was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges in 2013, only for the case to be later dismissed by the constitutional court, has previously accused Cerar of being anti-Slovenian, for putting foreigners first. While other eastern European states have boycotted an EU scheme to disperse refugees, Slovenia has taken in 335 people from Greece and Italy out of its EU quota of 567. Cerar has 30 days to answer the charges before a vote in parliament, where the opposition will require a two-thirds majority to carry the motion and force a public court hearing. Only three impeachment motions have been submitted to parliament in the history of the country, founded in 1991 from former Yugoslavia, but none as yet have received a sufficient backing to proceed to the constitutional court. In the course of events, Shamieh has suffered a nervous breakdown and is currently in a psychiatric hospital. He is still expected to be deported to Croatia once he is better, where he will be able to apply to return to Slovenia. Senior Slovenian government sources said, however, that Shamieh’s ill-health may also offer him a right to appeal to the Slovenian court. Slovenian government sources further claimed that the issue had been politicised by both the left and the right to destabilise Cerar’s government in the lead-up to next’s years parliamentary elections. “It is a tragic case,” said one source. “Left and right have used him for their own purposes and the government was squeezed in between. This is a staged affair.”"
2017-08-11T03:09:58Z,Iraqi and Syrian refugees will be settled in Armidale from next year,"The New South Wales regional city of Armidale has volunteered to resettle 200 refugees from Iraq and Syria as part of Australia’s humanitarian migration program next year. The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce announced the move – to his electorate – would begin from February next year. “Armidale is a good fit as a new regional settlement location for humanitarian entrants to Australia,” Joyce said. “It has a strong, welcoming community demonstrated by the fact that this push for the city to be a settlement location for refugees was driven by the community itself. “I have absolutely no doubt that Armidale will work closely with the refugees settling here to ensure they can take up all the opportunities available to those who choose to embrace the great lifestyle available in regional Australia.” Joyce said that many of those settling had endured “unimaginable circumstances which have torn families apart” but that Armidale had the necessary services to support them in integrating in their new country. The overwhelming majority of migrants to Australia – including those who come as refugees – settle in major cities. But refugee resettlement in rural and regional areas has been credited with revitalising country towns socially and economically: in particular places such as Mingoola in northern NSW, which has welcomed three families from Burundi and Congo, and Nhill, which has had more than 160 Karen refugees from Myanmar settle. NSW takes the majority of refugees resettled in Australia, and the bulk of those move to Fairfield City Council in Sydney’s west. That council has said it has struggled to cope with the additional influx of people over the past year. NSW co-ordinator general for refugee resettlement Peter Shergold told a resettlement conference in Sydney that efforts to help settle refugees in rural and regional areas would ease pressure on Fairfield and neighbouring Sydney councils. He said NSW and Australia’s refugee intakes were “eminently manageable”. NSW took more than half of the additional intake of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, in addition to its regular refugee resettlement program. Refugees made up a tiny percentage – 0.14% - of population growth in NSW, Shergold said. “But refugees don’t just distribute across NSW. In this last year, relatively few refugees have gone to Wagga, or Albury or Coffs Harbour, or even to Newcastle or Wollongong. To a very large extent these additional refugees have come to western Sydney… they’ve come to Fairfield. That’s the challenge.” Shergold said the issues facing Fairfield City Council were “acute”, and that a broader spread of resettlement would ease pressure in that area, and, critically, assist refugees in finding employment. “What refugees want is a job. And that has been the most challenging, helping refugees do what they want to do most, which is get employment. “Refugees as a whole bring very significant economic skills... they are risk-takers… they are entrepreneurs. When the ABS does its census it finds the group of Australians most likely to set up family business are people who arrived as refugees.” Shergold welcomed the Armidale announcement, saying the regional city had the necessary infrastructure and support services already in place to help refuges. “This decision has the potential to boost Armidale’s local economy, create new business and most of all, become a template for the kind of Australian mateship the world needs to see.” The new migrants will be housed by Settlement Services International, which is contracted by the Department of Social Services. SSI will also help to find jobs for migrants once they settle in the region."
2017-12-10T03:53:18Z,MPs split as ‘hijacked’ inquiry urges cancellation of young offenders' visas,"Migration benefits Australia economically and socially, however, more English lessons, cultural orientation and community support hubs would help new arrivals and make their settlement easier, a parliamentary inquiry has reported. But, in a disputed recommendation, the inquiry has also called for mandatory cancellation of the visas of migrants, including children, who commit serious crimes. About 190,000 people move to Australia each year under the migration program for skilled and family migrants, split roughly into two-thirds in the skilled streams, and one-third in the family intake. In addition, Australia’s humanitarian migration program accepted 17,555 people in 2015-16. The chairman of the parliamentary joint standing inquiry on migration, Jason Wood, said Australia’s migration program was inarguably a success “and the thousands of people who make their home here each year make a real contribution to society”. “If we are to continue this, we need to focus on early intervention and support programs for new arrivals to make sure they have the best start possible in their new homeland.” Wood, the MP for La Trobe in Melbourne’s east and a former policeman, focused significant attention of the inquiry on the so-called Apex gang, allegedly formed by Sudanese youth, that rose to notoriety in Melbourne after rioting at the Moomba festival in 2016. But Victoria police told the inquiry the gang was a “non-entity” and the majority of its members were born in Australia. Giving evidence, the Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said that, at its peak, the gang consisted of about 130 people loosely affiliated and who came from a broad range of backgrounds. “Predominantly, a large cohort of that gang was, in fact, Australian-born offenders,” he said. Patton said police had “broken the back” of the gang. “We have charged the leaders of that gang and imprisoned them,” he said. “We would call them a non-entity in terms of a gang.” Labor and the Greens criticised the emphasis, saying the entire inquiry had been “hijacked to highlight issues specifically affecting the chair’s own electorate … as such, the report does not reflect the evidence received and ignores the wider context of Australia’s migration situation”. The committee recommended that any visa holder convicted of a crime before a court should be issued with a warning that their ability to become an Australian citizen could be jeopardised by further offending. The committee also recommended that the migration act be amended to mandate the cancellation of the visa of young offenders – aged between 16 and 18 – convicted of a serious violent offence, such a car-jacking or serious assault. “We need to make it clear to those who commit serious and violent crimes that their actions will have consequences,” Wood said, “whether it’s a community protection intervention order, forfeiting eligibility for citizenship or even deportation.” But this recommendation was opposed by Labor and the Greens. Labor argued it “does not objectively reflect the evidence… ignores crucial contextual details and places an undue emphasis on others”, while the Greens said the entire inquiry sought to “demonise particular groups of new migrants”. The committee also recommended broadening and strengthening the scope of section 501 of the migration act, the section used to cancel the visas of people who commit serious crimes in Australia or who, in the view of the minister, fail the “character test” to stay in Australia. The use of section 501 to cancel visas on character grounds has grown exponentially in the past four years, increasing more than tenfold to 1,284 last year. This recommendation was also opposed by non-government committee members. Recommendations from the committee’s report that attracted unanimous support included allowing all migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds access to the government-funded adult migrant English program (Amep) of 510 hours of English lessons and giving migrants longer to enrol, and longer to complete their classes. “Amep’s services need to be more flexible in order to meet the needs of migrants from diverse backgrounds and circumstances,” the report said. “This can be done, in part, by adjusting and extending the eligibility requirements of the Amep, which will improve English language outcomes for migrants.” The inquiry said the community hubs program – 57 hubs are operating across the country – that provides support to newly arrived migrants and other initiatives such as the neighbourhood migrants mothers’ outreach program should be given extra federal government funding. Community hubs improved English skills and child literacy, the inquiry heard, and “also made migrants feel more connected to their community and school and increased their knowledge of community services”."
2017-12-10T03:53:18Z,MPs split as ‘hijacked’ inquiry urges cancellation of young offenders' visas,"Migration benefits Australia economically and socially, however, more English lessons, cultural orientation and community support hubs would help new arrivals and make their settlement easier, a parliamentary inquiry has reported. But, in a disputed recommendation, the inquiry has also called for mandatory cancellation of the visas of migrants, including children, who commit serious crimes. About 190,000 people move to Australia each year under the migration program for skilled and family migrants, split roughly into two-thirds in the skilled streams, and one-third in the family intake. In addition, Australia’s humanitarian migration program accepted 17,555 people in 2015-16. The chairman of the parliamentary joint standing inquiry on migration, Jason Wood, said Australia’s migration program was inarguably a success “and the thousands of people who make their home here each year make a real contribution to society”. “If we are to continue this, we need to focus on early intervention and support programs for new arrivals to make sure they have the best start possible in their new homeland.” Wood, the MP for La Trobe in Melbourne’s east and a former policeman, focused significant attention of the inquiry on the so-called Apex gang, allegedly formed by Sudanese youth, that rose to notoriety in Melbourne after rioting at the Moomba festival in 2016. But Victoria police told the inquiry the gang was a “non-entity” and the majority of its members were born in Australia. Giving evidence, the Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said that, at its peak, the gang consisted of about 130 people loosely affiliated and who came from a broad range of backgrounds. “Predominantly, a large cohort of that gang was, in fact, Australian-born offenders,” he said. Patton said police had “broken the back” of the gang. “We have charged the leaders of that gang and imprisoned them,” he said. “We would call them a non-entity in terms of a gang.” Labor and the Greens criticised the emphasis, saying the entire inquiry had been “hijacked to highlight issues specifically affecting the chair’s own electorate … as such, the report does not reflect the evidence received and ignores the wider context of Australia’s migration situation”. The committee recommended that any visa holder convicted of a crime before a court should be issued with a warning that their ability to become an Australian citizen could be jeopardised by further offending. The committee also recommended that the migration act be amended to mandate the cancellation of the visa of young offenders – aged between 16 and 18 – convicted of a serious violent offence, such a car-jacking or serious assault. “We need to make it clear to those who commit serious and violent crimes that their actions will have consequences,” Wood said, “whether it’s a community protection intervention order, forfeiting eligibility for citizenship or even deportation.” But this recommendation was opposed by Labor and the Greens. Labor argued it “does not objectively reflect the evidence… ignores crucial contextual details and places an undue emphasis on others”, while the Greens said the entire inquiry sought to “demonise particular groups of new migrants”. The committee also recommended broadening and strengthening the scope of section 501 of the migration act, the section used to cancel the visas of people who commit serious crimes in Australia or who, in the view of the minister, fail the “character test” to stay in Australia. The use of section 501 to cancel visas on character grounds has grown exponentially in the past four years, increasing more than tenfold to 1,284 last year. This recommendation was also opposed by non-government committee members. Recommendations from the committee’s report that attracted unanimous support included allowing all migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds access to the government-funded adult migrant English program (Amep) of 510 hours of English lessons and giving migrants longer to enrol, and longer to complete their classes. “Amep’s services need to be more flexible in order to meet the needs of migrants from diverse backgrounds and circumstances,” the report said. “This can be done, in part, by adjusting and extending the eligibility requirements of the Amep, which will improve English language outcomes for migrants.” The inquiry said the community hubs program – 57 hubs are operating across the country – that provides support to newly arrived migrants and other initiatives such as the neighbourhood migrants mothers’ outreach program should be given extra federal government funding. Community hubs improved English skills and child literacy, the inquiry heard, and “also made migrants feel more connected to their community and school and increased their knowledge of community services”."
2017-11-22T07:00:13Z,"'Shocking' political rhetoric on refugees aims to poison debate, UN official warns","The language used to describe people caught up in the migration crisis has been attacked by a special representative of the UN as “deliberately invidious” and aimed at poisoning public debate. Using terms such as “illegal” rather than “irregular” migrants, or “hordes, waves and swarms” rather than simply “large numbers”, conveniently obscures the vulnerabilities that come from being a foreigner, said Louise Arbour, the UN secretary general’s special representative for international migration. Giving a speech at the Overseas Development Institute in London, before member state negotiations on the first global compact on migration, Arbour said it was “quite shocking to see how use of language in an invidious way has poisoned the debate”. British politicians were accused of using racist language about migrants and migration during last year’s referendum on leaving the EU, while former prime minister David Cameron provoked international condemnation when he described migrants in Calais as a “swarm”. In the US, Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has gone even further. Two years ago, he claimed Mexican immigrants were rapists, drug dealers and criminals, a view recently countered by the acting director on immigration and customs, Thomas Homan, who said undocumented immigrants do not commit more crimes than native-born Americans. Arbour, a former UN high commissioner for human rights and former chief prosecutor of war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, said she believed 2017 had brought the “beginning of a change of narrative” on migration. “In this field, as in many others nowadays, reality is much better than perception,” she said. But she criticised “political decision-makers” who were “not particularly well informed” about important, positive aspects of migration, in particular remittances sent home by migrants working overseas. Remittances compete with foreign aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries. “Outside informed circles … knowledge about the impact of remittances, for instance, is often limited,” she said. Politicians often did not know that remittances amounted to more than 20% of GDP in some countries, she said. Neither did they know that in 2016, migrants contributed $429bn (£325bn) in remittances to developing countries – a sum that represented more than three times the total official development assistance. They often had no idea, she went on, that the cost of money transfers could be reduced from 7.5% to 3%, that the UN had promised to achieve that, or what the impact would be of such an achievement on developing countries. “This is something that political decision-makers should be right on top of,” she said. “But I believe this is now starting to be good news. Because this reality, among others, brings the conversations about migration to much better place. In making sound policy, the foundations have to be fact, not perception, fiction myths and stereotypes. “Migration is here to stay and, in absolute numbers, it’s here to grow – and it has to be in everybody’s interest that human mobility is better managed than it is today.” Negotiations on the global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration, one of two compacts agreed by member states as part of the New York declaration in 2016, will start early next year, and should be agreed by July. It is set to be adopted an intergovernmental conference in December 2018."
2017-09-14T04:00:32Z,"The €8,000 ticket: the migrants crossing the Mediterranean by yacht","Only the wealthiest migrants and refugees could afford to pay for a voyage on the 10-metre yacht that sailed under a Ukrainian flag. Today that sailboat is under police guard along with a dozen other luxury vessels impounded at the Sicilian port of Augusta. Its former skipper, Andrej, has recently been released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for aiding illegal immigration. Andrej, 35, a Ukrainian, was convicted for transporting 30 migrants from Turkey to Sicily, landing on a small beach in the province of Syracuse. Each passenger paid more than €8,000 for the crossing. Compared with the inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats used to take migrants and refugees from north Africa across the Mediterranean, the mode of transport that Andrej offered – and others continue to offer – was exclusive and first class. “I saw Syrian doctors, Afghan lawyers and magistrates, Iraqi professors and entrepreneurs [disembarking] from these boats,” said Carlo Parini, the police chief inspector for illegal immigration in the south-eastern port of Syracuse, who led the operations in which the boats were recovered from Turkey and impounded. Some families are known to have paid nearly €100,000 to reach Europe from the Middle East. According to witnesses, some of those who arrived by yacht were dressed elegantly, carrying suitcases and expensive bags. After completing registration procedures on arrival, some went out for dinner at upmarket restaurants nearby. Many of those who have arrived in Sicily by yacht from Turkey are fleeing brutal regimes and conflict, but they are able to pay for a level of safety – even comfort – that thousands of others cannot. More than 120,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, most having departed from Libya bound for Italy, from Turkey bound for Greece or, more recently, from Morocco bound for Spain, usually in shoddy, overcrowded vessels. The Italian route has proven to be the world’s most lethal. Police figures suggest 883 migrants landed inSicily by yacht between January and August this year. There were 682 similar arrivals in 2016. Parini said these figures were estimates. “In reality, there are many more,” he said. “Some of these yachts head to other parts of Italy, such as Leuca, a town in the extreme southern tip of Apulia, close to Sicily. Some manage to disembark the migrants and go back. We cannot monitor every single sailing boat in the Mediterranean. It would be impossible.” Italian authorities believe a Turkish crime ring with links to gangs in Ukraine is behind the luxury landings. The skippers ferrying the passengers on the impounded boats were exclusively Ukrainian and the vessels were registered in Turkey, the US or were rented. Andrej said he left his country to look for work in Europe in order to escape national military service. “I needed to work and I had done a sailing boat course. When they asked me to bring these people to Italy, I accepted,” he told the Guardian, describing his bosses as Turkish. “Like [the passengers], I too had to flee from my country. But unlike them, I did not have the money to pay for yacht crossing. But I knew how to pilot it.” Though controversial measures taken by the Italian government have led to a drop in the numbers of new arrivals in the past two months, hundreds of people continue to land in Sicily and southern Italy each week, according to authorities. Many are finding new routes and landing points to evade the tighter security measures. On the west coast of Sicily, large motorboats and motor-powered inflatables fly at high speed across the waters of the Mediterranean, carrying families of migrants and refugees from the ports of Tunisia to the provinces of Trapani and Agrigento. For their landings, they choose the most deserted beaches to avoid police controls. Last June, the Guardia di Finanza (Italy’s finance police) in Palermo discovered a wave of clandestine journeys from Tunisia to Sicily using rapid boats capable of reaching the island in less than four hours, with passage costing €2,000-€3,000 per person. The traffickers were earning about €50,000 per journey. The police operation brought about the arrest of 15 Tunisian and Italian nationals. At the beginning of the year, coastguard officers in Agrigento and Trapani stopped two rafted motorboats near the coast. On board were Tunisian families including a 12-year-old child. One of the speedboats was equipped with three 400-horsepower marine outboard motors, which are normally used for racing boats and are capable of pushing boats to speeds of up 90mph – faster than any vessel available to the coastguards. “That sort of boat could reach Sicily from Tunisia in a few hours,” said Salvatore Vella, a prosecutor in Agrigento who has led some of the most significant investigations into people-smuggling in Sicily. Vella said some people smugglers operated like “illegal travel agencies”. He said: “Like the legal ones, they offer first-, second- and third-class journeys. It depends how much money you can pay.”"
2017-12-17T23:27:56Z,Refugee advocates blockade Melbourne port in protest at offshore detention,"Protesters have blockaded Melbourne’s container port in opposition to Australia’s offshore immigration detention regime. The port – Australia’s busiest – was blockaded at three entrances on Monday morning, with protesters blocking road entrances and unveiling a banner that read: “All refugees in detention are political prisoners.” Three climbers suspended themselves above three road entrances to the port and refused to come down. “Today we are taking action against Australia’s border policy, which remains open to corporate profits, yet is violently closed to those seeking safety,” said SOS Manus spokeswoman Charlotte Lynch. “We support the calls made by refugees and ex-detainees for international sanctions to be placed on Australia until the people on Manus are free.” The protest has caused significant traffic delays around the port. Victoria police are at the site. A spokeswoman for Victoria police said there would be a police presence at the rally to maintain public safety. “People have every right to protest. However, we ask that they do so peacefully and without impacting on the rest of the community,” she said. “Police will be monitoring the rally to ensure there are no breaches of the peace or crimes occurring.” The deal to resettle refugees from Australian detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru in the United States is progressing on both sides. Close to 200 refugees – about 60 from Manus and 130 from Nauru – will move to the US in January. Fifty-four refugees were moved in September. But the newly reinstated travel ban imposed by the US president, Donald Trump, excludes people of certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranians are the largest national group on both Manus and Nauru. The US could take up to 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore camps – not enough to clear them – but it’s unclear precisely how many it will ultimately accept. Australia’s return obligation – to take central American refugees from refugee camps in Costa Rica – has also begun. Thirty people from seven families have moved to Australia after several months of assessment by the immigration department. It is understood they fled gang-related violence in El Salvador and had been living in hiding before being transferred to Costa Rica. The number of refugees fleeing criminal violence in the “northern triangle” countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has escalated in recent years: nearly 10% of the 30 million people who live in those countries have fled across borders because of extortion, rape and forced gang recruitment after decades of civil war and conflict. Most of those displaced are fleeing north towards Mexico and the US. The US runs refugee camps in Costa Rica and has brokered assistance in resettling people from there. The US refugee deal was agreed between the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and former US president Barack Obama in November 2016. Trump has described the arrangement as a “dumb deal” and lambasted Turnbull over it during a fractious phone call in January. His administration, however, has insisted the deal will be upheld."
2017-12-18T16:26:10Z,Bristol refugee murder review accuses police of institutional racism,"The family of an Iranian refugee murdered by a vigilante after years of abuse have expressed relief that an independent review has vindicated their campaign to expose institutional racism within a police force and council. A review concluded that Avon and Somerset police and Bristol city council wrongly perceived Bijan Ebrahimi as a troublemaker rather than a victim and sided with his white abusers. Ebrahimi’s family emphasised the significance of the review’s finding of institutional racism – the most explicit against a police force since the 1999 Macpherson report on the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in London, and the first of its kind against a local authority. Both organisations accepted the findings of the report by the Safer Bristol Partnership and said they would continue to work with Ebrahimi’s family to tackle the failings. Ebrahimi’s sisters, Mojgan Khayatian and Manizhah Moores, said it was important their deep concerns had been officially recognised, more than four years after their brother’s death. They said: “Bijan always fought for the truth, which is what we have tried to do in his name. He never gave up on trying to make things better and neither will we. “It’s been a long battle. No review can ever bring back our beloved Bijan but it is important that his voice has been heard. Bijan always said that racism must be challenged wherever it is found, including in town halls and police stations.” Ebrahimi, 44, was punched and kicked to death by his neighbour Lee James, who had mistakenly thought he was a paedophile. James and another neighbour dragged Ebrahimi’s body to a green in front of his home in Brislington, south Bristol, doused him with white spirit and set fire to him. James was jailed for life. Avon and Somerset police apologised in the summer after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said in a report that the force had failed Ebrahimi. The force has been working with his sisters to try to improve its procedures. It said on Monday: “Mr Ebrahimi was treated differently, to his detriment and without objective reason.” Ebrahimi’s family said the council had been slow to acknowledge its failings. “Bristol city council took nearly five years to accept it failed Bijan and the need for change. This is far too long, although late is better than never. We will not rest until improved systems are put in place to protect other vulnerable people,” they said. The new report says Ebrahimi’s death left a “hole in the lives of his sisters and young nephews that they feel can never be filled”. It adds: “They feel an indescribable emptiness and their lives will never be the same again.” The sisters said they would never have got to the truth without the support of the Bristol agency Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI) and their lawyers. “We worry about bereaved families who don’t have that support. How do they ever find the truth? We now look forward to working with the mayor and holding the council to account.” Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, apologised, accepted there had been institutional racism and said he would work with Ebrahimi’s family to try to prevent the occurrence of another such tragedy. The multi-agency learning review spells out that from 2005 until his death in 2013, Ebrahimi reported dozens of times that he had been the victim of racially motivated offending. He made about 44 allegations to the police that he had been the victim of a crime or multiple crimes, the report says. These included 17 recorded allegations of assault, seven of threats to kill, five of harassment, five of criminal damage, 12 of public order-related offences and one of cruelty to an animal – his cat Mooshi. On one occasion boiling water was thrown over his head; he was also the victim of an arson attack. One relative told the review she had witnessed him being called a “Paki” and a “cockroach” and being told: “Go back to your own country.” But before Ebrahimi’s death only one person was convicted of an offence – in relation to the scalding incident. The report says: “There is evidence that Mr Ebrahimi was repeatedly targeted for racist abuse and victimisation by some members of the public, that this was repeatedly reported to Avon and Somerset constabulary and Bristol city council and that representatives of both organisations repeatedly sided with his abusers. “The more incidents that were reported, the more ingrained this pattern of responses became.” Ebrahimi himself was arrested on 15 occasions from the date of his arrival in the UK in 2001 but was never prosecuted. On one occasion, Bristol city council obtained an antisocial behaviour order against him rather than against the neighbours he was complaining about. The report says this was “misconceived and served as official confirmation of his perceived status as the primary perpetrator rather than the primary victim”. It says there was an incorrect prevailing view among some neighbours that Ebrahimi was a paedophile. “The authorities were aware of that view, took no steps to correct it and it is possible that the silence of agencies on this may have been taken by some as confirmation of local suspicions,” the report says. “On occasions, Mr Ebrahimi was treated with disrespect and even contempt by some police officers,” it continues. The report concludes: “Those victimising him were overwhelmingly of white European origin and the neighbourhoods within which he lived were predominantly inhabited by residents of white European origin … Bijan Ebrahimi was isolated. His complaints resulted in little action. “As an Iranian man living in this environment, Mr Ebrahimi was disadvantaged by the inappropriate responses by Avon and Somerset constabulary and Bristol city council to his racist victimisation. “Representatives of those organisations displayed a distinct lack of understanding of his plight and, accordingly, unwitting prejudice against him.” The report sets out a definition of institutional racism from the Macpherson report: “The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.” The Ebrahimi report says: “There is therefore, based on the above definition from the Macpherson report, evidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol city council and Avon and Somerset constabulary.” The family’s solicitor, Tony Murphy, of Bhatt Murphy, said: “Acknowledging the institutional nature of the racism at the core of this tragedy is an essential first step towards systemic change.” Two members of the Avon and Somerset force – PC Kevin Duffy, a beat manager, and Andrew Passmore, a community support officer – were jailed for misconduct in a public office over their dealings with Ebrahimi. They and two other constables, Leanne Winter and Helen Harris, have been dismissed from the force."
2017-07-04T19:01:48Z,The Guardian view on the return of the migrant boats: Europe’s problem | Editorial,"High summer is migrant season in the Mediterranean. In rising numbers, men, women and children set off in the flimsiest of craft for Italy. So far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration, at least 2,000 people have drowned in the attempt. This is made all the worse by the equivocation and even the hostility of EU states which make little show of solidarity; today Austria announced it was ready to send troops and tanks to stop migrants crossing the border from Italy. The Mediterranean is already the world’s worst maritime cemetery. Italy, which finds itself on the receiving end of this migration, urgently needs more European support than is currently on offer. Lest anyone doubt it, this applies to the UK government too: last year, only 13,000 asylum claims were granted. The numbers are not as staggering as they were, but this year’s migration crisis is no less tragic and no less diplomatically fraught. The number entering Europe by sea so far is 100,000, half last year’s number for the same period. Four-fifths of them arrived in Italy. Migrant centres are overwhelmed. The Italian government says the situation is “unbearable”. Last week it threatened to close its ports to ships used by NGOs to rescue migrants. It wants other coastline states – Spain and France – to offer points of arrival. A flurry of EU meetings – with another one due on Thursday in Tallinn – has so far produced little concrete help, while a proposed EU “code of conduct” for NGOs risks limiting their action. NGOs are furious that their humanitarian work has been described as creating a “pull factor”: they say that is finger-pointing rather than tackling the real issues. It is to Italy’s credit that, in 2013, it became the first European country to launch a life-saving operation, Mare Nostrum. Since then, search and rescue operations have been internationalised. But little has been done to make the welcoming effort a genuinely Europe-wide one. Refugee relocation plans have been more of a concept than a reality. To date, an EU plan originally intended for tens of thousands has led to the resettlement of only 7,354 people from Italy. Yet, although Italy’s frustration is understandable, blocking humanitarian ships cannot be the right answer. There are more sustainable solutions. It is lack of political will that makes them unattainable. EU migration policies need to be overhauled. Fear of a populist backlash leaves governments wary of creating the safe, legal routes that would allow an orderly processing of asylum claims. Not all migrants are entitled to asylum, but all asylum claims must be fairly examined. Crisis management that centres on border control, even if it is pushed back to Libya’s southern borders, is not enough. Outsourcing the problem to Libya’s coastguards or militias only makes it worse. The UNHCR says there is “no slowing down” of migrant movements to Libya. That is likely to mean ever larger numbers trying to travel the central Mediterranean route to Europe. Last year’s EU-Turkey agreement managed to stem migrant and refugee movements across the Aegean Sea, but to a large extent it has only displaced the problem. It is no surprise that Libya, a country of three competing governments, plunged in internal chaos, has become a network of ruthless and sometimes murderous traffickers, and the new flashpoint. The mounting concerns of the centre-left government in Rome may not be motivated only by human tragedy, but also by the fear that uncontrolled migration will help either the far right or the Five Star movement make gains in the coming elections. Europe has a collective interest in thwarting such an outcome, just as it does in upholding its commitment to the principle of asylum. That can only be done through coordination across the EU. Migration is a long-term problem. But with the so-called summer season under way, pledges of solidarity must urgently be translated into action. Italy’s problems are not only Italian but European too."
2017-12-03T00:05:26Z,"‘Marcin was crying, begging for help’: crisis of EU migrants detained in the UK","He was one of B-wing’s most popular characters, although recently other detainees had noticed a sudden darkening in his mood. A little before 5pm on 3 September, two days before his 28th birthday, Marcin Gwozdzinski made a final plea for help. Addressing officials inside the administrative quarters of Harmondsworth immigration removal centre, he told them he could no longer cope. “He was crying, begging for help from the guards, telling them to call an ambulance, that his mental health was an emergency,” said another detainee, Marcin Malicki, who sat beside Gwozdzinski in the meeting. “They told him he would get no help and to stop calling for an ambulance,” said Malicki, 37, who was there as a translator. “He broke down like a baby. Still they did nothing.” Shortly after 7pm, Gwozdzinski asked if he could borrow a Qur’an, a request Malicki thought was peculiar from a devout Catholic, the latest clue, perhaps, that his friend was losing his mind. Other detainees wondered why he was not on suicide watch, or at least antidepressants. At 2.05pm the next day Malicki heard shrieking from inmates huddled outside the door of room 10, B-wing – Gwozdzinski’s cell. Malicki found his friend barely alive. He tried to revive him. “I still carry his face in my head, all the time I see him,” he recalls. Gwozdzinski’s was one of three deaths linked to the UK’s immigration detention estate in the space of a month. This year is the deadliest on record – 10 immigration detainees have died, twice the previous high. News of the latest emerged two weeks ago – another suicide, a 27-year-old Iraqi man inside Lincolnshire’s Morton Hall detention facility. Few other details have surfaced, but critics say such secrecy is the norm. Of the 10 deaths, three of their names are not known. Occasionally, the Home Office fails even to publicise a death. One recent Freedom of Information response found two deaths of which campaigners had no previous knowledge. In keeping with such a clandestine climate, the Home Office has not released Gwozdzinski’s name, or even his age. Until now, who he was or the circumstances of his death were a mystery. Gwozdzinski’s family claim they are being kept in the dark, that his death was preventable but that its circumstances are being covered up. Beyond dispute is that the tragedy arrives during a particularly contentious period for the UK’s immigration detention estate, specifically its ongoing role in the detention and deportation of European Union citizens from the UK following the Brexit vote. Home Office data released on Thursday confirmed 5,321 EU nationals were forcibly removed in the year until September, a 13% increase on statistics already at their highest since records began. Celia Clarke, director of the charity Bail for Immigration Detainees believes Brexit has given the Home Office the green light to target Europeans in the UK, an allegation corroborated by claims that EU citizens are being detained for relatively minor crimes, such as driving offences. “If you have a government that unashamedly vows to create a ‘hostile environment’ then it is no surprise that people are swept up, detained and removed, with little regard to their rights,” said Clarke. Her organisation is fighting the deportation of 70 EU nationals – two thirds of whom have no criminal record and whose average stay in the UK is 11.4 years. Also on Thursday, the former Tory international development secretary Andrew Mitchell became the latest public figure to voice concern over the purpose of the UK’s 11 immigration centres, denouncing them as a “dystopian stain on our democracy”. Another dimension is unfolding that is driving further disquiet: the allegedly systematic clearance of homeless EU nationals from British streets. The numbers affected are unclear – despite FoI requests, the Home Office refuses to publish updated numbers – but Clarke believes the amount of Europeans targeted under this policy may roll into the thousands. A high court judge will rule next month whether the policy is lawful. Gwozdzinski and Malicki were both homeless when detained. More are being swept up all the time. The edict has caused consternation among diplomats. Vali Staicu, third secretary at the Romanian embassy, said her country had raised the issue with the home secretary Amber Rudd last month. “We are very concerned, we have cases where the Home Office say it’s a voluntary return but when we ask, the individual says, ‘I don’t want to go.’” The Slovak embassy was worried about people being detained and deported without “legitimate reason”. Sources at the Polish embassy, which represents 831,000 Polish-born UK residents, making Poles the largest overseas-born group in the country, would only confirm “cooperation” with the Home Office on the issue. Born in the remote town of Cibórz, near Świebodzinin west Poland, Gwozdzinski – the youngest of seven brothers – was an adventurous child. As a boy he explored the surrounding spruce forests, travelling across Poland as a teenager, then Europe, Ireland, eventually arriving in the UK aged 23. Travel, he told his family, helped “keep his spirit free”. His brother Grzegorz, 30, said: “He loved new countries, new people, and although he was a hard worker he enjoyed sleeping rough – squats, empty buildings, anywhere.” In October last year and despite working on a building site in Tooting, south London, Gwozdzinski had elected to sleep rough near Streatham Common. He smoked cannabis to help him sleep and one evening approached dealers near Streatham’s St Leonard’s Church to stock up on supplies. Gwozdzinski was short-changed, a scuffle broke out that was caught on CCTV. The following morning, he was arrested and taken to Harmondsworth. Quick witted and gregarious, he was quickly dubbed by B-wing as Siwy, which translates as light blond in Polish. He had no history of mental illness and was generally happy. His family had never contemplated that he might one day try to kill himself. Three months on and no official account into the events around his death has been issued. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) is investigating but will not comment, while the Home Office says it is “inappropriate” to share statements on an ongoing PPO inquiry. Mitie, the private firm that runs Harmondsworth on behalf of the Home Office, declined to answer questions. However, corroborating witness statements indicate that Gwozdzinski begged for help repeatedly over a period of time. Another Polish detainee on B-wing, Robert Legut, 52, describes Gwozdzinski telling staff on several occasions that his mental health was deteriorating profoundly. “He was saying: ‘Help me please, my head is no good. I might do something, suicidal.’ He told guards five days beforehand, two or three times. They ignored him.” Speaking in the spartan, heavily securitised meeting room inside Harmondsworth, the rumble of flights from nearby Heathrow airport in the background, Legut said Gwozdzinski’s death was avoidable. “He went back to get help but they laughed at him again. He was desperate, why did they not give him a psychologist? His death is the Home Office’s fault.” A written statement, signed by 59 fellow detainees of various nationalities, unequivocally blames the death of their “friend” on the authorities. “For a long time he [Gwozdzinski] asked officers, psychologists and doctors for help. He was ignored,” states the carefully handwritten letter. “Many times he asked for help. Therefore myself and other detainees are very anxious and depressed about the situation. It is a disgrace that nobody has been [made] accountable for such poor care. We are human beings not animals.” In a letter written by Gwozdzinski shortly before his death, he says: “I can’t be here. I want to be free … there is not much time left.” The partner of Gwozdzinski’s brother, Ewa Jany, says detainees have described how Gwozdzinski’s roommate would stand over him at night, reciting Satanic verses. “We heard how his cellmate would stand over Marcin at night talking about witches and Satan. Marcin was having terrible nightmares, it is no surprise.” Days before Gwozdzinski tried to kill himself, he asked the centre’s authorities to be moved. But Jany believes it was too late: the damage had been done. “He needed special supervision, there are staff who follow inmates with psychological problems. They even follow them to the toilet. Why did Marcin get no one?” Wider, structural issues may have played a part. Britain remains the only country in Europe with no time limit on immigration detention. With detainees’ lives in limbo, psychologists agree that the system affects mental health. Two years ago MPs joined campaigners in urging a 28-day limit on immigration detention, and only then as an “absolute last resort”. Legut, who says he was detained for minor motoring offences, has been held since January. Malicki was held for nearly a year, the same as Gwozdzinski. All three registered mental health complaints, but none was given antidepressants or psychological assistance. When the Observer met Legut inside Harmondsworth, his arms were covered in a blood-encrusted latticework of self-inflicted cuts. During our conversation, Legut, who has lived in Scotland for 12 years, ran a finger across his throat to mimic a neighbouring detainee who had cut his throat days earlier. Legut texted twice during the following three weeks with details of others who had self-harmed, and these were just among his 14 Polish friends. Suicide attempts are rising across the immigration detention estate. According to data from campaigners, 132 attempts were recorded during the first quarter of this year, a rate that could eclipse the record of 393 in 2015. Legut believes the rise is bolstered by the prevalence of the synthetic drug spice, linked to psychotic episodes and erratic behaviour. Although spice’s ubiquity inside prisons is widely chronicled, its spread inside immigration centres is not. Malicki says spice was easily obtainable in Harmondsworth and that Gwozdzinski was a user, although its influence in his decline is ambiguous. “I asked staff why they were letting so much Spice inside – people were going crazy – but they said, ‘You stop one dealer and another will take their place.’” Emma Ginn, coordinator of Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of detainees, said her organisation had frequently warned the Home Office that conditions inside would lead to further deaths if not addressed. “Clients call us, petrified that they too might die,” she said. “They say the authorities don’t care whether they live or die. We can’t console them.” Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said: “Deaths and self-harm are the human consequences of the UK’s dehumanising and unjust detention system.” Gwozdzinski’s seemingly swift decline has been difficult for his family to digest. He had been talking about his future – accepting that he might need some stability according to his brother Grzegorz – but was also in peak physical condition. When his mother, who lost another son in a car accident in Poland seven years earlier, accepted medical advice and turned off her youngest’s life support machine at 6.40pm on 7 September, Gwozdzinski’s heart kept beating unaided for 25 minutes. “Two nurses were there and they were very surprised. His heart must have been so strong, but the brain was too damaged,” said Jany. Since then, the family allege attempts to work out what happened inside Harmondsworth have been obstructed. After Gwozdzinski’s death, key witnesses were deported. Despite nearly 12 months in detention, the prime witness Malicki was sent to Poland within days. Weeks later, when the Observer finally tracked him down, he was in Iceland. Legut said four witnesses had been deported or “ghosted” to other centres. A month after Gwozdzinski’s death, Legut revealed how one witness was flown to Poland at 8am, two hours before a case hearing. “It was too fast a decision to send them away; they are silenced,” he said. Neither Malicki nor Legut have been interviewed by investigators charged with finding out what happened. There are also allegations that the Home Office attempted to keep Gwozdzinski’s suicide bid quiet. Four hours after the attempt, at 6pm on Sunday, Jany and Grzegorz were notified he was in hospital. Throughout the following day, the Home Office refused to confirm claims that a detainee was on a life support machine. That night the BBC aired a damning documentary showing guards at another removal centre mistreating vulnerable people, including those who were suicidal. Another four days would pass before the Home Office confirmed something had happened. Detainees were sent a note citing an “incident” involving a “Polish detainee” who had died. Legut was among those kept in the dark. “They didn’t even tell his friends.” The sense that the Home Office is covering up the deaths of other EU nationals is shared. Eight months after Slovenian Branko Zdravkovic, 43, killed himself in a Dorset immigration detention centre, his partner, Nicola Sanderson, says she is still waiting for answers, but believes he was not given the care he needed. Zdravkovic, she says, was detained following a sweep of east Europeans drinking on a street in central London. Once inside, his wellbeing disintegrated. “They didn’t contact me at all, it’s disgraceful. My Branko was born in a quiet village near Austria and comes to this country, works for years, and this is how he was treated,” said Sanderson, from west London. Other aspects of Gwozdzinski’s case have prompted unease. Two days after his suicide attempt, Jany received a call from Harmondsworth informing her that Gwozdzinski was to be released. The official explained, says Jany, that he was no longer considered a threat to the community. “I actually started laughing, it was so ridiculous. Marcin was brain-damaged in a coma.” Another twist emerges with claims that staff apparently told Gwozdzinski that weeks before his death he was to be released. “The Home Office told him he was free to go. But they didn’t release him,” said Legut. Jany said they were actually preparing for his homecoming. “What was odd is that Marcin called and asked for our address. He said the Home Office would release him if he could provide an address that they could then check.” For three weeks Gwozdzinski called Jany daily, eagerly inquiring if the Home Office had called. “We were ready for them to check our house but nothing happened. I think this eventually broke him down.” Such episodes have left the Gwozdzinskis asking if the death of Siwy, a free spirit crushed by detention, can be tied to Theresa May’s ongoing “hostile environment” against those she believes should not be in the country. Jany said: “The Home Office behaves as if it is scared of Polish people. We need to know why Marcin was detained for so long, why he hanged himself.” In the UK and Republic of Ireland, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123"
2017-12-08T00:30:25Z,The gentrification of Beijing: razing of migrant villages spells end of China dream,"Inside the shell of one of dozens of derelict buildings in this condemned migrant community, a cinnabar-coloured calendar was nailed to the wall, adorned with the face of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his inescapable political slogan: “CHINA DREAM”. Outside, as night fell and roadside puddles hardened into black ice, rural migrants who had come to China’s capital chasing pavements of gold set about dismantling their own. In the village of Sanyingmen, a family of restaurateurs from Anhui, one of east China’s poorest regions, load the fruits of their labour onto the back of a van: a mattress, a wardrobe, a grease-stained cooking pot. A man from Jiangxi province scavenges internet cables from a heap of demolished shacks, having been given 24-hours to vacate his home. Such scenes are playing out across Beijing after authorities launched a 40-day housing crackdown following a deadly tenement fire on the city’s southern outskirts which killed 19 people, eight of them children. Activists believe authorities are using that blaze as a pretext to accelerate ongoing efforts to drive tens of thousands of “low-end” migrant workers out of the city. Beside a sea of bricks that had been the heart of a once-bustling settlement, a man takes aim at his president’s pledge to rule as a champion of the poor. “I think what is happening is that ... Xi Jinping has water in his head,” he fumes, a teary eye giving way to anger as he recounts how officials gave Sanyingmen’s residents until 7am the next day to leave. “I’ve no idea what the China dream really means,” the 40-year-old says. “My nights are sleepless. How can I possibly dream?” Some activists suspect even more sinister motives lie behind the mass eviction and demolition campaign, such as grabbing valuable land in gentrifying areas of the city. In recent years property prices have rocketed in Daxing, a region of southern Beijing that has been the focus of much of the wrecking. The city’s new international airport – an 80bn yuan (£9bn) mega-structure designed by Zaha Hadid Architects – is set to open there in 2019. “The Chinese [authorities] have a way of being brutal that is often related to a very substantive project,” says Saskia Sassen, a Columbia University sociologist whose latest book, Expulsions, examines the driving forces behind such evictions. “Yes, [driving out the poor] is definitely always in there – but is there also something else?” City officials deny they are seeking to banish Beijing’s estimated 8 million migrant workers and claim their focus is saving lives by clamping down on illegal, unsafe and overcrowded buildings. Last week Beijing’s Communist party chief announced that ensuring safety and stability was now his “biggest political task”. But the scenes of migrants being driven from their drab rented homes – captured in heart-wrenching smartphone videos – have sparked public outrage just weeks after Xi began his second term promising citizens a “new era” of power and prosperity. “It is a humanitarian crisis,” says Zhang Lifan, an outspoken political commentator involved in a petition condemning the government’s treatment of people he calls refugees. Having helped make Beijing a bustling metropolis, the factory workers, maids, builders and couriers now being uprooted deserve more than “arrogance, discrimination and humiliation”, the appeal states. Beijing’s housing crackdown – which began months before the recent fire but appears to have intensified dramatically since – has reduced swaths of the city’s dilapidated periphery to a clutter of rebar and concrete. From busy neighbourhoods to deserted wreckage Xinjian village, a once-teeming neighbourhood of garment factories and migrant dwellings where the deadly fire broke out, is now half-ghost town, half-disaster zone, its buildings either emptied of life by squads of black-clad police or levelled completely by diggers. “I’ve lost everything,” complains Cao Bo, a 34-year-old hairdresser from Anhui, as he clears out his recently opened salon in the community. Further on, a cluster of Chinese artists regard the epicentre of the devastation with a mixture of disgust and enthralment. Anita Guo, a 30-year-old visual artist, says the group came seeking inspiration for a politically charged art project. “It’s a man-made earthquake ... Our government is just thinking in a really weird, weird way,” she says. Another member of the collective, Xi Lin, says some suspected the fire was being used as an excuse to purge the poor: “It’s fucked up ... inhuman.” Xi describes the evictions as part of a broader bid to control Beijing’s 20 million-plus population and “beautify” its traffic-clogged streets. “I like the vision they have. They want to turn Beijing into a ... less crowded, more green place,” she says. “But I think the method is too harsh. Way too harsh.” Moments later, a local man races past on an electric bicycle, shouting: “Take more photographs! The Chinese Communist party is inhuman!” Crowd-sourced online maps show how the mass evictions and demolitions – which some claim have affected as many as 100,000 people – have upended lives right across this Asian mega-city. In Banjieta village, on Beijing’s north-western fringe, scavengers comb through the ruins of another recently felled housing estate. “They just want us to go home,” says Wang Qin, a 46-year-old recycler from Henan province. “These officials and Xi Jinping: they don’t want the poor living here.” Nearby, Zheng Yuzhi, a migrant from Shandong, dug a grave-like shelter into another recently cleared area, having lost her home to the wrecking ball and then her savings, when she was robbed. “I’ve got no money ... no way to go home,” laments Zheng, 59, who spent a decade sweeping Beijing’s streets but now sleeps under a tatty placard in the dirt. In Xibanbidian, another north-western village, children file out of a recently condemned kindergarten past a field of wreckage that had once been low-cost migrant housing. “The government has abandoned us,” says Peng Jia, 33, a mother of two from Hunan who recalls seeing thousands of labourers streaming out of the area last weekend after they were ordered to leave. “The supermarkets have closed. The school is shutting down. Everything is closing down,” Peng adds. “It is so unfair. But nobody comes here to listen to us – nobody hears our voices.” ‘If they want you to go, you have to go’ Back in Sanyingmen, residents prepare for their last night in the urban village. Red spray paint had been used to daub the Chinese character chai (拆) – demolish – on to those buildings which had not already been torn down. A stroll through one already-levelled section underlined the suddenness with which the community’s population had been dislodged. Beds and belongings lie buried under layers of timber and rubble; family photographs and posters still cling to walls; already precarious lives interrupted by the blitzkrieg of wrecking. Li Yanhong, a 30-year-old evictee, says he had little choice but to return to his home in Jiangxi. “By tomorrow there will be no one left,” he sighs. “I’m angry, but what can I do? If they want you to go, you have to go.” Others voice indignation and despair as the curtains come down on their struggle to build a Chinese dream. “I’ve got no home to go back to … tomorrow I won’t have anywhere to sleep,” says Li’s neighbour, a migrant from Anhui who asked not to be named. “I feel panic, in my heart and in my mind.” Two months ago, Xi ordered officials to make good on the Communist party’s “solemn pledge” to care for China’s masses: “We should see that our people will always have a strong sense of fulfilment, happiness and security.” This week, Sanyingmen’s residents were stripped of all three.

2017-08-22T04:47:37Z,Australia resettles Cuban refugees found clinging to lighthouse off Florida Keys,"Seventeen refugees who were found clinging to a lighthouse off the Florida Keys after fleeing Cuba in a self-made raft, and then were sent to Guantánamo Bay for a year, have been resettled in Brisbane. Under the United States’s “wet foot, dry foot” policy, which Barack Obama ended in January as part of improving relations between the two countries, Cuban asylum seekers were immediately allowed to stay and apply to become legal residents if they landed on American soil. However, those intercepted at sea were returned to Cuba or taken to a migration centre at Guantánamo Bay for assessment. A legal challenge was launched to determine if the lighthouse, anchored to a reef under 1.3m of water, seven nautical miles south of Sugarloaf Key, was US territory under the policy. A federal court ruled against the asylum seekers’ claim. The group was sent to Guantánamo. The case made headlines across the US and Latin America. “We crossed the ocean trying to arrive in the States,” Alexander Vergara Lopez told Guardian Australia. “We were 24 guys but when we were crossing the ocean the boat was broken … When we saw the lighthouse, we hopped on the lighthouse and then it was crazy. “The relationship between Cuba and the United States is not the best. We happen to be normal people, members of the public, but we started to appear in social media and many other communications.” Of the lighthouse cohort, 20 were reportedly found to have refugee claims and remained in Guantánamo, awaiting third-country resettlement through the US’s Migration Operations Centre. While at the MOC naval station, migrants are assisted by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), including in finding work on the base. Five months ago the group was informed they had been accepted for resettlement in Australia and they arrived in Brisbane at the end of last month, after travelling via the Dominican Republic, France and Dubai. Upon arrival in Brisbane Vergara Lopez praised Australia as a “very free place”, saying: “It’s a dream – we are very happy, we have a million thanks for our lawyers [in the Democracy Movement in Miami].” Ramón Sánchez, the leader of the Florida-based Democracy Movement, which led the group’s legal challenge said: “The 17 Cubans of the American shoal lighthouse case have already landed in Australia, happy to finally attain full freedom.” Refugee resettlement is a politically fraught topic in both Australia and the US, and two separate arrangements between the countries have been labelled a “people swap”. In September Turnbull announced a protection transfer arrangement with the US to take refugees from Costa Rican camps as part of Australia’s annual humanitarian intake. The arrangement is between the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, IOM and settlement countries including Australia and the US. Currently US officials are also assessing refugees held in Australia’s offshore detention centres as part of an agreement to resettle up to 1,200 people. Australia refuses to resettle any asylum seeker who arrived by boat after 19 July 2013. The agreement between the Australian government and Obama has been controversial. Under the arrangement the US doesn’t technically have to take any refugees – which Turnbull assured the president, Donald Trump, of in a phone call, the transcript of which was leaked. Trump expressed disgust at the “bad deal”. Turnbull also said Australia would take “anyone” the US wanted it to take in return. “We are taking people from the previous administration that they were very keen on getting out of the United States,” he told Trump. “We will take more.” It remains unclear who the “people” are or why the US was “very keen” to get them out of the country. In May, Australia’s Senate estimates learned that, under the Costa Rica agreement, seven cases involving 30 people were going through regular screening processes for resettlement in Australia. At the same time the department was also going through a tranche of Cuban refugee placements as part of Australia’s “periodical” assistance of the US, Mandy Newton, the deputy commissioner of Australian Border Force, told estimates. It is not known which agreement the 17 Cubans arrived under and Australian and US officials decline to comment on specific cases. The Australian immigration department said Australia and the US had “a long history of cooperation on mutual and respective humanitarian objectives”, including resettling Cuban refugees. “These refugees were assessed by Australian government officials and met the criteria for refugee and humanitarian visas, including rigorous health, character and security checks,” the spokeswoman said. A US state department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual cases but said 445 people had been resettled in third countries through the Guantánamo-based Migration Operations Centre since 1996. The vast majority were Cubans. “Protected migrants are neither detained, imprisoned, nor held, and are free at any time to return to their country of origin,” she said. “Most, however, choose to stay at the MOC until a resettlement opportunity arises.” Vergara Lopez said he didn’t know why he and the other 16 Cuban refugees couldn’t stay in the US, but hoped an appeal – currently before the courts – would allow them the option of returning. “Maybe if we win the case we can leave Australia and go to the States,” he said. He has a grandmother and a four-year-old son in Cuba but Vergara Lopez had hoped to go to the US to live with his mother in Florida. If not, he said he was happy to stay in Brisbane and was grateful for the welcome and support of Australia. “I like it here, it’s a nice place. If I have to stay here all my life, I will. I like it,” he said. “Right now I’m working for a company … they are teaching me right now. [Australia] is a good place, I like it, very nice people.”"
2017-12-13T15:41:58Z,Artist hangs refugees' clothing in London church to highlight crisis,"A baby’s bright red bib emblazoned with the words “My 1st Christmas Ever!” Pyjama tops with sleeve ends intertwined like holding hands. A pair of jeans upside down as though their owner is falling from a height. Shoes, socks, mittens, hats. A long, winding, blue patterned scarf. These are among 700 items of refugees’ clothing salvaged from beaches and olive groves on the Greek island of Lesbos and hung in an installation by the British war artist Arabella Dorman in the nave of St James’s church in Piccadilly, London. Dorman has called her artwork Suspended, reflecting both the powerful and poignant display of clothing and the state of limbo experienced by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and misery. Dorman first visited Lesbos in 2015, after earlier spending time on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. “But nothing compared me for the human drama on those beaches. It was so shocking to see the level of trauma, especially among children, the innocents caught up in war,” she said. “There were thousands of items of clothing discarded by refugees. I was struck by the concept of the empty garment, evoking the hidden presence of the person who had worn that item. These clothes reveal what is now being forgotten.” Two years ago, the image of the body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy, on a beach in Turkey focused global opinion on the plight of refugees. Now, said Dorman, “there is a deepening and worsening crisis but it no longer occupies news headlines. People find it easy to turn away and forget – partly because they feel so helpless.” Suspended aims to bring the refugee crisis back into focus, particularly around Christmas, and to raise funds for the Starfish Foundation, a charity helping refugees. “Christmas can very easily be bankrupt of meaning,” said the Rev Lucy Winkett, the rector of St James’s. “So as a church we’re saying there’s no better time to talk about this big issue. “Christmas is a story of a child born into danger, it’s a story of perilous journeys, fleeing persecution and violence, rootlessness. So when you see the children’s clothes, baby clothes [in the installation], the link with the Christmas story is absolutely undeniable.” The Labour peer Alf Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, said it was impossible not to be moved by Suspended. “Every one of these items of clothing represents a life, it’s very poignant.” He called on the government to honour its commitment under the Dubs amendment to provide safe passage to the UK for 480 unaccompanied minors living in refugee camps. To date, 202 children have been brought to the UK, including two from Greece this week. “It’s critical that we hold the government to account and ensure that we don’t close the door now to children seeking sanctuary in our country,” Lord Dubs said. “Every child that comes is a victory – it gives that child the chance of a decent life.” Brexit had “set the clock back”, he added. “It’s taken all the headlines and most of the energy of government ministers. The public has a short memory. So it’s really important that faith organisations have been so solid on this issue.” Dorman said she had been “ruminating on this project for two years – it’s been a slow burn”. She shipped 1,400 items of clothing in 27 boxes from Lesbos, and then selected those she felt told the most moving stories. All had to be dry-cleaned and made fire-retardent. “I’ve tried to convey the chaos, the explosion of people’s lives. It’s about the fragility and vulnerability of human beings,” she said. In 2015, St James’s hosted an earlier art installation by Dorman, Flight, which featured a refugee boat salvaged from Greece and hung in the church’s nave. “It’s not the church’s job to write immigration policy, but it is our job to speak up for people who are suffering,” said Winkett. “So I don’t mind at all being political with a small p. We’re saying the government should take the Dubs children.” Suspended will be on display until 8 February."
2017-08-20T19:01:12Z,Solidarity must extend far beyond the victims of terror | Editorial,"Spain has been a model of solidarity in the three days since the terror attacks that killed 14 people in Barcelona and Cabrils. That number is now known to include the seven-year-old Julian Cadman, who had dual British-Australian nationality and whose engaging image has been on front pages. He had been missing since the savage vehicle attack on Thursday afternoon. On Sunday morning the king and queen led the mourners at a service in La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona’s basilica, which, perhaps paradoxically in the circumstances, was conceived by Antoni Gaudí as a paeon to faith and nationalism. More than 1,500 people packed the church, while nearby Las Ramblas continued to be a focus for grief and resistance. But behind the solidarity, Spain’s national cohesion faces more stresses than in most European countries. At least eight of the terrorists appear to have grown up in one small town, Ripoll. Their horrified families are blaming Abdelbaki Es Satty, the imam of one of the town’s mosques, for radicalising their sons. The small community, where one in 10 residents is a migrant, is in a state of shock to discover that football-loving kids who appeared entirely comfortable with their Spanish identity set out on such a murderous course. Police, who are investigating what they now say was a plot to launch a huge terror attack, are trying to establish whether the imam died in a gas explosion that destroyed a house last Wednesday. Yet this is a region that is uncomfortably familiar with conflicts of identity. Catalonia’s president, Carles Puigdemont, attended the Sunday service with the king and queen, but it was a rare joint appearance with the monarchs for the republican politician, who is the architect of the unofficial referendum on independence that is scheduled to take place in less than six weeks’ time. Madrid continues to insist the plebiscite is illegal and that it will do everything it can to stop it happening. The last Catalan president who organised a similar referendum has been banned from public office for two years. Thursday’s attack is likely to be used by Madrid to add to the pressure on the regional government. The argument has already been rehearsed in the national capital’s newspaper El País, which said it was a wake-up call for the Catalan government, described independence as a fantasy and called on the regional politicians to “ditch the democratic nonsense … and start working for our real interests”. There are plenty of people, not just in the darker corners of social media, who believe there is a link between terror and refugees. Late last year, Europol reported Islamic State was deliberately trying to radicalise vulnerable refugees in order to inflame the migration crisis and turn EU citizens against refugees seeking asylum. That makes the challenge Barcelona faces now, to sustain the qualities of a multicultural cosmopolitanism, the youthful and open approach that has made it so beloved, the more important. It has a fine record: its recent hostility to rapidly growing tourism, partly aggravated by the way Airbnb has driven up rents in the city, is more than matched – as banners during anti-tourism protests showed – by its readiness to welcome refugees. It describes itself as a “refugee city” and it has an impressive plan for comprehensive reception and resettlement facilities. But Barcelona’s offer of welcome is not shared absolutely everywhere in Spain, and, last week, the UN refugee agency warned the country was struggling to cope with the 9,300 refugees who have already arrived this year. That number will only increase as the route from Libya becomes ever more dangerous and some of the tens of thousands who risk the crossing to Italy seek a safer route. The past year has seen terror strike half a dozen European countries. Events in Spain were still unfolding when a man went on the rampage in the Finnish town of Turku, murdering two women. His ethnicity, like that of the Spanish terrorists, was Moroccan. These brutal murders have played a part in poisoning the atmosphere against migrants. While Angela Merkel of Germany stoutly upholds her commitment to refugees, the EU collectively has failed at every turn, unable even to ensure that members honour the commitments they have already made to ease the burden on the frontline states of Greece and Italy. This is a desperate tragedy for millions fleeing endemic violence and insecurity. It threatens, too, the precious cohesion of neighbourhoods. And it is a kind of victory for the terrorists of all sides who seek to undermine Europe’s universal values. • This article was amended on 22 August 2017. An earlier version said La Sagrada Familia was a cathedral. This has been corrected to basilica."
2017-08-30T22:02:17Z,"Australia has 'golden opportunity' to help shape world refugee debate, says report","Australia has a “golden opportunity” to help shape worldwide refugee protection for the 21st century, and to “pre-empt future shocks” of forced migration in the region, a new Lowy Institute paper argues. The Asia-Pacific faces the possibility of massive forced migration, caused by conflict, climate change, or political upheaval, and it is in Australia’s national interests to contribute to and shape the emerging international compact on refugees, report author and Lowy fellow Dr Khalid Koser told the Guardian in Sydney. “Australia is the key rich country in this part of the world, it’s one of the few parties to the refugees convention, but it should not be complacent.” Acknowledging the ongoing controversies surrounding Australia’s hardline policies on boat-borne arrivals – in particular forcible boat turn-backs and indefinite offshore detention – Koser said current planning needed to consider migration flows over coming decades. “At the moment things are good in Australia, there are certainly issues, but you’ve turned back the boats, you’ve got management of migration, you’ve got management of resettlement. However, if there are large environmental issues, if there’s a war in Papua New Guinea, if Isis takes root in in the Philippines, there could suddenly be large numbers of people trying to come to Australia, and it should be in your interest to make sure that the international refugee regime responds more effectively.” Signs of future mass migrations are present already: the violent government oppression of the Rohingya ethnic minority in Myanmar’s Rakhine state has sent tens of thousands fleeing over that country’s borders; Isis-inspired fighters have defied Philippine government forces on the island of Mindanao for more than three months; and an Australian Senate inquiry has heard from defence chiefs that climate change-induced migration is one of the greatest security threats the country faces this century. In September last year, all 193 members states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the New York Declaration, which committed countries to drafting two new “global compacts” to improve and strengthen international protection regimes for refugees and for migrants, and to more equally share responsibility for their protection. The compacts are set to be presented to UN general assembly next year. Critics have argued the compacts may end up a series of bland, unenforceable principles, but supporters say the new documents are a chance to reform and strengthen a global refugee regime that is failing to match demand for protection. “The current system is just not working,” Koser said. “Half the world’s refugees are just stuck in protracted situations, with no solutions. That can’t be the right solution. The compacts could be an opportunity for some out-of-the-box thinking and to test these more difficult issues.” Koser said he didn’t believe the refugee compact would be “transformative”, but told The Guardian there was an “unusual momentum” across governments, the private sector, and civil society, towards finding new solutions. The 1951 Refugees Convention was written in the aftermath of World War II to address the massive displacement caused by that conflict. It has attracted significant criticism for being unwieldy and ill-suited to modern displacement, but there are few proponents to abandon it, for fear whatever might replace it would be weaker, not stronger. There are currently more people forcibly displaced from their homes than at almost any time in history – more than 65 million, according to the latest UNHCR figures. In discussion over a new global refugee compact, Australia could offer technical and financial advice to new resettlement countries, help create new pathways for refugees (such as community or private sponsorship), or help regional neighbours provide humanitarian assistance, the Lowy paper says. Koser says Australia’s international reputation had been severely damaged by its adoption of hardline policies for boat-borne arrivals (while remaining a strong formal resettlement country), but the “stigma” around boat turnbacks and offshore detention had faded globally. “There was a very strong stigma when this stuff started happening, the international community was aghast, that this good international citizen was doing something so obviously deplorable, was doing something so obviously trespassing on rights and legality.” He said Australia’s hardline practices had become “normalised” in international opinion, or even, as countries faced growing migration flows, regarded with a “tacit approval”. “Australia’s achieved what lots of countries would love to achieve. Europe would love to stop Syrians coming, cynically because they’re not wanted, more generously, because we don’t want them drowning in the Mediterranean, these are the arguments your government uses as well. You’ve managed to do it, we never could, for reasons of geography. You haven’t got the worst civil war in 50 years on your doorstep.” The scale of Australia’s irregular migration, even at its height, was a fraction of that being experienced by Europe. Koser said the Australian model of dealing could not be exported elsewhere. “I don’t think it can happen. There are legal, geographical, and historical specificities about Australia that means it might work. But success is very very subjective. I wouldn’t say that operation Sovereign Borders has been a success in many ways. It stopped the boats, and not much more.” “I think it’s a model that’s specific to this country.” Koser said much of the world’s global refugee debate was hampered by the political reality of “governments trapped in short-term democratic cycles” “Your job is to get re-elected next year. I can’t convince you to wait for 20 years to get success, because you need to convince your electorate and convince your media by next year.” He argued drafting a new global refugee compact could be “the opportunity to do some longer-term thinking”. “Yes, there’s a current crisis that needs fixing, though I would put ‘crisis’ in inverted commas, but let’s also begin to think about what our systems need to look like in the future. And that’s about the challenges of climate change, the challenges of internal displacement … the challenges of endemic crises in places like sub-Saharan Africa.”"
2017-12-09T08:00:01Z,Perfect match: website gives academic refugees chance to connect,"When a record number of asylum seekers and refugees arrived in Germany two years ago, Carmen Bachmann was one of many in the country who felt compelled to help the newcomers settle in. She did not rush down to greet them with welcome signs or pledge to volunteer at refugee camps. Instead Bachmann, 41, a Leipzig University professor, turned into something of a matchmaker. She created a website, Chance for Science, to connect refugee academics with German counterparts across a broad range of disciplines. The site uses the template of a dating service and allows users to register as a refugee academic or a German professor or researcher, stating their location and field of study, so people can be matched together with others doing similar work. There are now 720 registered users, including 224 refugees. The links made via the website could lead to a job, although Bachmann said that was not the main aim. “The primary thinking is to encourage work collaboration, the sharing of ideas or to help refugee scientists gain access to the latest research. Alongside it, we have also been running educational workshops for the past year with government funding. They help newcomers understand how the German academic system works,” she said. “We also want to make people feel like they are staying in touch with the academic world. Being an academic is part of their identity and when refugees come here they lose that. It is important for them to be in an environment where they can be a specialist again and people recognise them as such. People can come together and share ideas, discuss and create networks.” As a result of the project, Bachmann is now working with Günay Karli, 45, a computer scientist who specialises in artificial intelligence. He worked at Fatih University in Turkey before it was one of several institutions closed down by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, over alleged links to the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen and an attempted political coup. Karli, who arrived in Germany from Bosnia three months ago, said: “I was surprised to hear about the project because it is so selfless … This project is important for refugees because we do not have anything related to our academic fields or system. We don’t know anyone who knows how things work and we have a desire to continue our research, learn and to share ideas.” Bachmann and Karli are working together on taxation. One aspect they are looking at is whether it is possible to predict the future performance of a company and its key performance indicator (KPI) by analysing social media. Karli is helping with data analysis and using computer software. While Karli waits to hear the result of his asylum application, he is happy to continue doing academic work. Although he cannot take paid employment, everything he does will be useful for his portfolio of work. “I am a refugee but this is only a small part of who I am. I am also still an academic,” he said. “No matter what situation I find myself in I have to continue with my research still. We cannot stop our brains from working.” Bachmann and her small team recently held a conference, Academics on the Flight, where eight refugees spoke on stage about their work and others presented posters. “Lots of the refugees have no affiliations any more and Chance for Science is an intermediate affiliation, so people feel they can belong to something, even if their home university does not exist any more,” she said. Bachmann got a year’s worth of money from the government to run the workshops and conference but it runs out in December. “I would like more funding as it has become a second full-time job for me … I need support because there is lots of potential in this idea and it is growing fast. It could also work for other professions.” She said the biggest challenge of the project had been overcoming the bureaucracy of the German system. “I did not ask permission from anyone to set up the website, just the president of the university, because it would have taken too long to do it officially. These are people who would have nothing to do and I wanted to start it quickly.” Her inspiration came from a chance meeting with an academic at a refugee camp. “I met a man and all he had with him was his diploma. He was so happy someone was paying attention to it because, understandably, the volunteers there were just making sure everyone had shelter and food. “From that moment it became very personal for me and it helped me realise what being an academic is. I have learned just as much from this process as those I have been helping.”"
2017-12-13T15:41:58Z,Artist hangs refugees' clothing in London church to highlight crisis,"A baby’s bright red bib emblazoned with the words “My 1st Christmas Ever!” Pyjama tops with sleeve ends intertwined like holding hands. A pair of jeans upside down as though their owner is falling from a height. Shoes, socks, mittens, hats. A long, winding, blue patterned scarf. These are among 700 items of refugees’ clothing salvaged from beaches and olive groves on the Greek island of Lesbos and hung in an installation by the British war artist Arabella Dorman in the nave of St James’s church in Piccadilly, London. Dorman has called her artwork Suspended, reflecting both the powerful and poignant display of clothing and the state of limbo experienced by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and misery. Dorman first visited Lesbos in 2015, after earlier spending time on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. “But nothing compared me for the human drama on those beaches. It was so shocking to see the level of trauma, especially among children, the innocents caught up in war,” she said. “There were thousands of items of clothing discarded by refugees. I was struck by the concept of the empty garment, evoking the hidden presence of the person who had worn that item. These clothes reveal what is now being forgotten.” Two years ago, the image of the body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy, on a beach in Turkey focused global opinion on the plight of refugees. Now, said Dorman, “there is a deepening and worsening crisis but it no longer occupies news headlines. People find it easy to turn away and forget – partly because they feel so helpless.” Suspended aims to bring the refugee crisis back into focus, particularly around Christmas, and to raise funds for the Starfish Foundation, a charity helping refugees. “Christmas can very easily be bankrupt of meaning,” said the Rev Lucy Winkett, the rector of St James’s. “So as a church we’re saying there’s no better time to talk about this big issue. “Christmas is a story of a child born into danger, it’s a story of perilous journeys, fleeing persecution and violence, rootlessness. So when you see the children’s clothes, baby clothes [in the installation], the link with the Christmas story is absolutely undeniable.” The Labour peer Alf Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, said it was impossible not to be moved by Suspended. “Every one of these items of clothing represents a life, it’s very poignant.” He called on the government to honour its commitment under the Dubs amendment to provide safe passage to the UK for 480 unaccompanied minors living in refugee camps. To date, 202 children have been brought to the UK, including two from Greece this week. “It’s critical that we hold the government to account and ensure that we don’t close the door now to children seeking sanctuary in our country,” Lord Dubs said. “Every child that comes is a victory – it gives that child the chance of a decent life.” Brexit had “set the clock back”, he added. “It’s taken all the headlines and most of the energy of government ministers. The public has a short memory. So it’s really important that faith organisations have been so solid on this issue.” Dorman said she had been “ruminating on this project for two years – it’s been a slow burn”. She shipped 1,400 items of clothing in 27 boxes from Lesbos, and then selected those she felt told the most moving stories. All had to be dry-cleaned and made fire-retardent. “I’ve tried to convey the chaos, the explosion of people’s lives. It’s about the fragility and vulnerability of human beings,” she said. In 2015, St James’s hosted an earlier art installation by Dorman, Flight, which featured a refugee boat salvaged from Greece and hung in the church’s nave. “It’s not the church’s job to write immigration policy, but it is our job to speak up for people who are suffering,” said Winkett. “So I don’t mind at all being political with a small p. We’re saying the government should take the Dubs children.” Suspended will be on display until 8 February."
2017-11-10T08:43:00Z,Tony Abbott fundraiser surrounded by pro-refugee protesters,"Hundreds of pro-refugee protesters have surrounded a fundraising event for former prime minister Tony Abbott in Sydney and heckled attendees. A vocal crowd of about 200 wrestled with police as they attempted block cars with guests entering the event in Redfern. They confronted guests, including Abbott’s sister Christine Forster. She was forced back from the entrance to the event before police formed a ring around her and pushed their way through the crowd. Protesters shouted “Refugees are welcome here” and “Shame on you” to event attendees as bands played in the background. The protest is being held to oppose Australia’s offshore detention system, with immigration minister Peter Dutton attending the fundraiser. In Melbourne on Friday evening, more than 1,000 protesters supporting the plight of refugees on Manus Island brought the CBD to a standstill. The demonstration, which set off from the State Library, caused major delays for trams and cars as protesters move through the city down Swanston Street. Dozens of police, including some on horseback, lined the street to prevent the rally from heading towards the city’s busiest intersection outside Flinders Street station. Police earlier said they were aware of the planned action, adding they respected the rights of protesters but “will not tolerate people breaking the law or endangering the safety of the community”. On Friday, Papua New Guinean immigration officials and police started destroying makeshift shelters built by about 600 refugees and asylum seekers who refuse to relocate from the now closed Manus Island detention centre. They also destroyed the rubbish bins that were used to store water. The initial efforts to dismantle the camp started on Friday, a day before a slated deadline for forcible removal that Prime Minister Peter O’Neill warned of on Thursday. Almost 60 refugees and asylum seekers had already voluntarily boarded buses and trucks to be taken to new accommodation on Friday as a result of the operation, said Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas."
2017-10-02T07:25:36Z,"'Young migrants in Ireland are treated as children, not asylum seekers'","When the first group of unaccompanied child migrants arrived in Ireland from the Calais refugee camp earlier this year, their progress through Dublin airport was impeded by well-wishers who wanted the youngsters to know they were welcome. “I vividly remember not one but two elderly Irish gentlemen, 10 minutes apart, who each insisted we tell the kids they were really glad they were here,” says Thomas Dunning, principal social worker with the team for separated children seeking asylum at Tusla, Ireland’s child and family agency. “That reflects the marked change in feeling we’ve seen in the past 12 months.” Last November, the Irish parliament responded to public clamour by making an all-party commitment to accept up to 200 children who’d been living in the (by-then dismantled) Calais camp. Extra resources were promised for Tusla, which oversees a well-established programme for child migrants that is regarded as a model of good practice around the world. In late October, the Irish programme will be one of the approaches discussed at a conference in Stockholm, organised by the European Social Network, on meeting the needs of migrant children and young people. Sweden has been dealing with some of the largest numbers of child refugees, receiving more than 35,000 in 2015 alone. “Our numbers are small by comparison – we had 126 last year,” says Dunning. “But we are proud of what we do and we have a ‘child first’ ethos – they are treated as a child, not an asylum seeker – and an equity of care principle that’s almost unique in Europe.” This principle guarantees that child migrants are given the same level of care and support as Irish children in the care system. It was introduced in 2009 after providers had been overwhelmed by the numbers of unaccompanied young people arriving in the early years of the decade – a peak of 1,085 in 2001 – and resorted to accommodating them in dormitory-style hostels. The last hostel was shut in 2010 and migrant children are now placed in foster care or small children’s homes, each accommodating no more than six. The child will enter the asylum process “if and when appropriate”, sponsored by the social worker assigned to them on arrival in loco parentis. The social worker accompanies them through the process even if they turn 18 and legally become an adult. The number of child migrants arriving in Ireland is growing again, including those being admitted from shelters in Greece via the European resettlement scheme. The UK has reportedly taken none from Greece this year, citing procedural difficulties. Dunning, himself a migrant from the US, is confident that Ireland can deal with the rising numbers. “I feel we are ready for it,” he says. “I can go and say, ‘I need this Irish child to get that, and this child from Ghana needs to have it too’. I am listened to and the resources are put in place.” Dunning’s team of 17 at Tusla is complemented by a separate, 11-strong children’s service at the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (ETB), which is led by manager Jessica Farnan, who will be speaking at the Stockholm conference. On arrival, children go straight into a programme designed to prepare them for mainstream schooling. The programme was first envisaged to last six weeks, but low education levels among the current wave of young migrants – and typically limited English – means they usually need longer preparation, sometimes a year or more. “In some cases they have little by way of reading or writing skills in their own language and we are really starting from scratch,” says Farnan. “It can be a case of ‘learning to learn’. Those who have been in Calais may have to learn how to go to school and how to get up in the morning.” Most arrivals from France are boys, originally from Afghanistan or Somalia. Their needs may be quite different to those coming from Syria via Greece, says Farnan. “The ETB first researched the needs of unaccompanied minors 15 or so years ago, but we have changed what we do as the system has changed. We carry on doing that.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox. Follow us on Twitter (@GdnSocialCare) and like us on Facebook.

2017-12-04T07:14:55Z,Government loses vote on New Zealand refugee offer – as it happened,"And on that note, we shall call it a night. The government was able to have that vote again, because of a procedure called a recommittal, which basically means Christopher Pyne argued that the vote didn’t properly reflect the chamber’s will. Once the apologies occurred, the chamber had the vote to have the vote and by that time the government had the numbers and then won the vote. And it was the Greens motion, which Labor supported (it was moved by Adam Bandt) I’ve been informed it is actually about the fifth time the government has lost a vote in the House of Representatives. No wonder Malcolm Turnbull didn’t look happy. The marriage equality debate will continue tonight before being picked up again tomorrow. At this stage, the house will run out of time to vote on it by the end of the sitting week, if all the speakers stay on the list and then the amendments are dealt with. We shall see. Milo Yiannopoulos will speak to any interested MPs and staff in one of the parliament function/dining rooms tomorrow, at the invitation of David Leyonhjelm. Yay. We should get to banning foreign donations sometime in the near future. As soon as the government finishes dealing with bills it makes a priority, in this case, the superannuation changes, and then filibusters on and then pulls from the priority list when the crossbench support seemingly dissipates, in the Senate. And we have more citizenship saga to look forward to. How members will be referred is still being worked out but the government is not ruling out using its numbers (plus a crossbencher) to force opposition referrals. That has some way to play out. Oh, and be prepared to never want to hear the word “Bennelong” again. Because the government is going to use every opportunity it has (read: dixer) to talk about that byelection. (And for those wondering, there is still no official Queensland election result. This is going to take some time, as the Election Commission Queensland are now making their way through postal votes) But in the meantime, congratulations on making it through Monday! And for helping me through it! For those asking, it doesn’t look as though Barnaby Joyce will be back in the parliament anytime before at least Thursday, which means the government is going to be short on the numbers for a few days more. That makes Bob Katter’s vote with the government pretty important today. Make sure you watch for that. The biggest of thank yous to Mike Bowers and please make sure you check out his Twitter and Instagram for more of today’s insanity. As always, thank you to the Guardian Australia brains trust for all their help and typo catching (which are always just mine) and again to you, for reading, tweeting, and playing along. Even those of you who seemed a bit cranky today. We have three (scheduled) days left and I promise you we will get through them. I’ll see you back here just after 8am tomorrow for more fun and games. Have a wonderful night. The unavoidably detained Steve Ciobo We have had the final divide and the motion was voted down, 74-73. It is at this point that Labor would like to remind you that Anthony Albanese didn’t lose a vote in the three years he oversaw a (minority) government’s business. This is either the third or fourth time this has happened to this government. Which includes one in the first week of the 45th parliament. A nice bookend then. See what I mean about the mood? That feeling when you lose a vote the first day back after suspending parliament the week before. (That’s Bob Katter siding with the government there.) So much being said in one photo: Tony Smith wants the two who missed the vote to explain why they missed the vote. Steve Ciobo apologises for missing it. “I was unfortunately detained and not able to get here on time,” he says. If I had known that was all you had to say, my teen years would have been a lot easier. Warren Entsch also apologises and says it was “members’ misadventure”. Smith says they have confirmed they did not deliberately miss the vote and calls the divide again. From my perusal of that list, Steve Ciobo looks like he was the other missing MP. Actually, we must have had two missing persons. I’m guessing Warren Entsch may have been one, as he was on Sky. Working on finding out who the second one was. Back in the House, the chamber just had a division to agree with a Senate resolution to accept the New Zealand offer to settle refugees in Australia’s offshore detention centres. It was won 73 to 72. Christopher Pyne is calling for the House to divide again, which is just code for someone missed the division. So the government lost the vote. But is calling for another one. Speaking to David Speers on Sky, Warren Entsch is making the argument to keep any amendments to the marriage equality legislation separate from the legislation itself. He says the inquiry the government has set up (led by Philip Ruddock) is the place for anything else to be considered but he also believes that as time moves on “a lot of the fear will dissipate”. The Greens have put forward a motion condemning “the offensive behaviour of alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as any senator who seeks to use parliament to provide a platform for the hate, abuse or harassment of women, Jews and members of the LGBTIQ and multicultural communities.” From Richard Di Natale’s statement: The Senate today condemned the despicable behaviour of Milo Yiannopoulos and any senator, like Senator David Leyonhjelm, who seeks to use the Australian parliament to provide a platform for people who preach hate and incite abuse and harassment of minority groups. Milo Yiannopoulos is a white supremacist, a paedophilia apologist and a shameless self-promoter completely lacking in moral character. He aims to lower our political discourse into the sewer and turn neighbour against neighbour for the sake of his own bank account. It is a disgrace that Senator David Leyonhjelm is bringing him to our parliament. Our parliament should be a place that celebrates the diversity of our community, not one where peddlers of hate are given a platform to preach their abuse. Unfortunately the parliament’s presiding officers declined the Greens’ call to revoke his permission to speak here, which would have been the appropriate action. But we do commend the ALP and the Senate crossbench for standing with us and refusing to let hate go unchecked. At this stage, it doesn’t look like we will have an answer on citizenship referrals or an end to the marriage equality legislation debate by the end of the week. This could change, and very quickly, but right now time is not on our side. As you can imagine, the mood is not overly festive in this place right now. That photo Labor used in question time has spilled over onto Twitter, with Labor and the Coalition playing a strange sort of pictionary game: As mentioned a little bit ago, the speakers list is now up to 102 people on the marriage equality bill. As Lane Sainty points out, this is going to have ramifications ... Over in the Senate ... The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked the attorney general, George Brandis, a series of questions a while ago about a vague donation to the NSW Liberal party from controversial Chinese billionaire businessman Huang Xiangmo. Di Natale: Malcolm Turnbull reportedly hinted at a probe into Labor senator Sam Dastyari’s dealing with businessman Huang Xiangmo, someone who intelligence experts believe was, until recently, part of a global campaign run by the Chinese Communist party to advance China’s interests overseas. Since 2012, Mr Huang has donated almost $3m to both sides of politics, but, importantly, on 27 September 2017, some two years after Asio had briefed both the Liberal and Labor parties about the threat of taking donations from Mr Huang, an amended return was lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission by the NSW Liberal party, which reveals a $44,000 payment from Mr Huang. Minister, what’s the purpose of this payment? And, given the prime minister’s concerns, will you now commit to repaying the money? Brandis responded: Well, Senator Di Natale. First of all. We don’t ever speculate upon investigations. That little opener led to guffaws from the opposition bench. The Senate president, Scott Ryan, had to bring the chamber to order. Brandis continued: Senator Di Natale, I have actually reviewed the transcript of the prime minister’s remarks this morning and, in my view, it is not a fair or indeed an available construction of anything he said to suggest that he hinted, even hinted, at the existence of an investigation. In addressing these matters, what I have said is that certain matters have been credibly alleged by reputable journalists against Senator Dastyari and that is undoubtedly true. But I will not comment on, nor will the prime minister or any minister, comment on, confirm, or for that matter deny, the existence of an investigation.” Di Natale then asked Brandis to return to the point of his question. Will the Liberal Party commit to repaying the $44,000 donation from Mr Huang? Brandis said: I don’t know the details of that donation but I can assure you that the Liberal party is compliant with all of its disclosure obligations under the commonwealth electoral act. All electoral parties receive donations from business people. My side of politics does, the Labor party does. The Greens do. And there is no prohibition on business people donating to political parties just because they are Chinese. Di Natale said he just wanted to know if the Liberal party would repay the $44,000 donation. Brandis replied: What is alleged against Senator Dastyari has nothing whatsoever to do with the disclosure of donations, it has to do with other matters, as you’re aware. George Christensen has weighed in on the penalty rate amendments Labor forced onto the Fair Work bill: Time for some Mike Bowers magic: Back in the Senate and George Brandis is now arguing to remove the superannuation bills as a priority. Labor had attempted to do that last week and failed. So, I guess we can take that as a given that the government no longer has the numbers for all the moving parts on those ones. Tanya Plibersek is up again with another question on the NBN: Last week, the NBN announced it was halting the HFC rollout of the second-rate NBN. Can the prime minister outline just how many millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money is being wasted by this latest failure? Malcolm Turnbull: I can tell the honourable member that there are billions and billions of dollars being saved by not doing the NBN in the way the Labor party had proposed to do and, of course, between such – $30bn in savings and six to eight years in terms of time to complete it. The reality is that the NBN is one of the fastest rollouts of a telecom network, ever. It is extraordinary. 40,000 premises being activated just about every week. Now, Mr Speaker, what we’ve seen, I gave some figures just a moment ago, is 6.5 million premises as of the last published data, are available to be connected right now. So that’s so people can sign up and get hooked up now, and there’s three and a quarter million paying customers right now. Of course, like any big rollout like that, it has challenges in some areas. What the NBN is doing, is ensuring with respect to HFC, it’s making sure the technology works well. It is a complex business rolling out this network, they’re doing an outstanding job and making sure they put the customer experience first.” And after working himself up in to a lather, he puts further questions on notice and question time is over. While that Dixer is going on and my will to live is dripping out of my fingers, an update on the speaking list for the marriage equality legislation. There are now 102 speakers listed. Out of an eligible 147. Labor – 57/69 MPs (50 to go) Coalition – 41 out of 73 (34 to go) Crossbench – 4/5 (Katter is not on the list) We now have a total of 102 speakers listed (out of a potential pool of 147 – minus Speaker, Alexander and Barnaby) ALP 57/69 (with 50 still to go) Govt 41/73 with 34 still to go Cross 4/5 (No Katter) So 88 to go. So far, the average speaking time has been just under 15 minutes. A Dixer for Scott Morrison on what the government is doing in regards of tax cuts, including for the people of Bennelong. Sigh. Tanya Plibersek has another question on the NBN HFC delay: “Can the prime minister confirm he first became aware of the problems back in 2015 and did he take any actions?” He is taking it on notice. Another Dixer, now on Medicare, from Greg Hunt. Who makes it a whole minute before mentioning Bennelong and Kristina Keneally. My liver is lucky this is not a drinking game. Another Dixer aimed at attacking Kristina Keneally. Anyone would think the battle for Bennelong is bothering the government. Bill Shorten also wants to talk about Bennelong and what is happening with the NBN there. The prime minister and John Alexander promised voters in Bennelong before the last election that they’d all have NBN now. But last week NBN announced it will delay the rollout to 40,000 premises. Why do those 40,000 premises now have to wait even later. If John Alexander couldn’t even deliver on his last promise, why should the voters in Bennelong believe him now? Malcolm Turnbull (after attacking Keneally’s infrastructure record while premier). Out of the, I think, 3.3 million customers that have got the NBN now activated, there’s well over 6 million premises that have got it available. It’s on track to be available to around three-quarters of Australian households this coming year, Mr Speaker, and the company has said it’s on track to be completed in accordance with their schedule by 2020. So the project is under way. The rollout on the hybrid fibre coaxial network has experienced some technical difficulties and what they’ve done is they’ve delayed it ... delayed it or paused it so as to get those difficulties sorted out. Peter Dutton takes a Dixer designed to attack Kristina Keneally. Who, last time I checked, was not in parliament. Then we move on to Mark Dreyfus who asks: My question is to the prime minister. I refer to Labor introducing a bill to parliament to ban foreign political donations over a year ago and I also refer to reports in the Daily Telegraph that Mr Huang’s right-hand man is campaigning for Liberal candidate and former MP John Alexander in Bennelong. What else have Mr Huang and his associates given to the Liberals to help keep the prime minister in his job and is this one of the reasons why the prime minister has delayed banning political foreign donations for over a year? Speaker Tony Smith only rules the part of the question dealing with policy (foreign donations) in order. “The foreign donations legislation will be introduced into the House this week,” the PM says. Malcolm Turnbull then starts talking about Sam Dastyari and Tony Burke points out part of the question was ruled out of order and the prime minister can’t address it. So, we move on. Christopher Pyne gets a Dixer designed to let the government talk more on Sam Dastyari. We move on to Tony Burke who asks about where the information regarding Dastyari came from, without actually mentioning Dastyari: On Wednesday and Thursday Fairfax reported two stories on national security. The attorney general even confirmed that national security information should never find its way into the hands into the media but it has. Has the government ordered any investigation into what the attorney general has admitted a leak of national security information and who had possession of that information among ministers and their staff? Malcolm Turnbull: The honourable member omitted one important fact which was the information he is describing as having been referred to in the Fairfax press apparently, it was something on Wednesday and Thursday. Now, is he talking about Senator Dastyari ... is that right? No, OK, very, good. He’s referred to Senator Dastyari’s, he’s referred to Senator Dastyari and the – my observation is very simply this, that leaks of national security information should never occur, full stop. Now, if the honourable member is alleging that a security agency was responsible for putting information into the press, then he should make that allegation. Burke interrupts to say that Turnbull is answering a question that wasn’t asked. The Speaker allows it and Turnbull finishes: If the honourable member wants to ask me a question about information published in the Fairfax press, or anywhere else, then he should actually spell out what this information is,because he has, in some rather coy way, failed to actually describe it, which makes me think it might have something to do with a certain senator. The senator whose name, apparently, cannot be mentioned by the Labor party. Let me say this to the honourable member – if you’re not prepared to name him, you shouldn’t be prepared to keep him in the Senate. Again, Labor can’t sack Dastyari from the Senate, only disendorse him. Also, how many questions on national security information appearing in the media does the prime minister take that he needs names to be able to answer ... oh, that’s right. Politics. Rebekha Sharkie has the independents’ question and wants to know when the government will action the findings of the royal commission, which included the Don Dale investigation: Malcolm Turnbull: My government will now consider the recommendations made in the report and with the Northern Territory government, in respect of whose activities most of the recommendations apply to, key stakeholders and communities, to form the development of our response. Now, most of the recommendations, as I noted, are matters for the Northern Territory government. The Australian government will now also carefully consider the findings that are directed to the commonwealth. We have already committed to ratifying the optional protocol to the convention against torture will ensure that oversight of places of detention, including youth detention, is strengthened in the Northern Territory and of course everywhere else. Mr Speaker, when children are safe, the whole community benefits as well. This is our greatest obligation, to look after our children, we understand that. All children deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, all children deserve to be safe and that’s the responsibility of the whole community and, importantly, of course, families and government agencies. Now, I want to make a note I observe to the honourable member’s benefit, an observation about funding. I quote from the royal commission here. The commissioners wrote: ‘A consistent theme heard by the commission was that there is insufficient funding in the Northern Territory to address the issues it’s grappling with. However, having reviewed financial data available to the commission, the commission considers it is underlying problem is not the level of overall funding but that commonwealth and Northern Territory government investment is not rigorously tracked, monitored or evaluated to ensure that it’s appropriately distributed and directed. Value for the money expended cannot be demonstrated. The major investment in Aboriginal affairs over many years has delivered mixed success, often with dismally poor returns. A combination of underperforming programs, poor coordination across governments and a lack of engagement with Aboriginal people in the design and delivery of services is producing continually poor results. The approach must be changed.’ Now, we absolutely recognise the force of that observation. As you know in 2017-2018, the Northern Territory government will receive $4.2bn from the commonwealth. We are determined to ensure that every dollar that we spend on Indigenous affairs [and] Indigenous welfare delivers the outcome [we need]. So I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a very important question. Back in the House and it is a Dixer. Scott Morrison tries to appear enthused. Then on to Chris Bowen. He wants to know about Phil Coorey’s report in the Fin about the banks expecting the royal commission, and that the terms were “worked out” a long time ago because “it was inevitable”. “So why was the treasurer kept in the dark for so long?” Morrison: The terms of reference for the inquiry and the announcement of the royal commission into the banking sector was made at nine, Mr Speaker, on that day and that was the first that the banks and others were aware that this government was going to put a royal commission in place. There is no doubt, Mr Speaker, that the government over a period of time had been aware of the various arguments that had been put in place. Indeed, the arguments being put by the opposition over two-and-a-half years, which I note over all that period of time they called for a royal commission for the banks they never came up with the terms of reference, not once, Mr Speaker. Not once, not once did they come up with the terms of reference yet they were the ones that wanted to announce a royal commission into the banks, Mr Speaker. So, to my knowledge, and the minister for revenue’s and the prime minister’s acknowledge, that Treasury has been working into the terms of reference but at the end of the day the decision to go forward with a banking royal commission was made. But the recklessness of the leader of the opposition and the shadow treasurer for over two years calling into question the security of the financial sector, on which the entire economy depends. It was the point of their recklessness that required to government to take control over the situation and that’s what we have did. They have demonstrated a reckless behaviour towards the economy. If they put ever got to put that into office, it would be a shocker. Over in the Senate, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, is asking George Brandis about a $44,000 donation the Liberal party received from Huang Xiangmo sometime in the 2015-16 election year, which doesn’t appear to have been declared until recently: Di Natale: “Question is to the leader of the government representing the prime minister: 1. On 27 September 2017, some two years after Asio had briefed Liberal and Labor parties about the threat of taking donations from Mr Huang for being closely linked to the Chinese government, an amended political party disclosure return was lodged with the AEC by the NSW Liberal party. Because our donations laws encourage secrecy, the public don’t know what the $44,000 provided by Mr Huang’s Yuhu Group and Mandarin International Investment was for. It is simply listed as ‘other receipt’. What was the purpose of this payment? A few tables at Liberal fundraising dinners? Free rent? Please inform the Senate of its precise purpose. 2. Can the government assure the Australian people that no foreign donations, ‘other receipts’, or in-kind support such as Yuhu Group employee Tim Xu campaigning for Mr Alexander will have made their way into the Bennelong byelection campaign and that any such donation or payment will also be returned? 3. The government and opposition’s response to the Senator Dastyari and Mr Huang controversy has deftly sidestepped the deeper problem lying at the very heart of this scandal and our entire democracy – that political influence can be bought, especially without an ICAC. Whether they are foreign sourced, from corporations, unions or wealthy individuals – big donations create a sense of obligation or generosity to the donor. With this in mind, will the government examine strict caps for political donations across the board, no matter where it comes from? Amended donation declaration: http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/60/VQRP9A02.pdf Brandis says he doesn’t know the details of the donation. Tony Burke is next with a question for Malcolm Turnbull: I refer to the photograph of Mr Huang, which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 February 2016. Can the prime minister please identify the person on the right? Spoiler – it is the prime minister. I’m delighted to get that question. I really am. Because it shows the desperation of the Labor party. Their desperation, so desperately trying to spread, blow some smoke around and cover up the intimate relationship between Senator Dastyari and, so it would seem, the leader of the opposition. So they have a photograph with me at an event in a public street in Sydney. Hooray for that. What a revelation. If you had had a wider-angle lens, you could have got the other 5,000 people that were there as well. What we really need to know is this: What did the leader of the opposition say to Senator Dastyari directly or indirectly that prompted him, Senator Dastyari, to go to Mr Huang’s house, the house that the leader of the opposition had visited and knew well, to go to Mr Huang’s house and tell him how to avoid surveillance activities by Asio? The leader of the opposition has got to tell us that. He hasn’t. First Dixer. Just how amazing is this government (is the general gist) particularly when it comes to cost of living? Oh so very amazing, says the prime minister. Actually, the most amazing. Rinse and repeat. Question time! First up is Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: Can the prime minister confirm that since the House last sat five weeks ago, he has cancelled parliament, ruled out a banking royal commission, then announced a banking royal commission, halted the NBN rollout for 2 million households, had cabinet ministers calling for investigations into each other over cabinet leaks and been accused by his own backbenchers of a failure of leadership. When will the prime minister admit he has lost control of his government and lost authority as prime minister? Turnbull: The Labor party put in a strong showing comfortably ahead of the informal vote, just got into double figures. Barnaby Joyce’s swing was larger than the Labor party’s primary vote. It only happened on Saturday but I’m not surprised the leader of the opposition has blotted it out of his memory. One of the things that has occurred over the last five weeks that the leader of the opposition should not blot out of his memory is what advice he gave to Sam Dastyari. Before he met with Mr Huang. The leader of the opposition should not easily forget Mr Huang because he visited him at his house last year. He has a very good familiarity with the gentleman. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition remembers very well the function that he attended on 17 June with Senator Dastyari, with Mr Huang and then, shortly after that, Senator Dastyari had a press conference with Mr Huang. In the media briefing room at the commonwealth parliamentary office in Sydney. There are two lecterns there, two podiums. Each of them has the Australian coat of arms. Dastyari stood at one. Mr Huang stood at the other. Senator Dastyari stood at one and Mr Huang at the other. Senator Dastyari said these words, apparently written for him by someone else, “The South China Sea is China’s own affair”. This came after Mr Huang paid off debts for Senator Dastyari. It reads like talking points from the Global Times in Beijing. That’s what it was. Senator Dastyari contradicting Australian government policy, Labor party policy, on the South China Sea. He got sacked for that. But then, then, perhaps the leader of the opposition, as he trolls through the last five weeks, could remember what advice he gave Senator Dastyari that prompted him to tell Mr Huang how to avoid surveillance by Asio. The House is dealing with condolence motions. In the Senate, George Brandis said he had never heard of the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro (that broad church must be very broad indeed) until Friday and said his comments (you know, the ones where he said the prime minister needed to step down for the good of the nation) were the rants of “an obscure politician who no one outside of NSW has heard of”. Count down to question time is on. In the words of Taylor Swift, are you ready for it? Over in the Senate and the superannuation debate appears to be going well, if “by well” you mean the government appears to be filibustering its own bill. Labor has no further speakers but government senators have many, many things to say about super, which has some speculating it may have some problems with crossbench support for the part of the bill that seeks to change the governance structures of super boards. “Politically correct bigotry” is emerging as a late contender for this year’s T-shirt competition. Arthur Sinodinos has taken to Twitter to update his citizenship declaration with a document that was missing from his official citizenship declaration. The marriage equality legislation debate has been suspended (House timetables and all that) and the chamber has moved on to members’ statements, in the lead-up to question time. Cathy O’Toole is up first and she is congratulating Annastacia Palaszczuk on her election win (almost) with Labor inching towards 47 seats and a majority in the Queensland one-house parliament. The ECQ is still counting tens of thousands of postal votes, there are still preferences to be distributed (and those preferences have been all over the place, so it has made it very difficult to predict) and Labor won’t be declaring victory until the seats are declared by the commission. For those playing along at home, the LNP have still not conceded for the same reason. There has been a lot of interest in this election (especially from me, because it’s my old patch, but also because it has been fascinating) and you can watch the seat results here. Seats like Maiwar are particularly interesting – a handful of votes will decide them. The La Trobe MP Jason Wood says he used to “stand very proudly in firm opposition” to same-sex marriage, despite the protests outside his office, the angry emails and former colleagues in the police service criticising his decision. He said he then met some youth from his electorate, who told him about the rates of homosexual men taking their lives because of a lack of acceptance and a conversation with a friend in a same-sex relationship, who simply told him “I would love to get married”. “I love Anna and want to marry her,” his friend said when he asked why. He then began meeting same-sex couples and families in his electorate “and for the first time I started to see that my views on same-sex marriage were causing great sadness to others”. “I then realises it was time for me to seriously rethink this issue … following that, which I did, I decided to support same-sex marriage”. There will be cynicism to this view, I know. But I also think that it is a positive thing when our politicians make an effort to change their views. Anthony Albanese finishes his speech by mentioning something that has been left out a little in this debate, the idea that a child needs two parents to be part of a complete family. Albanese, raised by a single mother, said every time he heard that, “what I hear is intolerance, what I hear is that, somehow, some families are better than others”. “What matters in a family is love and care,” he says. “What matters in a family is love, it is is simple as that and no other family arrangement is better than another.” Anthony Albanese says he is “very proud” to support the legislation – but notes that the parliament is not leading but following in this instance. He is not supporting any of the amendments and says he has argued for it to be a conscience vote “but the fact is that people’s religious freedom will not be impacted by this legislation, just as the institution of marriage will not be undermined.” He also paid tribute to Paul O’Grady and those who marched in the first mardi gras, towards police, in 1978. You can follow along with the bill’s progression here Tony Abbott has moved amendments on the marriage equality bill. I would like this to be a unifying moment for our country. And the best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to acknowledge the continuing concerns that many decent Australians have about freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and parental rights. The best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to ensure that the anti-gay prejudice of the past is not replaced by s new politically correct bigotry. We certainly do not want new forms of division to replace old ones. I believe that the passage of the bill, as amended, will enable our country to go forward together, united in decency and in respect for the rights of all. Now, Mr Speaker, I certainly do not pretend to be an overnight convert to supporting same-sex marriage but I pledged to respect and facilitate the verdict of the Australian people. Same-sex marriage should now be recognised. It will now be recognised. There should be a clear distinction between how marriage is understood by the church and marriage as recognised by the state and, on that basis, I looking forward to attending the marriage of my sister, Christine, to her partner Virginia early in the new year. Katy Gallagher is not in parliament today – she’s with her child in hospital. She has put a statement out on Facebook in regards to her citizenship issue (she remained a dual citizen until a month after the election). Labor MP Warren Snowdon tells the chamber he is a Catholic but “this is a matter of equality, not faith”. He thanks Warren Entsch for the work he has done. There has been a lot of cross-party thanks given today. Malcolm Turnbull did not single out any opposition MPs. But he did take the time to say this: Previous governments have failed to take it on. The Labor party did nothing about it for six years in power. Now with a strong message from the Australian people which my government enabled, the way is clear. For those wondering, Bill Shorten did say a cross-chamber thank you Now this legislation will bear Senator [Dean] Smith’s signature and that is a worthy tribute to his patience and hard work down the years. And to his Liberal and conservative colleagues who stood up to be counted, you know who you are, you know what you did and what you have accomplished. Scott Morrison is speaking on the marriage equality bill now. He has a lot to say about the separation of church and state. You just can’t help but think that if parliament hadn’t been suspended last week, we would be voting on this now. And then Turnbull’s speech took a slightly strange turn: Codependency is a good thing ... and gay people are better off together then living alone comforted only by their respective cats. Last one, because it will probably be the last nice moment we have in this place this week. Prepare for the amendment debate. Here is why Malcolm Turnbull says he will be supporting amendments to the bill (which he admitted last week): There is nothing in the bill which prevents anyone from maintaining or adhering to the teaching of their church on marriage or morality. But we must not fail to recognise that there is sincere heartfelt anxiety about the bill’s impact on religious freedom. And that is why I will support amendments to the bill which will provide the additional reassurance and respect of these fundamental rights and freedoms. Turnbull has made a point of making this known: I am the first prime minister of Australia to be unequivocally and consistently in support of legalising same-sex marriage. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is speaking on the marriage equality bill. I am very firmly of the view that families are the foundation of our society and would be a stronger society if more people were married and by that I mean formally, legally married and fewer were divorced. If consulted by friends about marital dramas I always encouraged the singles to marry, the married to stick together and the neglectful to renew their commitment and the wronged to forgive. I am utterly unpersuaded by opposition [to marriage equality] that my marriage to Lucy or indeed any marriage is undermined by two gay men or women setting up house down the road whether it is called a marriage or not. Let’s be honest with each other, the threat to traditional marriage is not from gay people but a lack of loving commitment, whether found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery to name just a few manifestations of that loveless desert in which to many marriages come to grief. If the threat to marry today is lack of commitment, then surely other couples making and maintaining that commitment is as good example rather than a bad one. Speaking of citizenship, Katy Gallagher appears to have been a dual citizen until after the election. I doubt she is the only one who is going to be relying on the “reasonable steps” argument, as this train continues down the track. We go on to the Senate citizenship disclosures. Just back to the Senate and the penalty rates amendment, here is what Brendan O’Connor had to say in a statement: Labor’s amendment to reverse the cuts to penalty rates and protect penalty rates in the future has successfully passed the Senate this morning. Turnbull and his Liberals are so emphatically against penalty rates that they voted against their own bill – the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017 – after we forced the government to bring it on for debate. The government voted against protecting penalty rates, because they support wage cuts for 700,000 workers. One Nation voted against protecting penalty rates by voting with the government and against the bill at the third reading stage. Now the heat is on George Christensen to see whether or not he will cave into his Canberra masters or remain loyal to his commitment to his electorate to stop cuts to penalty rates. Turnbull and his Liberals have a callous disregard for Australian workers and this was on display in the Senate today. Just how out of touch can this government get? Under the Turnbull government we are headed to a low-wage, easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire society. Champagne all round The mea culpa continues There are at least 77 speakers on the marriage equality bill. But this is what everyone is talking about at the moment: For those wondering about the speakers, here is the list so far: The ACCC will start its inquiry into Facebook and Google. From its release: The ACCC’s inquiry will look at the effect that digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms are having on competition in media and advertising services markets. “The ACCC goes into this inquiry with an open mind to and will study how digital platforms such as Facebook and Google operate to fully understand their influence in Australia,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. “We will examine whether platforms are exercising market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of consumers, media content creators and advertisers. The ACCC will look closely at longer-term trends and the effect of technological change on competition in media and advertising. We will also consider the impact of information asymmetry between digital platform providers and advertisers and consumers. You’ll find more on that here The Nationals party room met this morning, where they celebrated Barnaby Joyce’s byelection victory. They just invited the media into their party room so Joyce could say thank you to New England voters, via the television camera. An ebullient Joyce, who was wearing a visitor’s pass (he doesn’t have official access yet to Parliament House), reminded everyone in the room that they shouldn’t take for granted that they can work in the building. “What an incredible honour it is to be able to walk through the door without one of these things on,” he said, tugging his pass. “Don’t take it for granted. Treasure it. And note that every day is almost a sacred duty you have, the Australian people give you a sacred responsibility, and we have to earn it, and re-earn it, every day we come in here.” He said his re-election proved that New England voters liked what the Nationals stood for, while his time on the campaign trail reminded him that voters will not support politicians in Canberra who lose touch with their electorate. He extended a non-partisan-but-still-obviously-partisan hand to the Greens, saying at least they “fessed up” about colleagues of theirs who were were found to be ineligible to sit in parliament, due to their citizenship status, just like Nationals MPs had done, and unlike Labor. “Bill Shorten, it says something about you … that even to this day you have given us all of these slippery words, you know full well that you have people in your party who have questions to answer and you should have put them out,” he said. “There could have been all these byelections on the one day but you didn’t do it.” Tim Wilson cries as he proposes to Ryan Bolger, again, who is sitting in the gallery. Ryan gives a very enthusiastic yes and it is marked in the Hansard. Mark Dreyfus offers his congratulations before giving his speech. Liberal MP Tim Wilson is talking about his engagement to his partner, Ryan. He tells how he told one person who said “why bother?”, and did not want to throw an engagement party as he thought the muted reaction he received from those who he told meant no one would come. But he says the survey have answered the question for him and the result shows “the Australia we want to be”. Quick trip to the Senate, where Labor’s amendment to reverse the penalty rates cut got up 35 to 26, which meant the government had to vote against its own bill. Labor MPs went over to pay homage to Penny Wong and Louise Pratt following Bill Shorten’s speech. But there is a lot of cross-party support here as well. Terri Butler gave Trent Zimmerman’s shoulder a squeeze as she walked by. Liberal MPs are also stopping by to chat to Dean Smith and George Brandis. A little more from Bill Shorten’s speech and then I’ll grab some of Mike Bowers’ pictures for you. I think this is an uplifting moment in our nation but we need to be mindful to match our joy without humility. Humility to acknowledge on so long on marriage equality, Australia has trailed the world. The humility to seek forgiveness from LGBTQI Australians, forgiveness I speak of the long delay but the injustices and the indignities are both great and small. Forgiveness for subjecting you and your relationships to public judgment. Forgiveness for the hurt and harm you and your families have suffered. We seek your forgiveness, we salute your courage and we thank you for including us in your historic moment. And, let me be clear, in voting for marriage equality, the campaigners for marriage equality have not just delivered equality for them, they have made the Australian identity better. The gift of this legislation is not just in allowing people to get married, the gift of the legislation is it says Australia can be a better place, a more inclusive place. I want to say to all these LGBTQI Australians who found themselves for subsequent days examining the result, seeing it as some kind of reflection on them in percentage terms, let me declare this. You are not 61% anything, you are 100% equal, 100% loved and you are 100% right to live your life the way you want and we are lucky to count each and every one of you as our fellow Australians. This law is not the end of the ancient institution of marriage. It is a new beginning for a more equal world. In a generation to come, I hope and imagine that Australians will look back to these days and this debate and most will wonder what was the fuss all about. My children will attend the weddings of their friends and not give a moment’s thought to whether they are gay or straight, whether it is in a church or a park. All that will matter is do the couple love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together. All that will matter is that they are people like us, our friends, neighbours, our family members, our loved ones, our fellow Australians. This moment, this debate, this week, belongs to all those who have waited. This moment belongs to all those who have fought. It belongs to all those who did not live to see their dream realised, it belongs to those who have felt that inequality in the law has meant they are unequal in our eyes. We have come too late to this moment but we are here at last. Today is an outstanding day when we vote on this bill will be an outstanding moment. It will be, I predict, an uplifting moment. So it is with joy, with humility, with privilege, with love for our brothers and sisters and, with hope in our future, I commenced this bill to the house. Katharine Murphy is in the chamber and reports that Labor is out in force for Shorten’s speech. Penny Wong and Louise Pratt are also in the chamber. The other side of the chamber is looking a little bare. We count Warren Entsch, Trent Zimmerman, Trevor Evans, Tim Wilson and a couple of other Liberals. Oh, and Tony Abbott. Bill Shorten is now speaking on the bill. This is a chance for our parliament to demonstrate that we are worthy of the people that we serve. A chance to honour the courage of LGBTIQ Australians to recognise our rights and celebrate our love. It is a chance to atone for the inaction and failures of the past. After years of discrimination, disappointment and delay, to write into law a truth that we know in our hearts. Marriage is defined by love and loyalty, not gender. And while this final legal change depends on the overdue vote of our parliament, today is not actually about the parliamentarians. For me today, it is about the teenager in the country town who stood in front of his footy club, asked his teammates to support him to be the person that he has always been. Today is about an office worker in the city who challenged her colleagues to put aside their old thoughtless prejudices and respect her right to equality. Today is about tens of thousands of loving same-sex couples who prove every day that they are wonderful parents, parents raising brilliant kids ... Today belongs to all the LGBTIQ Australians who have borne the burden of a long battle for equality. Some of whom could deservedly be described as proud warriors who remember when their very existence was considered to be a criminal offence but always knew it was the law that had to change and not their love. The Brisbane MP Trevor Evans also seems to point to not wanting amendments in his speech on the bill. Brisbane voted yes overwhelmingly – 79.5%. I was at the Brisbane Pride ball this year, where Evans was heckled as he gave his speech in support of marriage equality, while part of a government which was then blocking it. He took the heckles then but seems very pleased to be able to deliver this speech today. This is a bill that finds a good balance between the need to protect important religious freedoms while still implementing the clear will of the Australian people to change the marriage act to allow same-sex couples to marry. This bill contains specific protections for religious organisations, it contains protections for individual ministers of religion, even if they are acting outside the tenants of that organised religion. It contains protections for the civil celebrants and four chaplains and for businesses and organisations and other bodies if they are set up probably for religious purposes ... I accept that not all religious organisations agree with this bill, and nor do all of the gay advocacy groups, but this bill does have the blessing of many of the religious organisations and gay advocacy groups that are capable of reaching agreement on this matter. This bill has the support because it doesn’t open any new forms of discrimination and equally, it does not remove any religious freedoms or protections. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, it is with pride and joy and love that I second this bill. It is a good bill. It strikes a good balance and it enjoys wide support across our community. Now that the Brisbane community and the broader Australian community has voiced its strong support to the same-sex marriage, it is time for us in this parliament to do all bit. This week, in the businesslike fashion. I second this bill. George Brandis is also in the House. For those asking, Barnaby Joyce is in the party room, not yet the parliament. And yes, he is considered a “visitor”. The Fairfax-Ipsos poll was also published today. It reported the same 53 to 47 result to Labor. It also found that 71 per cent of respondents do not think the prime minister should be rolled. Which just makes me wonder what the other respondents were thinking, and whether they had paid any attention over the last seven years or so. TFW you are just wondering what John Wayne would do As my colleague Paul Karp just pointed out, there are a lot of MPs on the speaking list for this one. A lot. I think the predictions we won’t see a vote on this until at least Wednesday night is correct. Senator Dean Smith is in the House watching as Entsch speaks on the bill. Entsch seems a little choked up. It has been a long time coming for him, as he said, and he makes a point of saying he doesn’t believe the “religious freedom” amendments needs to be part of this debate. This bill is about marriage and only about marriage. Nothing in this bill takes away the existing rights of freedom. It doesn’t create different classes of marriage. What it does is give same-sex marriage the same legal rights as other couples. We have made sure we have removed any element of discrimination in this bill while ensuring that religious freedoms are protected. The LGBTQI couples will be free to marry the person they love in the civil marriage and religious marriage celebrants to only perform religious marriages in accordance to religious beliefs remains unchanged. There may be an amendment is proposed, amendments on free speech, discrimination, education, charity law and tax law. They are all worthy causes and important debates but they don’t need to form part of this bill today. Australia’s sick of excuses and are sick of delays. The majority [voted] yes on same-sex couples being able to marry in this country that they call home in front of friends and family that loved them. They did not vote for a new form of discrimination. Amendments about unrelated issues, amendments which seek to delay same-sex marriage, with a 61.6% of Australians who made their preferences clear ... amendments who seek to unwind or remove any legal rights or discrimination protections will be posed. Australians did not vote for fairness and equality to have their rights peeled away this bill. He finishes and there is applause. But it’s naive to think there is not going to be a very rough amendment debate. Warren Entsch, rainbow tie and all (no one tell Ian Macdonald), has the floor and is talking about the marriage equality legislation. As you are well aware, I have been a longtime advocate to changes in this area and initially found the journey to be very lonely but something that I was absolutely determined to do. In 2004, when the parliament changed the definition of marriage to exclude LGBTIQ Australian, I stood in the party room and questioned the decision. I didn’t understand why we needed to do this. Hadn’t LGBTIQ people been through enough? Why do we need to kick them on the way out the door? To me, it did not make any sense, denying any Australian equal status, and the same of dignity and respect is, in my mind, completely unAustralian. To me, it was really quite simple – I don’t understand how one section of our community should be treated any different to any other. Life is tough enough and sometimes very hard. And if you are lucky enough to find someone to join you in the good and the bad, well, in my mind, it is fantastic. I strongly believe that couples seeking would like a strengthening the institution of marriage. There have been a lot of commentary about the length of my advocacy and some very flattering remarks in the media. I was labelled as fiercely heterosexual, far north Queensland ... liberal. However, the 12 or 13 years I have been raising this issue to seek the removal of legal and financial discrimination within the gay and the transgender community, and also educating for the right to same-sex and couples to marry, has been relatively short. Compared to those Australians who have had to endure these inequalities of their entire life. Pyne ends the resolution with a celebration over the New England result: We had a byelection in New England, which we have spectacularly won on the weekend, and we have a spectacular win on Saturday, a record-breaking win, the biggest win for a government in a byelection by the way since 1911. Since 1911! The swing was bigger than the Labor vote. As the deputy leader of the House points out, Mr Speaker, we have a byelection in Bennelong as referred to this morning, Mr Speaker. So we have done the right thing on this side the House but I think it is in everyone’s interest to make sure that everyone sitting in the parliament is legitimately sitting here and that is why we move this motion and I look forward to the support of the opposition and the crossbench. I know the government is very excited and all about the New England byelection result but I can’t help but think that if Bennelong doesn’t go its way, or it comes close to not going its way (and honestly, I have no idea how it will all play out on 16 December), the reaction has to go both ways. You can find the whole motion here: Christopher Pyne has the floor in the House of Representatives moving the citizenship resolution. Once those disclosures are in, the parliament will decide how any referrals to the high court will occur – basically, will the government follow through on its threat to use its numbers (plus one crossbencher) to refer opposition members? The bells are ringing. Hope you’re all ready. Burke also popped up on ABC radio this morning. Responding to questions about Bill Shorten’s meeting with Huang Xiangmo, which came after a 2015 Asio briefing on the potential for Chinese interference with Australian politics, Burke said Labor had responded as the advice had strengthened and stopped taking foreign donations. And this is why as the security advice strengthened Labor took a decision that the government still hasn’t taken that for the people who had concerns raised about them we would stop taking donations from them, even if that put us at a disadvantage. And you’re talking about people who have been significant donors to both sides of politics. You know, for every photo of Bill Shorten there’s a photo of Julie Bishop or some senior member of the government with the people concerned. But Labor, as the advice strengthened, took the decision that we would no longer be taking donations and to this day even for donations to the Bennelong byelection the government won’t rule out whether or not they’re receiving that no matter what advice they get from the security agencies. As for calls to “sack” Sam Dastyari, well, my understanding is he could be disendorsed by the party. But it can’t remove him from the Senate. But nothing like a bit of hubris to kick the morning along. Tony Burke has been out and about this morning. Here is a bit of what he had to say about the government’s threat to refer Labor members to the high court, a massive break from convention, which has the potential to have a lot of implications for the future: The government, in cancelling parliament last week, thought they were going to avoid chaos. This government’s able to deliver chaos all on its own. It doesn’t need parliament to help with that. But today, the parliament will have to make a very significant decision because there is a change in the way this place is going to operate. Mr Turnbull has made clear that we will no longer have the practice where referrals are made to the high court on the basis that members of parliament come forward and indicate that they want their cases checked by the high court. He said now it will be made, those decisions would be made by rival political parties and he’s already flagged his intention for the Liberal party to move motions of that nature against Labor and against the Xenophon team. We can’t have a situation, if they’re the new rules, where the new rules apply to the benefit of the Liberal party and no one else. At the moment, the government is going down a path where the parliament will be able to refer members of the Labor party or the crossbench to the high court but will not be able to refer members of the Liberal or National parties any more to the high court if those motions are moved by the Labor party. We need to have a change resolved by the parliament today that, at the end of this week, any member of parliament can move that somebody should be referred to the high court and, if the majority of the parliament votes that way, then the referral will happen. It is born to rule to the extreme. To have a situation where the Liberal party can refer its opponents to the high court but nobody else can do the same back to the Liberal party. It’s not a surprising approaching from Mr Turnbull but it’s completely unacceptable and we’ll be pushing in the parliament today to make sure that we don’t have yet another example of one rule for Mr Turnbull and another rule for everybody else. Someone is having a good morning. Christopher Pyne, who has been subjected to attacks from both Peta Credlin and Andrew Bolt in recent months, seems to be enjoying how they were dragged into the George Christensen non-event. That would be where Bolt admitted he was “authorised” to send a message to the government that an unnamed MP was going to quit if Malcolm Turnbull wasn’t dumped, only for Christensen to reverse course. Again. Speaking to the ABC this morning, Pyne was positively chipper. “I think it is interesting that George Christensen apparently made those comments to Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin, who are supposed to be columnists and journalists, and they were engaged in that discussion with him,” he said. Barnaby Joyce will address the Nationals’ party room at 10.30. It is amazing how encouraged a government that claims not to govern by Newspoll is by the New England byelection result. They are taking it as an endorsement of the government. I would have thought it was probably more a reaction to the high court decision more than anything, given that there didn’t seem a lot of people there happy with the ruling, but what would I know? The Brotherhood of St Laurence has released its report into long-term unemployment. From its release: Among 267,000 unemployed people aged 15 to 24 in Australia, almost one in five – or 50,500 young people – fall into the ‘long-term unemployed’ category; that is, they have been out of work for a year or more. Amid recent improvements in overall unemployment, the national anti-poverty group’s analysis of Australia Bureau of Statistics data paints a more uncertain picture for millennial job hunters in the labour market. The Brotherhood’s latest report said the consequence of the 2008 global financial crisis remains defining in the trajectory of Australia’s youth unemployment story. Long-term youth unemployment in Australia is presently three times the number it was before the GFC hit and youth unemployment generally has been hard to shift in the fast-changing modern economy, according to the report, Reality Bites: Australia’s youth employment in a millennial era. Released as part of the Brotherhood of Laurence’s campaign for youth employment, the report points out that the unemployment rate for 15 to 24-year-olds in the labour force sits stubbornly high at 12.4% (trend rate in October 2017) – more than double the overall unemployment rate of 5.5%. Digging deeper to probe stereotypes of unemployed youth, the report also analysed Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey data and found that unemployed youth undertake as wide a range of job search activities as older jobseekers. “Blaming young unemployed people for their predicament is simply not supported by the facts,” the report said. You can find more information here The Nationals MP Darren Chester says it is disappointing that his Liberal National colleague from Queensland, George Christensen, lied to journalists and others about his plans to quit the Coalition. He said in the “spirit of Christmas” we should forgive George and move on. Christensen admitted on the weekend that he was the anonymous Turnbull government backbencher who had been threatening to quit the government last week but that Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to open a royal commission into the banking industry had changed his mind. Christensen’s decision to stay with the government infuriated News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, who responded by revealing yesterday that Christensen had encouraged him and Sky News host Peta Credlin to “spread the word” last week that an unnamed Coalition MP was about to quit the government if Turnbull did not step down as leader. Bolt said the tactic was designed to “create maximum pressure on Turnbull” but it ended up going nowhere because Christensen wimped out on his threat. Chester told the ABC on Monday that it was “disappointing” that Christensen had “misled a few people” but he hoped we could move on from it. “He needs to reflect on that and I’ll have a chat to George privately this week,” he said. “He’s someone that I’ve always regarded as a mate. I think he’s made a blue but he’s owned up to it. In the spirit of Christmas, I think we should forgive him and move on.” When asked about the role that Bolt and Credlin played in the conspiracy, Chester said it raised an important point about “what is the role of journalists”. “I don’t like the thought that there are active players behind the scenes trying to conspire to bring down a prime minister,” he said. “I’m not sure that’s the role of a journalist or columnist.” He did not mention the fact that Credlin is a former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, nor that Bolt is a partisan commentator and entertainer rather than a journalist. Darren Chester was just on Sky saying he did not believe Sam Dastyari would last the week. That is picking up from Malcolm Turnbull who added from his comments last week calling on Dastyari to step down or be sacked from the parliament, with this yesterday: “He has betrayed Australia’s interests. How Shorten can stick with Dastyari and represent himself as a fit and proper person to be prime minister of Australia is utterly beyond me. Dastyari took thousands of dollars from a Chinese businessman, Mr Huang, to pay off his personal debts. That in itself was incredible, incredibly wrong. He did so and then went to a function for Chinese media and read a script – we haven’t found out who wrote it – he read a script in which he abandoned the Labor party’s policy on the South China Sea and essentially delivered the talking points that could have been written by somebody in Beijing. That was also an extraordinary betrayal of Australia’s national interests. Then, we now know he goes to a meeting with Mr Huang and tells him they should leave their phones inside and walk out into the garden so that they can’t be listened into by Australian security agencies. I mean, Dastyari must go. He is not putting Australia first and Shorten is utterly failing as a leader to leave him in the Senate. Just on marriage equality, here is what the prime minister had to say about those “religious freedom” amendments George Brandis moved in the Senate (and was defeated on), on Sky News on Sunday: There are others that I may not be aware of but, broadly speaking, I support the amendments that George Brandis moved in the Senate that weren’t adopted. In particular, I don’t believe that a celebrant, a marriage celebrant, should be obliged to celebrate any wedding they don’t want to. You know, we could make this very simple, just simply say that if you’re authorised to celebrate a marriage, you’re not obliged to celebrate any particular marriage that you choose not to. You know, there a plenty of marriage celebrants. No one is every going to have difficulty finding someone to celebrate their marriage, so you just deal with that in a very practical way. The other point that George raised – there are other amendments of similar intent – is to make it clear that there is nothing in the bill that prevents or inhibits or hinders anyone from expressing their views about what is the right, you know ‘morally right’ form of marriage. I mean there are plenty of things that are legal but that people reasonably feel are morally wrong. Adultery is wrong but it’s not illegal. Marrying somebody who has been divorced before, who has been married before, is perfectly legal but many churches teach that that is not in accordance with their teachings. So people are entitled to express their own heartfelt views on these issues and that shouldn’t be inhibited. You know, frankly, the bill doesn’t do that, it doesn’t inhibit it. So what what George has proposed, what George proposed to the Senate, was really belt and braces to confirm that which was already plain. I have legitimately never heard of this word before. Never. Newspoll #24 has Labor leading the Coalition 53 to 47 points on the two-party preferred measure. That’s a slight bump from the 55 to 45 poll in the last Newspoll. It really speaks volumes that being behind, but not being as behind, is seen as a win by this government. Any Coalition MPs who haven’t checked their emails as yet, a secret squirrel has passed this along to us from Nola Marino: Members, including ministers, should attend the members’ annex at 9.30 today for a briefing with the prime minister, leader of the House and chief whip about proceedings in the House this week. Thank you for your cooperation. The House sits at 10, with the citizenship resolution up first. For those wanting to follow along with the disclosures once they are published, you will find them here. They should be up from midday. The House disclosures are due by 8pm on Tuesday. The Senate is also sitting at 10, where the Fair Work bill is up first. Penalty rates will be part of this. The House will probably get around to voting on marriage equality midweek. Looks like we are not the only one preparing for a rough day. George Christensen is indulging in the age-old tradition of Vague Booking to make his feelings know this morning. I hope everyone has had their breakfast and is gripping an extra large coffee, because you are going to need it today. Barnaby Joyce romped it in at the New England election (no surprises there) and the government is hoping that is the start of a much-needed reset. The Turnbull government has lost its 24th Newspoll in a row (Malcolm Turnbull rolled Tony Abbott after 30). But the government is hopeful that the return of Joyce will bring the Nationals back in line. Joyce will attend party room today, which might be a slightly uncomfortable time for George Christensen who outed himself as the unnamed MP who “authorised” Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin to make known he was planning on quitting the government if Turnbull remained PM. Christensen, who denied to multiple journalists he was the MP in question, said he changed his mind about quitting after the government capitulated and decided to hold a royal commission into the banks. This is about the third or fourth time Christensen has made this threat and not followed through. Doubt he is in for a good day. Then again, the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, is standing by his Friday call that Turnbull should stand down and give the nation a Christmas present. Oh to be a fly on the party room meeting wall. Also unlikely to have a good day is Sam Dastyari, as the government continues to seek the Labor senator’s resignation following revelations he met with a Chinese donor and warned him he was probably under surveillance by intelligence agencies. Bill Shorten demoted him last week but said he hadn’t broken any laws. On the weekend Turnbull said one shouldn’t assume Dastyari wasn’t under investigation. But either way the government is now seeking to tighten up some laws and will act on banning foreign donations. Shorten himself is in the news, with Fairfax Media reporting he met with the Chinese donor in question, Huang Xiangmo, to secure donations ahead of the 2016 federal election, despite Asio warning the major parties about possible Chinese influence in Australian politics in 2015. Both major parties have dealings with Huang, with the Daily Telegraph reporting over the weekend one of Huang’s former advisers has joined John Alexander’s Bennelong byelection campaign. Stay tuned. And all of that before we even get to the citizenship declarations, which are due this week. Christopher Pyne has warned the government will go against convention and refer Labor members with questions over the timing of their renouncements to the high court. Turnbull swears there are no other Coalition members with questions, something he said before Stephen Parry resigned over dual citizenship and then John Alexander resigned over dual citizenship. So it should be a fun week. Then there is marriage equality, which hits the House this week, with a question over whether it will get through without “religious freedoms” amendments. Penalty rates are also on the agenda. Who knows what else this week will throw up? Certainly not a festive spirit. As always, Mike Bowers, fresh from Tamworth, is prowling the halls and chambers. Follow along with him here and here. You can reach me in the comments, or on twitter at @amyremeikis with updates here (including on the Queensland election, just head to the story) as well. I am on coffee number three, so it’s going to be a great day! Ready? Let’s get started."

2017-11-02T06:01:47Z,Climate change 'will create world's biggest refugee crisis',"Tens of millions of people will be forced from their homes by climate change in the next decade, creating the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen, according to a new report. Senior US military and security experts have told the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) study that the number of climate refugees will dwarf those that have fled the Syrian conflict, bringing huge challenges to Europe. “If Europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years,” said retired US military corps brigadier general Stephen Cheney. “See what happens when climate change drives people out of Africa – the Sahel [sub-Saharan area] especially – and we’re talking now not just one or two million, but 10 or 20 [million]. They are not going to south Africa, they are going across the Mediterranean.” The study published on Thursday calls on governments to agree a new legal framework to protect climate refugees and, ahead of next week’s climate summit in Germany, urges leaders to do more to implement the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement. Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, told the EJF: “What we are talking about here is an existential threat to our civilisation in the longer term. In the short term, it carries all sorts of risks as well and it requires a human response on a scale that has never been achieved before.” The report argues that climate change played a part in the build up to the Syrian war, with successive droughts causing 1.5 million people to migrate to the country’s cities between 2006 and 2011. Many of these people then had no reliable access to food, water or jobs. “Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences,” said EJF executive director, Steve Trent. “In our rapidly changing world climate change – and its potential to trigger both violent conflict and mass migration – needs to be considered as an urgent priority for policymakers and business leaders alike.” Although the report highlights to growing impact of climate change on people in the Middle East and Africa, it says changing weather patterns – like the hurricanes that devastated parts of the US this year – prove richer nations are not immune from climate change. But Trent said that although climate change undoubtedly posed an “existential threat to our world” it was not to late to take decisive action. “By taking strong ambitious steps now to phase out greenhouse gas emissions and building an international legal mechanism to protect climate refugees we will protect the poorest and most vulnerable in our global society, build resilience, reap massive economic benefits and build a safe and secure future for our planet. Climate change will not wait. Neither can we. For climate refugees, tomorrow is too late.”"
2017-11-04T01:27:39Z,UN attacks Australia's 'inhumane' refugee-processing system,"The United Nations human rights commission has denounced the Australian government for withdrawing support to former Manus Island detainees as the stand-off over the provision of services to more than 600 men enters its fifth day. It comes as detainees on Nauru call for an investigation into the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker, who was killed in a road accident on the island nation on Thursday. In a statement, Rupert Colville, spokesman for high commissioner Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, said the UN’s human rights committee had “serious concerns about the welfare, safety and wellbeing” of the men who remained at the centre in Papua New Guinea, which was formally decommissioned on Tuesday. Water to the centre and essential medical services were also cut off on Tuesday, while electricity was disconnected on Wednesday morning. The men have been digging for water. Colville said the men were “too frightened to leave”. “We call on the Australian government, as the party who interned the men in the first place, to immediately provide protection, food, water and other basic services which have been cut off since authorities shuttered the facility on 31 October,” he said. The commission repeated its criticism that Australia’s offshore refugee processing regime was “unsustainable, inhumane and contrary to its human rights obligations” and said asylum seekers and refugees should be immediately transferred to Australia for processing. Rallies in support of the Manus refugees were held in Canberra and Brisbane on Friday and planned for Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday. Colville said Australia and PNG had responsibilities under the 1951 Refugee Convention to protect and provide for the men. “The men have said they fear they will be subjected to violence at the hands of locals if they leave the compound – and, given there have been violent incidents in the past, we believe these fears should be respected and satisfactorily addressed,” he said. ‘All migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, are human beings. Like all of us, they have a right to a safe and secure environment, a right to an adequate standard of living and to participate in the decision-making process that is affecting their future. “Human dignity should be ensured throughout the entire processing of their asylum claims. We urge the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea to fully respect their human rights, including their specific rights under international refugee law, and to enter into a dialogue with the men to ensure these rights are duly respected, protected and fulfilled.” The Australian government has rejected claims it abandoned the detainees, saying water, power and medical services are available at three alternative accommodation facilities that can be “accessed at any time,” and that comfortable and secure transport to take them to those facilities is also “standing by”. The government has not addressed a report made by the UN high commissioner for refugees, which inspected the alternative accommodation this week and said one of the units was not ready for occupation. On Nauru, police reportedly arrested a man connected to a fatal crash that resulted in the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker from Bangladesh, but detainees at the Nauru regional processing centre were concerned about the circumstances of the accident. The man, who has been in Nauru for more than three years, died in a collision between the motorcycle he was riding and another vehicle on the road to Fly Camp, the detention centre for single men, about 2pm local time on Thursday. Guardian Australia has attempted to contact the Nauruan government and the Australian immigration department to confirm the arrest. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul has called for a full investigation to determine the circumstances of the crash. “There is a lot of suspicion about what has happened,” Rintoul told Guardian Australia. “The fact that refugees are routinely hated just heightens their concerns even more.” The government of Nauru released a statement on Thursday saying “reports on social media alleging this was more than an accident are false”. “Police are investigating the accident and no other details are yet available,” the statement said. “The Government of Nauru extends its sincere sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased.” On Friday, opposition leader Bill Shorten urged prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to accept a renewed offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore processing camps, saying it was similar to the US resettlement deal brokered with former US president Barack Obama. Australia rejected the offer when it was first made by former New Zealand prime minister John Key in 2013, saying people smugglers would see it as a way to provide backdoor entry to Australia. Turnbull is scheduled to meet New Zealand’s new prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, this weekend."
2017-09-12T06:00:27Z,Smugglers make test runs with migrants across deadly Black Sea route,"A dangerous new route for refugees trying to reach Europe is thought to have opened up in the Black Sea, which coastguards in Romania are warning could prove more deadly than existing Mediterranean crossings. As neighbouring countries struggle with the refugee crisis that has prompted millions to flee conflicts in the Middle East, Romania has largely been bypassed. However, events over the past few days suggest its waters are being eyed by smugglers keen to avoid crackdowns elsewhere. On Saturday, the Romanian coastguard intercepted a fishing boat in the Black Sea with 97 migrants on board, 36 of them children. Border police said that they were Iranian and Iraqi nationals, picked up close to the Romanian-Bulgarian sea border. The evening before, coastguards had spotted another boat heading for Romanian territorial waters. The fishing boat, carrying about 120 people, was intercepted by border police and handed over to Turkish coastguards. On 3 September, a fishing boat carrying 87 migrants, was stopped as it sailed towards the Romanian coast on the Black Sea. That boat is believed to have set out from the northern coast of Turkey. The coastguard also intercepted a boat with 68 asylum seekers off the Romanian coast on 21 August. A few days later, 150 Syrian refugees were discovered boarding a fishing boat in Turkey heading for Romania. On 13 August the coastguard had found 69 Iraqi migrants in a boat in Romanian waters. While these numbers remain small compared with the hundreds of thousands who have made the perilous crossing between Turkey and Greece, it could still be a significant development. Romania’s interior minister, Carmen Dan, visited the Black Sea border police last week. “We treat migrants as people who need help, not criminals,” she said. Krzysztof Borowski, a spokesperson for the EU border protection agency Frontex, said it was too early to discuss the incidents as a change in trend, pointing to the limited number of episodes over a short period of time. But he said Frontex was viewing the incident as an attempt by smugglers in Turkey to reactivate the Black Sea route. “In the past it has been used. In 2014 we had 430 people arrive by the Black Sea to Romania and Bulgaria. In 2015 it was 68. In 2016 it was one. Perhaps there is a move to reactivate, for smugglers to put people through there and test it,” he said. According to Borowski, weather conditions on the Black Sea are often worse than in the Mediterranean, with stronger winds. “Migrants are in bigger danger, especially if they take smaller vessels. It is a rough sea and a difficult one to cross,” he said. Gabriela Leu, a spokesperson for UNHCR Romania, says that while it was difficult to draw a conclusion from a handful of incidents, “what is clear is that when legal avenues are closed, people fleeing war and persecution take desperate measures to find safety”. She said that the agency was very concerned about all refugees and migrants who take to the sea in unseaworthy boats, and especially about people who entrust their safety to human smugglers. “The likelihood of dying while trying to reach Europe along people-smuggling routes is alarmingly high.” Romanian authorities have so far taken into custody six individuals on suspicion of human trafficking related to the incidents, including two Turks, a Bulgarian, a Syrian, an Iraqi and a Cyprian. Sea routes are notoriously dangerous. Between January and July 2017, 2,224 migrants died trying to cross the Med, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Border police say no one has died trying to cross into Romania in recent years. Romania, which is outside the Schengen zone, has largely escaped the refugee crisis; few migrants have targeted Romania as an end destination and most have chosen more well-trodden routes to western Europe. However, the number of people trying to cross Romania’s land borders illegally has also been on the rise. According to data from the Romanian border police, in the first seven months of 2017, 2,800 people were caught trying to illegally cross Romania’s borders, up from 1,624 in the whole of 2016. The majority, 1,370 people, were from Iraq, followed by 525 from Syria and 319 from Pakistan. Questions remain over Romania’s preparedness to handle an influx of refugees. The country was one of the nations that initially resisted the setting up of an EU-wide quota in 2015 to redistribute refugees among member states. However, it later agreed to take in around 4,200 asylum seekers. As of the end of August, 727 people had been relocated to Romania, though there are suggestions that many are choosing not to stay in the country due to the limited opportunities. “They don’t want to come to Romania to stay, they just want to get into the EU and then move on,” said Răzvan Samoilă, executive director at Arca, an NGO in Bucharest that offers assistance to refugees and migrants. “It is the same thing with the resettlement procedure,” he said. “Already, we’ve had four groups coming to Romania and none of them are now in Romania.” Samoilă said these latest incidents on the Black Sea are test runs by smugglers, although he believes that the water and weather conditions are against them. “The Mediterranean is not like the Black Sea. In the Black Sea, you don’t know what will happen in 20 minutes’ time,” he said. “These migrants who took this route on the Black Sea must have experienced a very hard journey.”"
2017-11-20T04:59:51Z,Making the no vote about migrants ignores a fundamental thing | Naaman Zhou,"Within minutes of last Wednesday’s historic yes vote for marriage equality, the narrative was about western Sydney. Twelve electorates there recorded a majority no vote. Some, like Greenway, did so by a bare 53%, but others like Blaxland, held by Labor’s Jason Clare, hit 75% – the highest in the country. The finger was quickly pointed at the multicultural community, with these electorates having a higher-than-average, but by no means astronomical, proportion of residents from non-English speaking backgrounds. The link between migrants and the no vote – which is fairly flimsy mathematically – has been handled as though it were gospel truth. The result has been pitched as some kind of crisis in progressive politics: a brewing clash between racial tolerance and LGBTI rights, where only one can win. But this analysis ignores a pretty fundamental thing about statistics and about people. They change. Poll western Sydney again in six months and opposition will be down. Poll Australia once it has lived under legalised marriage equality and opposition will be down. I’ll bet my bottom dollar. The no campaign spoke the language of hypotheticals and nightmares. They targeted migrant communities and said same-sex unions would ruin existing marriages. That small business owners would be prosecuted by litigious gay couples demanding cakes. That you simply could not know what would happen. Once people realise same-sex marriage hasn’t ruined their lives, once they see the joy it brings to friends and family with no detriment to others, opposition will naturally drop. I don’t expect a backlash, I expect acceptance. This isn’t blue-sky, optimistic thinking – it’s a process that happens to any law or policy. We seem to have forgotten how opinion polls work. If you survey the nation in November about an unenacted law, then ask again once people have lived under it, minds will have changed. Across Australia – among the multicultural communities, the religious, and those who voted no but had the good fortune to be Anglo-Saxon or middle-class enough to not be immediately made the talking point – acceptance of marriage equality will come sooner than we think. The idea that these 12 electorates were the sole stronghold of the no vote is obviously artificial, and just bad maths. The opposition to marriage equality was high on the government benches. The opposition among One Nation candidates is well above the 75% in Blaxland. So why are we picking on the multicultural community? Statistics show that the factor most correlated with voting no was religion, not overseas birth. People have conveniently ignored that some of Australia’s most multicultural electorates, such as Wills in Victoria, Moreton in Brisbane, and Sydney’s Grayndler, Kingsford Smith and Bradfield all registered yes votes over 60%. It’s also demographically wrong to treat western Sydney as though it is purely non-white. Put bluntly, Anglo-Australians voted no too. The Anglican church gave the no campaign $1m. Homophobia in migrant communities is of course an important, worthwhile and entrenched issue – but it is much too complex for this blunt instrument of a survey. A discussion should be had, but not one based on a six-week poll pushed through the post and buffeted by a campaign of deliberate uncertainty. Some say the yes campaign should have worked harder in western Sydney. That may be true, but it shouldn’t be seen as some great moral failing, nor should it affect the legitimacy of the yes win. When Malcolm Turnbull won the 2016 election on a one-seat majority, no one pointed to the 74 electorates that registered a majority no vote against him. But if yes were a political party, it would have won 133 seats out of 150. There are millions and millions of multicultural Australians who voted yes – my queer friends, myself, my mum, my grandmother. It speaks of an insane double standard we push onto marginalised communities – not only do they have to win, they have to win a majority in every seat and in every mind. It’s not enough that the multicultural community voted, with the rest of Australia, overwhelmingly for marriage equality, if a few supposedly “ethnic” electorates did not. Those who push this multiculturalism against LGBTI rights angle are creating an exaggerated conflict between tolerances and are rarely on the side of either. Ethnic Australians are not a static, unthinking monolith. They are humans who listen to their children and grandchildren. Who can recognise joy and love when they see it. Who can change their minds. Some won’t – but that happens everywhere, not just in western Sydney. Opinion polls and elections divide communities. It’s what they are designed to do. But the one constant across history is that tolerance is a fairly universal language –maybe the message got lost this time, or maybe the case wasn’t made properly. Maybe it wasn’t listened to. But it will be. Naaman Zhou is a reporter for Guardian Australia"
2017-11-27T12:21:44Z,"Red carpets, refugee camps and royalty: the life of Meghan Markle","Meghan Markle was born in Los Angeles in August 1981, six days after the wedding of Prince Harry’s parents 5,500 miles away in St Paul’s Cathedral, London. Her parents were Thomas Markle, an Emmy award-winning TV lighting designer originally from Pennsylvania, and Doria Ragland, a temp office worker posted at the same studio at the time they met. They had married in 1979. With a white father and black mother, Markle later recalled the problems they experienced in the largely white Valley area of the city. “There was my mom, caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny,” Markle wrote last year. Ragland worked as a yoga instructor and, in Markle’s words, “a free-spirited clinical therapist”. Markle’s mother raised her to have her “eyes open to sometimes harsh realities”, she wrote in Elle magazine. They took trips to places such as Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, where Markle was struck by seeing poor children peddling sweets for a few pesos on the streets. Her Instagram feed hints at possibly leftish politics too. In July 2016 when anti-Brexit protesters marched in London she posted a picture of a placard saying “If EU leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me”. She may also be alone in Royal circles in enjoying the work of Noam Chomsky, whose book critiquing the rise of undemocratic elites in the US, “Who Rules The World”, she described as “a great read”. As for US politics she posted “I’m with her” about Hillary Clinton. Markle’s parents divorced in 1988. Three years later, aged 11, their daughter wrote to the then first lady, Hillary Clinton, to complain about a sexist TV advertisement. The ad, which she had seen in a classroom, had the tagline: “Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans”. After she rallied support, the reference to “women” was changed to “people”. Ragland still lives in Los Angeles, and Prince Harry was furious when she was inundated by press attention last year over their relationship. He complained of the “bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker and loved one in [Markle’s] life,” and the harassment of Ragland at her home, where she has had to “struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door”. Among the headlines believed to have angered the palace was one on mailonline.com that read: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton.” Markle herself wrote last year in Elle magazine of her own experience of racial stereotyping. “As a biracial woman, I watch in horror as both sides of a culture I define as my own become victims of spin in the media, perpetuating stereotypes and reminding us that the States has perhaps only placed bandages over the problems that have never healed at the root.” Markle’s first TV role came in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002. She went on to TV roles in CSI, Without A Trace and Castle and then appeared in feature films including Get Him To The Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses. Markle married the film producer Trevor Engelson at a four-day wedding party in Jamaica in 2011, but the couple divorced two years later, citing irreconcilable differences. She is best known for her role as a lawyer in the legal drama Suits, shot in Toronto, where she had been living until she packed up her rented house this month. It was during shooting in the summer of last year that Markle is understood to have met Harry for the first time. With her rising TV and Hollywood profile came two parallel careers, one as a lifestyle entrepreneur and the other as a humanitarian activist. Markle established an online brand, The Tig, for “those with a hunger for food, travel, fashion and beauty”. She said it was named after what she called her “ah-ha moment” when she had a sip of the expensive wine Tignanello “which opened up my palate and perspective to wine knowledge”. The site ran for three years but Markle closed it in April as the rumours grew that she and Harry were to marry. She signed off: “Keep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being ‘the change you wish to see in the world’. Above all, don’t ever forget your worth – as I’ve told you time and time again: you, my sweet friend, you are enough.” Markle also became the global ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world. She visited Gihembe refugee camp in Rwanda as an advocate for UN Women, holding meetings with female parliamentarians in the capital, Kigali. Markle is aware of the dissonance between her interest in humanitarianism and her showbusiness career. She recalled, while driving back from the refugee camp, receiving an email from her manager with an invitation to the Bafta awards. “A high-end jewellery company was going to fly me in, dress me in the fanciest of gowns, and I would travel straight from Kigali to Heathrow, London, to the makeup chair and on to the red carpet,” she said. “‘No,’ my heart said. And it wasn’t a soft whisper; it was a lion’s roar.” Markle has named her heroes as the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon. “These are my heroes,” she said. “These are my celebrities.”"
2017-09-27T05:30:34Z,First Nauru refugees leave for US resettlement,"The first 52 refugees to be accepted for resettlement in the United States under a contentious agreement with Australia have left the Pacific island camps where they had been held for years. Their move comes as reports from Washington indicate the US is preparing to announce it is further slashing its overall refugee intake to its lowest level in a decade. The first 25 refugees from the men-only camp on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island had flown out of the capital, Port Moresby, on Tuesday for the United States via the Philippines and Qatar, Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said. Another 27 refugees flew to Port Moresby on Wednesday from a camp in Nauru, he said, also bound, ultimately, for Los Angeles. US government officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday and Australian officials declined to comment. The refugees will be resettled across the United States, including in Georgia, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and Arizona. They will be assisted with housing, physical and mental healthcare, English lessons, enrolment of children in schools, and in finding employment. The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce its new refugee cap for the forthcoming fiscal year – which runs from October to September – at the lowest level in a decade. Shortly after taking office the US president, Donald Trump, issued two travel ban executive orders that directed the US state department to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal year to 30 September. That figure was less than half the 110,000 places the former president Barack Obama had authorised. Court challenges to those orders have resulted in more than 50,000 admitted to the US: the figure was at 51,000 to the end of August. But the figure of 45,000 refugee places, if adopted next fiscal year, would be the lowest refugee acceptance level since 2006. Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said the reported reductions, if true, were a betrayal of the American tradition of helping people escape war and violence. For decades, the US has been the largest third-country resettler of refugees in the world. “Refugees are ordinary people who have lost everything,” Huang said. “They deserve our compassion and concern as they rebuild their lives. Instead, President Trump is prioritising a dangerous agenda of bigotry and hate. We cannot allow fear-mongering to block vulnerable people from gaining safety.” Obama’s administration had agreed to accept up to 1,250 of Australia’s refugees, mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, in exchange for Australia agreeing to accept refugees from the “northern triangle” countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, under a US-led resettlement program. Trump lashed his predecessor’s deal as “dumb”, and complained in a phone call to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that it would “make me look terrible”. Trump ultimately agreed to honour the agreement, subject to “extreme vetting” of refugees. The US is under no obligation to take a set number of refugees. Australian officials are confident the US will resettle somewhere approaching the 1,250 figure publicly speculated, but have conceded the number will not be enough to “clear” Australia’s offshore detention islands and find durable solution for all refugees currently under Australia’s control offshore. Refugee Action Coalition’s Rintoul said there had been no indication how many of the more than 2,000 asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea and Nauru would be left behind. “People [in the camps] are happy that these people have gone, but the big question is what happens to the rest,” he said. “It raises the level of anxiety and uncertainty and that’s been magnified by the fact that US officials have indicated that while they expect that there will be other groups being processed, it could take as long to process the next group of people as it has to process this one, which is several months. “There is no transparency, no timelines, no numbers, no certainty, except the fact that there will be hundreds left behind,” he added. US officials say security is paramount. All refugees approved for travel to the United States from Nauru and Papua New Guinea have passed the same stringent vetting processes that apply to all refugees considered for admission to the United States, and any individual not deemed to have met US vetting requirements will not be admitted. Australia’s asylum policy mandates that no refugee who arrives in Australia by boat can ever be resettled in the country, a policy the government says dissuades asylum seekers from attempting the dangerous and occasionally deadly ocean crossing from Indonesia. Australia instead pays Papua New Guinea and Nauru – at a cost of nearly $10bn over the past four years – to house asylum seekers in camps that have been plagued by consistent revelations of physical violence – including murder – sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death, and catastrophic rates of mental health damage, self-harm, and suicide attempts. More than 2,000 asylum seekers remain in Australia’s offshore system. Many have been held there for more than four years."
2017-11-08T20:54:13Z,Greens unveil plan for diversity targets and multicultural commission,"The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has released a proposal to strengthen multiculturalism in Australia, including an independent multicultural commission and diversity targets in government departments. Di Natale will release draft legislation on Thursday that proposes making government departments and agencies publicly report on diversity within their organisations. The draft plan also includes the establishment of an independent multicultural commission, and is aimed at strengthening protection for culturally and linguistically diverse communities and promoting multiculturalism. It comes after proposed legislation to overhaul citizenship laws and make it harder for migrants to become Australian citizens was struck down by the Senate last month, amid concerns that legislation unfairly targeted those with English as a second language. Di Natale will address the Migration Institute of Australia conference in Melbourne on Thursday to map out his party’s proposed reforms. A draft of his speech, obtained by Guardian Australia, says the government was failing to give migrants certainty about their status or make them feel welcome. “The proposed changes to the citizenship laws can only be described as another attack on migrants,” Di Natale’s speech will say. “They required university level English and an increased wait of four additional years to apply for citizenship. This is a government where deterrence is at the heart of our refugee policy. “It relies on conditions being as bad as the conditions people are fleeing. And it harms the innocent to send a message. Since 31 October, 600 men on Manus have been left to fend for themselves. The lives of these men are in serious danger and the new facilities are not fit for human habitation. They are being denied medical care and clean drinking water.” It was this treatment of refugees and asylum seekers that prompted the Greens to draft their “federal multicultural act”, which the party believes will enshrine multilateral support for multiculturalism in the law. The exposure bill states the proposed legislation will “promote full participation by Australia’s diverse communities in the social, cultural, economic and political life of Australia; promote access by Australia’s diverse communities to services made available by governments and other bodies,” and “encourage all of Australia’s diverse communities to retain and express their social identity and cultural inheritance and to promote mutual respect.” The bill also aims to promote unity, understanding and harmony among Australians and promote the social and economic benefits of diversity. The legislation would require government organisations and departments to provide an annual report to the minister detailing action taken to promote multiculturalism, the use of interpreting and translating services, and the extent to which people from diverse backgrounds were represented on boards and committees. Di Natale’s speech will say that reforms are needed “because multiculturalism is too important to play politics with”. “An Australian multiculturalism act would set up a scaffolding effect that supports multicultural Australia,” he will say. The Greens will consult with the community on the exposure bill and will aim to introduce it to the Senate before the parliamentary term."
2017-12-22T16:56:53Z,Efforts to resettle child refugees under Dubs scheme 'completely inadequate',"The Home Office is facing fresh criticism after confirming it is yet to fill all the spaces it reserved for unaccompanied child refugees from Europe under the Dubs scheme. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, described the government’s approach as “completely inadequate” after it set out its position in its formal response to a report published by the committee earlier this year. Cooper also said her committee would hold fresh hearings on the subject in the future, saying that government claims to be serious about tackling modern slavery “look hollow” in the light of its unwillingness to help unaccompanied children at risk of trafficking on the continent. In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by Lord Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. At the time it was expected that around 3,000 children would benefit from the scheme, but when the government announced details in February 2017 it said only 350 spaces would be available. That number was subsequently increased to 480. On Friday, in its response to the home affairs committee’s report, the Home Office said the number of children who had arrived in the UK under the Dubs scheme was “over 200” and that Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has written to her counterparts in France, Greece and Italy inviting more referrals from eligible children. To be eligible, children have to have arrived in Europe before March 2016 and it has to be in their best interests for them to come to the UK. Priority is supposed to be given to those deemed vulnerable, including at risk from trafficking. In its response to the committee, the Home Office also said the total number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in local authority care in the UK was over 4,000 – around 10 times as many as may eventually be accepted under the Dubs scheme. Dismissing the Home Office response as complacent, Cooper, a Labour MP, said ministers should be doing much more to take advantage of the spaces for unaccompanied child refugees that were available. “Contrary to speedily delivering the Dubs scheme, less than half the places councils offered at the beginning of the year have been filled even though unaccompanied refugee children are spending another winter in camps or other unsuitable shelters in Greece and Italy,” she said. “All the government’s commitments to tackle modern slavery look hollow when they are still resisting implementing a scheme to prevent teenagers being exploited and trafficked in Europe. “This remains a policy failure by the home secretary and the committee will revisit this issue in the future.” The government came up with 480 as the total number of children it could accept after consulting with local councils to see how many they could take. The home affairs committee report earlier this year suggested that a further 4,000 places could be available if councils received appropriate funding from central government. But the Home Office response on Friday said that this figure was wrong because it was based on the assumption that a threshold for the maximum number of child refugees any single authority is supposed to take could become a target for all of them to meet."
2017-11-24T05:40:45Z,Manus detention centre cleared of all refugees and asylum seekers,"The decommissioned Manus Island detention centre has been cleared of all refugees and asylum seekers, the Papua New Guinean police and the Australian government have said. But up to 60 men have been left without a place to stay, because alternative accommodation is either not ready, or already overfull, official sources on the island have told the Guardian. On the second day of Operation Helpim Friend, PNG mobile squad officers raided the detention centre using metal batons against refugees and asylum seekers and forcing them on to buses. Mobile phone footage shot in the centre on Friday morning showed PNG officers threatening and hitting refugees as they dragged men out of the centre. Further footage shows mobile squad officers throwing rocks at the fences behind which refugees are sheltering, in an apparent attempt to intimidate them. An officer yells at a refugee, “Turn the fucking camera off,” before a rock is thrown at him. Other pictures show immigration officials manhandling refugees out of the centre. Refugees reported being beaten with sticks, having their phones seized, medicines destroyed, and other property stolen. More than 300 refugees and asylum seekers – who had been living without running water, electricity, or regular food supplies for three weeks – have been moved to alternative accommodation at Lorengau township. There were some minor injuries reported in the forced removal. At a press conference in Brisbane, the Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said that as far as he knew three people were injured: one was dehydrated, one tripped and had grazings, and the third “has an ankle issue which I think relates to an insect bite”. Asked about the footage, Dutton said he would “like to see [it]” but dismissed “claims made on social media” by arguing that “there are clips taken but a lot of this doesn’t add up to the facts on the ground”. Two men who collapsed on Thursday, when police first entered the compound, were reported to be safe and recovering. The effort to physically clear the camp began on Thursday with about 50 refugees and asylum seekers taken from the detention centre to other accommodation on Manus Island – most of which is not yet fully built, without running water, electricity or security fences. Reports from Manus say there are not enough beds at the new accommodation blocks to house all of the refugees removed from the detention centre. The Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Adam told the Guardian dozens of men left at the East Lorengau centre had no place to stay, and nowhere else they could go. The Iranian refugee Behrouz Boochani said busloads of refugees were left outside the East Lorengau centre and told there was no room for them. The detention centre, where most of the refugees and asylum seekers have been held for more than four years, was officially closed on 31 October. The men who remained there resisted being moved because of a series of violent attacks against refugees in Lorengau and because of a lack of services, especially for health, in the new centres. PNG police said the clearance of the detention centre had been completed without force and that nobody had been handcuffed. Australia has paid to build the new accommodation centres – known as East Lorengau, West Lorengau and Hillside Haus – and remains legally responsible for the welfare of the men. Australian Border Force maintains a significant presence in PNG, and retains effective control of all offshore operations. The Australian government has earmarked between $150m and $250m to be spent on Manus over the next year. Earlier, Dutton said the Australian government welcomed the clearance of the former detention centre. He said food, security and medical services were “operational and have been available since 31 October”. “What is clear is that there has been an organised attempt to provoke trouble and disrupt the new facilities,” Dutton said in a statement. “The Australian government has been advised that some equipment has been sabotaged at the alternative accommodation centres, including damage to back-up generators. Vandalism has also occurred to water infrastructure.” Power lines to generators at Hillside Haus were cut, but this was done by PNG landowners unhappy at the imposition of the refugees’ accommodation block on their land. Local landowners, some armed with machetes, have protested against the centres being built and threatened those inside, PNG government sources have said. The Australian government’s claims that alternative accommodation units are ready and suitable for habitation have been consistently refuted by independent observers, including the UN. On Manus last week, the Guardian witnessed construction on the unfinished sites. Videos and photos from within them have been published showing blocked toilets, bathrooms without running water and buildings still under construction. Refugees and asylum seekers have consistently claimed they are not safe in the new housing in Lorengau, citing frequent violent attacks and a lack of security. Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, said the government should immediately accept New Zealand’s standing offer to resettle 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore centres Nauru and Manus annually. “This out-of-touch prime minister can no longer continue to shirk his responsibility; he must immediately negotiate third-country resettlement options for eligible refugees,” Neumann said. Labor leader, Bill Shorten, released his response to a petition from 12 former Australians of the Year in which he called for resettlement in third countries “as soon as possible” and described Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to refuse New Zealand’s offer as “perplexing”. The Greens immigration spokesman, senator Nick McKim, said: “The siege is over but the danger is not. The violence that Peter Dutton has inflicted on his prisoners is a stain on our national conscience.” On the 10th anniversary of the Rudd government, Turnbull used the issue to attack Labor’s record, attacking Shorten for choosing Kristina Keneally as Labor’s candidate in the Bennelong by-election because she was “a strong advocate for bringing asylum seekers from Manus Island to Australia”. “Kristina Keneally wants to send a signal to the people smugglers: come on down,” he told a press conference in Canberra."
2017-12-24T00:05:36Z,We can’t break a promise to take in child refugees | Barbara Ellen,"Is the plight of lone child refugees yesterday’s news for this government? Is it hoping that the public will simply stop caring and the outrage, the headlines and the problem are just going to melt away? It appears that the Home Office isn’t filling the spaces reserved for unaccompanied child refugees under the Dubs scheme. This year, the places, which were expected to number around 3,000, were announced to be limited to 350. After a public outcry and intervention from the House of Lords, this was increased to 480. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, now says that the number of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK specifically under the Dubs scheme is “over 200”, which sounds carefully vague. (The government has been steadfastly unco-operative about committing to numbers.) Yvette Cooper, in the role of chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says that government promises are looking “hollow” regarding unaccompanied child refugees (who are at grave risk of trafficking and other exploitation) and that the Home Office response is “completely inadequate”. It also sounds chaotic, the mess further complicated by the government saying that there were already around 4,000 lone asylum-seeking children in care in the UK. This figure, if accurate, was brandished at Cooper and the committee as if it were someone else’s doing – that it somehow wasn’t the government’s fault that there was such widespread disorder. Similarly, when Cooper pointed out that 3,000 unaccompanied child refugee places could still be made available by local councils, should further central government funding become available, the response was that this wasn’t an actual target, just a figure relating to the maximum number of child refugees who could be helped. But, or so went the implication, they sure as hell wouldn’t be. Well, thanks for clearing that up. Merry Christmas! It bears repeating that the figure of 3,000 lone child refugees wasn’t plucked out of the “handwringing do-gooder” ether. It was part of the original campaign for the Dubs amendment – in that it was deemed fair and appropriate for Britain to help 3,000 of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees, in the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. (Of course, there are innumerable other child and adult refugees.) To give it some context, around 200,000 asylum seekers were accepted into the UK over a three-year period after the break-up of Yugoslavia. When the figure of 3,000 was so drastically reduced, there was widespread public disgust bordering on national shame. How could the UK restrict the Dubs scheme to helping such a small number of vulnerable, unprotected children? Let’s be clear, nobody, among campaigners or the public, said: “Let everybody in the world come here if they want to”; “Ignore British citizens in need – I prefer helping foreign people!”; “I insist that you let in grown men with beards, and wives, as ‘child refugees’ under the Dubs scheme.” Or write your own ludicrous rightwing smearing of “woolly liberals” that kicks off whenever helping refugees is on the agenda. Rather, there was a very specific reaction to the predicament of lone child refugees – kids who’d gone through so much and were at such high risk. This seems to be the very gut instinct that this government would prefer the British public to forget it ever had. Which makes it even more important for them to be held to account, not just by the Commons committee, but also by public vigilance. The government can’t make insincere “oh dear” noises about lone child refugees and then not even meet the puny total it permitted via the Dubs scheme. It should also respond to ongoing concern about all the other child refugees languishing in dangerous, unsuitable camps and shelters across Europe. As 2017 draws to a close, it would be nice to think that the lone child refugee crisis is top of the agenda for 2018."
2017-11-18T22:00:43Z,First child refugee from Greek camps comes to UK,"More than a year after the UK government pledged to transfer hundreds of child refugees from Greece, the first unaccompanied minor from the country will arrive in London this week. However the 15-year-old Syrian is described by experts as profoundly traumatised because of the delay and has recently attempted to take his own life. Fourteen months have elapsed since the boy was first identified by the Home Office as especially vulnerable and eligible for immediate transfer. It has also emerged that Hammersmith and Fulham council in west London told the Home Office a year ago that it had a place for the teenager, but officials did not act on the offer – a decision that charities say has caused “irreversible damage” to the child, who has lost contact with his family in Syria. Giannoula Kefala, the council’s principal social worker, said: “From my perspective, the impasse and likely irreversible harm already caused to this extremely vulnerable child is unbearably disturbing.” Kefala said that last December she informed the Home Office of her intention to travel to Greece to assess the boy. “It is absolutely clear from my visit that the long delay has caused this child terrible harm, and that it has been apparent for a long time that the available resources in Greece cannot cater for this child’s needs. Recent hospital records make clear that the ongoing uncertainty is having a devastating impact.” The teenager is currently on heavy psychiatric medication, which worries his doctor but which is believed to be necessary to prevent a fatal outcome. Until last Monday the youngster was being detained in a police cell with no access to medical professionals, and forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor. On 22 October, police said the boy, after repeated self-harming, had made a suicide attempt and was at “imminent risk of killing himself”. Kefala said she was concerned the boy could die. The child’s imminent transfer is expected to precipitate a handful of similarly urgent cases. Almost 300 unaccompanied minors in Greece were identified last year as being eligible to be moved to the UK under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act, which was passed in April 2016 following a campaign to bring 3,000 lone refugee children stuck in camps to Britain. Yet controversial changes introduced by the Home Office in March reduced the number of those eligible to come to the UK to about 40, excluding many who had previously been told they would be given sanctuary. As a result, only four eligible child refugees have been identified in Greece since April, despite data showing 9,700 unaccompanied children had entered this year, most having fled Syria. As frustration has mounted over the total failure to transfer child refugees from Greece, charities say they have repeatedly asked the Home Office for clarity over how the Dubs amendment is being implemented, along with its selection procedures and timeframe. Antonia Moustaka, a lawyer for the humanitarian agency Praksis, said: “Many children on the Dubs list have run away, having lost hope after long-promised transfers never materialised.” The youngster who is due to reach London this week was identified as a Dubs candidate in August 2016 because of his vulnerability, although Praksis only very recently learned that he was finally being transferred. During his detention in Greece, the child has spent more than 380 days in psychiatric clinics, 124 days in shelters for unaccompanied minors, and six weeks in police detention. One reason why his transfer is imperative is that there is no specialised facility in Greece to care for refugee children facing severe mental health issues. Conditions for unaccompanied minors have been condemned by Human Rights Watch, which found filthy cells infested with bugs and vermin, sometimes without mattresses or access to showers. Charities have accused the Home Office of being more preoccupied with public relations than facilitating the boy’s transfer, questioning the effectiveness of an official deployed to Greece last year with the aim of facilitating Dubs. Natasha Tsangarides, senior field manager for the charity Safe Passage, which is working alongside the UK government to relocate child refugees, said: “It is devastating that this child has reached absolute breaking point, facing a real risk of death, and has still not been transferred.” Despite the youngster’s current condition, Kefala remained optimistic that the child, once in the UK, could improve. “He’s a very intelligent child in desperate need of affection, and he has deeply moved everyone who has met him. I share their optimism that, with suitable care and therapeutic arrangements, the boy’s impressive skills and coping mechanisms can be tapped to provide him the chance to lead a healthier and dignified life that every child deserves.” Aside from the situation in Greece, 11,186 unaccompanied minors are known to be in France along with 13,867 in Italy, most of whom arrived by sea from north Africa. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely. “We are working closely with the Greek authorities and the UNHCR to put in place processes for identifying and transferring unaccompanied children from Greece under section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 and the Dublin Regulation.”"
2017-12-23T13:58:00Z,The invisible wall: how Trump is slowing immigration without laying a brick,"Donald Trump has failed to add another inch to the country’s border wall between the US and Mexico, but his administration this year has quietly erected a steep, invisible wall that limits migration to the US, according to interviews with lawyers and refugee groups. Some of these roadblocks received considerable attention, like the three versions of a travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries and the cancellation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) – an Obama-era program that protected undocumented youth raised in the US. But the Trump administration also appears to have orchestrated a more subtle attack on immigration that touches the most vulnerable populations, like refugees, as well as powerful business people who work in the US. “I think that they’re basically hoping that five years from now we see a significant decrease in the number of people who even want to come,” Sandra Feist, an immigration lawyer in Minnesota, told the Guardian. “I think if we keep this up, that’s what we’ll see.” Feist, who has worked in immigration law for 16 years and is a part of the American Immigration Lawyers Association media and advocacy committee, said a slew of small administrative changes have drastically slowed the visa process. This includes things such as increased scrutiny of the H-1B visa for people in specialty occupations and a new requirement that people seeking employer-sponsored green cards be interviewed. For all visas, immigration lawyers have also seen an increase in challenges, or requests for evidence, from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees immigration. When Trump was elected, Feist anticipated Congress would move to change immigration law, but she said she did not expect interference with the administrative process. “I don’t think I expected them to attack my high-skilled immigration process so aggressively,” Feist said. “I also was not prepared for the ways in which they used the administrative processes so skillfully to create very real hurdles and barriers in ways that didn’t require any changes in the law.” A concern for immigration lawyers is the direction of the USCIS under its new ombudsman, Julie Kirchner, who for 10 years was director of Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that has advocated extreme restrictions on immigration. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) called for her removal in May. “We do not believe that a person who has spent over a decade attacking immigrant communities will now work effectively and thoughtfully to advance the rights of immigrants and fulfill the important duties that are required of this role,” the CHC said. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on congressional correspondence to secretaries. The changes at USCIS have hit the key pillars of immigration in the US: employer and family-based, where citizens or a green card holder sponsor a family member’s green card application. Trump has said he wants to replace family-based immigration, which he calls chain migration, with a merit-based system. Trump has also called for Congress to terminate the diversity lottery program, which awards 50,000 visas to people vetted by the same process as other visas. “The lottery system and chain migration – we are going to end them fast. Congress must get involved immediately, and they are involved immediately, and I can tell you we have tremendous support, they will be ended,” Trump said last week. In the meantime, programs to help people fleeing natural disasters, violence and persecution have either been cancelled or slowed by bureaucratic hurdles under Trump. In July, advocates filed a lawsuit that accused DHS and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of putting asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border in grave danger by threatening, misleading or rejecting them. The agencies do not comment publicly on litigation. Trump appointees have also dramatically shifted how the federal government speaks about asylum, going as far as to suggest in public communications the unproven claim that asylum is a routinely abused legal loophole. “We also have dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum providing them with the magic words needed to trigger the credible fear process,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in October. USCIS said it does not have data that shows widespread abuse of the asylum system. The Department of Justice, which Session heads, directed the Guardian to five press releases and one news story about immigration fraud. None of these cases demonstrated abuse of the asylum system – though a Bosnian was found to have lied about his involvement in the country’s civil war in order to obtain refugee status. Three of the fraud schemes were orchestrated fully, or in part, by Americans. This year, the administration has also gone after a program that grants temporary status to people affected by events like natural disasters or conflict: Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In November, TPS was terminated for more than 50,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans who must leave by 2019 or face deportation. The largest group of (TPS) recipients, Salvadorans who fled their home country after it was struck by earthquakes in 2001, are waiting to hear whether their protection will be extended before it expires in January. And the White House made refugees one if its primary targets a week after Trump took office, when he issued an executive order blocking refugees from entry in the first travel ban. In September, the White House restricted refugee admissions in 2018 to 45,000 people – the lowest ceiling since the president began capping refugee admissions in 1980. Unlike the smaller administrative changes to immigration processing being made in federal agencies, the travel ban was easily challenged in courts and deemed unconstitutional. The supreme court, however, allowed the third version of the travel ban to be enforced this month while it faces multiple legal challenges. This version does not block refugees, but does bar most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, Venezuela and North Korea from entering the US. Hans Van de Weerd, vice-president of US programs at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said US efforts to restrict refugee admissions signals to other countries that it is OK to kick out refugees. “It makes the global challenge of offering protection to refugees so much bigger,” Van de Weerd told the Guardian. The Trump administration has also suspended refugee programs such as the Central American Minors program, which allowed parents lawfully in the US to bring their minor children to the country – IRC estimated the program protected nearly 2,700 people last year. And administrative hurdles like expanded security checks and paperwork requirements have put a further burden on an already slow system where cases can take up to 200 days to clear. “The country’s reputation as a beacon of safety and the values of this nation are really about offering protection to those who are in danger,” said Van de Weerd. “The US is losing that reputation.” Despite the piling of bricks in the virtual wall, Van de Weerd said IRC remained hopeful because the administration’s efforts inspired support for groups that help immigrants and refugees. “We’ve seen a massive interest from the private sector in resettlement and an increase in private donors,” said Van der Weerd. “We see businesses standing up and saying we want to employ people. We’ve had a hard time managing the huge inflows of volunteers.” He wasn’t sure if the energy would turn the tide, but it gave him hope as IRC prepares to push for more resettlements and improve the attitude towards refugees next year. Van der Weed said: “This whole situation has forced people to make clear where they stand.”"
2017-11-07T17:00:21Z,Appeals tribunal cases increase 600% and flood 'coming down the pipeline',"The tribunal that allows refugees, veterans and welfare recipients to challenge government decisions has been burdened by a vast increase to its workload, new figures show. The administrative appeals tribunal is an important part of the federal justice system, allowing the most vulnerable to challenge administrative decisions made by government. That includes migrants and refugees who have had a visa denied or cancelled, welfare security recipients who have been issued a debt, or veterans who have been ruled ineligible for support. A total of 6,581 matters were lodged with the AAT in 2014-15, which increased 600% to 41,432 in 2015-16, largely as a result of its amalgamation with several other tribunals. But the increase to its workload continued last financial year. It had 51,426 matters lodged in 2016-17, an increase of 24%. The number of cases finalised and still ongoing also increased by significant amounts. One tribunal source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the increase in workload had not been accompanied by increases to resources. The source warned the new caseload, when matters began to reach hearing, would place a significant burden on the tribunal. “It usually takes even with accelerated matters, six to nine months to take matters into a hearing,” the source said. “So we haven’t had too many of them in hearings before the tribunal yet. “But the flood is coming down the pipeline, as it were.” The growth is largely driven by migration and refugee cases, which account for 52% of the total cases lodged last financial year and 71% of the matters on hand. Ben Lumsdaine, a solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said delays in the tribunal were worsening and had stretched out beyond six to nine months for a hearing. “A lot of the matters for our clients have taken a lot longer than that,” he said. “It is quite variable but it’s not unusual for it to take longer than that. “It seems like the waiting time has been increasing.” Appeals against national disability insurance scheme decisions have also quadrupled in a year, placing additional weight on Australia’s already overloaded administrative appeals tribunal system. The number of appeals against NDIS decisions rose from 46 in 2015-16 to 186 the following year, according to the national disability agency’s annual report. The AAT cases largely relate to decisions to deny access or not fund certain support services for people with a disability. The increase in appeals is explained by the rapid rise in the number of NDIS participants, from 30,281 in 2015-16 to 90,638 the next year. “As the number of NDIS participants increases, it is not unreasonable to also expect growth in related activities,” a National Disability Insurance Agency spokeswoman said. “These activities include new access and planning decisions, routine scheduled reviews, as well as complaints and/or appeals. As the roll out of the NDIS progresses, the NDIA will continue to put the best outcomes for participants at the core of our decision-making.” NDIS cases are a fraction of the tribunal’s workload. But the tribunal source said the NDIA often fails to invest enough resources into running its cases, making them more difficult to deal with. “We’ve had a disproportionately large number of [NDIS] appeals to the tribunal,” the source said. “And they show every sign of not coping very well with the influx in applications for support. “On a number of occasions, to be frank, the NDIA has not adequately resourced themselves for the matters that have come before the tribunal. They’ve been all over the shop.”"
2017-11-18T22:00:43Z,First child refugee from Greek camps comes to UK,"More than a year after the UK government pledged to transfer hundreds of child refugees from Greece, the first unaccompanied minor from the country will arrive in London this week. However the 15-year-old Syrian is described by experts as profoundly traumatised because of the delay and has recently attempted to take his own life. Fourteen months have elapsed since the boy was first identified by the Home Office as especially vulnerable and eligible for immediate transfer. It has also emerged that Hammersmith and Fulham council in west London told the Home Office a year ago that it had a place for the teenager, but officials did not act on the offer – a decision that charities say has caused “irreversible damage” to the child, who has lost contact with his family in Syria. Giannoula Kefala, the council’s principal social worker, said: “From my perspective, the impasse and likely irreversible harm already caused to this extremely vulnerable child is unbearably disturbing.” Kefala said that last December she informed the Home Office of her intention to travel to Greece to assess the boy. “It is absolutely clear from my visit that the long delay has caused this child terrible harm, and that it has been apparent for a long time that the available resources in Greece cannot cater for this child’s needs. Recent hospital records make clear that the ongoing uncertainty is having a devastating impact.” The teenager is currently on heavy psychiatric medication, which worries his doctor but which is believed to be necessary to prevent a fatal outcome. Until last Monday the youngster was being detained in a police cell with no access to medical professionals, and forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor. On 22 October, police said the boy, after repeated self-harming, had made a suicide attempt and was at “imminent risk of killing himself”. Kefala said she was concerned the boy could die. The child’s imminent transfer is expected to precipitate a handful of similarly urgent cases. Almost 300 unaccompanied minors in Greece were identified last year as being eligible to be moved to the UK under the Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act, which was passed in April 2016 following a campaign to bring 3,000 lone refugee children stuck in camps to Britain. Yet controversial changes introduced by the Home Office in March reduced the number of those eligible to come to the UK to about 40, excluding many who had previously been told they would be given sanctuary. As a result, only four eligible child refugees have been identified in Greece since April, despite data showing 9,700 unaccompanied children had entered this year, most having fled Syria. As frustration has mounted over the total failure to transfer child refugees from Greece, charities say they have repeatedly asked the Home Office for clarity over how the Dubs amendment is being implemented, along with its selection procedures and timeframe. Antonia Moustaka, a lawyer for the humanitarian agency Praksis, said: “Many children on the Dubs list have run away, having lost hope after long-promised transfers never materialised.” The youngster who is due to reach London this week was identified as a Dubs candidate in August 2016 because of his vulnerability, although Praksis only very recently learned that he was finally being transferred. During his detention in Greece, the child has spent more than 380 days in psychiatric clinics, 124 days in shelters for unaccompanied minors, and six weeks in police detention. One reason why his transfer is imperative is that there is no specialised facility in Greece to care for refugee children facing severe mental health issues. Conditions for unaccompanied minors have been condemned by Human Rights Watch, which found filthy cells infested with bugs and vermin, sometimes without mattresses or access to showers. Charities have accused the Home Office of being more preoccupied with public relations than facilitating the boy’s transfer, questioning the effectiveness of an official deployed to Greece last year with the aim of facilitating Dubs. Natasha Tsangarides, senior field manager for the charity Safe Passage, which is working alongside the UK government to relocate child refugees, said: “It is devastating that this child has reached absolute breaking point, facing a real risk of death, and has still not been transferred.” Despite the youngster’s current condition, Kefala remained optimistic that the child, once in the UK, could improve. “He’s a very intelligent child in desperate need of affection, and he has deeply moved everyone who has met him. I share their optimism that, with suitable care and therapeutic arrangements, the boy’s impressive skills and coping mechanisms can be tapped to provide him the chance to lead a healthier and dignified life that every child deserves.” Aside from the situation in Greece, 11,186 unaccompanied minors are known to be in France along with 13,867 in Italy, most of whom arrived by sea from north Africa. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We remain committed to transferring 480 children from Europe to the UK under section 67 of the Immigration Act. We have accepted further referrals this year and transfers are ongoing. We will continue to work closely with EU partners and local authorities to transfer eligible children here quickly and safely. “We are working closely with the Greek authorities and the UNHCR to put in place processes for identifying and transferring unaccompanied children from Greece under section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 and the Dublin Regulation.”"
2017-12-19T12:01:33Z,Asylum seekers record festive single to raise awareness of refugees' plight,"They escaped persecution, violence and torture in some of the most brutal countries in the world. Now, a group of asylum seekers have come together with professional musicians to record a single for the festive season, an uplifting rendition of Bill Withers’ Lean On Me. The One Heart Refugee Choir, made up of 24 refugees from countries including Zimbabwe, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Jamaica and Kazakhstan, decided to record the track as a symbol of the resilience of the human spirit, and to offer a message of solidarity. Tamara McFarlane, one of the singers in the choir, said: “Refugees’ and asylum seekers’ voices are rarely heard in this country. “Usually we are hidden. We have all been through terrible things, but our spirits are strong. We hope that the song’s message, urging human beings to unite, is one that people across the UK can get behind.” Less than 1% of the world’s 2.2 million refugees make it to the UK to claim asylum, yet those who do often struggle to overcome the stigma placed on asylum seekers and experience social and institutional hostility. As a Guardian video revealed, they often live in filthy, overcrowded and dangerous conditions in Home Office accommodation. Those in the One Heart choir have escaped rape, torture and forced female genital mutilation. One of the singers had to flee Zimbabwe for resisting Robert Mugabe’s regime, while another from South Africa was subjected to “corrective rape” after it was found she was a lesbian. The choir said the song gave them an opportunity to present an antidote to the negative associations often placed on asylum seekers. Lean On Me was originally written by Withers in 1972 as a testament to the power of community spirit that he had known growing up in a poor coalmining town in West Virginia. One of the professional singers involved in the collaboration, Nina Miranda of the band Smoke City, said she had encouraged fellow musicians to get involved because “the message of human solidarity, especially in times of adversity, has never been more important”. “Everyone had a wonderful day recording the song and it was a real pleasure to perform with the talented members of the One Heart choir. We hope the song will raise awareness and funds for asylum seekers and refugees,” she said. The song is also being used to raise awareness and funds to help refugees. Proceeds will go to Refugee Action and donations can be made here."
2017-10-19T05:32:29Z,Thursday briefing: plight of Calais child refugees revealed,"Top story: one year on, still in limbo Hello and good morning, Graham Russell here bringing you the news of the day. A year after the gesture that brought unaccompanied asylum-seeker children from Calais to the UK, many remain in limbo and face precarious living conditions after a disastrous lack of planning by the UK government. Many are still waiting to hear if they can even stay in the country, something lawyers and charities say is causing huge distress and is reflective of wider failures that see some applicants homeless or sleeping on floors. “On 9 December we had 20 young people arrive into Manchester airport. We had no notice,” said solicitor Kate Ormsby. “The Home Office did nothing [to prepare social services] and social workers were taken by surprise. They had no idea what was going on, what their obligations were.” Lord Dubs, the Labour peer whose legislative amendment paved the way for the new arrivals in the autumn of 2016, told the Guardian there was no excuse for the treatment of the minors. “It’s just awful, they have had so much uncertainty, any more uncertainty is so wrong,” he said. There have also been concerns about children who came under EU Dublin regulations, which allow for family members to be reunited. People working with these young people say some were placed with family members they barely knew or hadn’t seen for years. * * * Wing and a prayer – The world’s insect population has fallen 75% in the past 27 years, leading one shocked UK scientist to warn: “We are currently on course for ecological Armageddon.” Insects make up two-thirds of life on Earth and play a vital role as both pollinators and prey. The findings were based on research gathered in nature reserves, making the results even more worrying. The cause of the huge decline is unclear, but destruction of wild areas and widespread use of pesticides are the most likely factors. * * * FA racism fallout – Senior figures at the Football Association are facing calls to resign over their failings in the Mark Sampson racism affair and the behaviour of its chief executive, Martin Glenn, which one England Women’s player said was “bordering on blackmail”. Damian Collins called for the four FA executives who appeared in front of MPs on Wednesday to stand down, citing “serious failings”. Earlier, player Eni Aluko said Glenn threatened to withhold money from an £80,000 out-of-court settlement the FA had reached with her unless she made a statement saying the organisation was not institutionally racist. Glenn denied trying to strike a deal. * * * Don’t chip and run – Theresa May will urge EU citizens living in the UK to stay after Brexit, saying there is no intention to use them “as bargaining chips” in negotiations. The PM is to send an email to 100,000 EU citizens who signed up for updates saying: “I couldn’t be clearer: EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay.” May heads to Brussels today for a crucial EU summit on whether the Brexit negotiations have made enough progress to start trade talks. Diplomatic sources say they haven’t but that they’ll be nice about it. * * * Unity, or else – We should find out in a few hours whether Spain’s prime minister will go through with his threat to impose direct rule from Madrid over Catalonia. Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, had until Thursday to abandon his secession plans or he would try out invoking article 155 of the constitution. Read this to find out more about what could happen. * * * Self-harm – Instances of girls aged 13-16 self-harming rose 68% in just three years, a study of data from 674 GP practices across the UK has found. The figures, which chime with separate NHS data, also revealed it to be more common in deprived areas. Youngsters who self-harmed were found to be about 17 times more likely to die from suicide, and 34 times more likely to die from acute alcohol or drug poisoning. * * * Performance-enhancing dogs – Alaska’s famous 1,000-mile sled dog race has become mired in a drugs scandal after several animals tested positive for the opioid pain reliever Tramadol. It is the first time a banned substance has been detected since the Iditarod began testing sled dogs in 1994. But the offending musher’s identity remains a secret. Aaron Burmeister, an Iditarod board member and musher, said: “This is an isolated incident.” * * * Lunchtime read: ‘There has been a takedown of the rule of law here’ “This wasn’t an aberration. It was a culmination,” says Matthew Caruana Galizia, son of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed on Monday afternoon in an explosion so powerful it blew her car off the road into the field. Much of her – and Matthew’s – work since last year has focused on revelations arising from the Panama Papers, but long before then, Daphne was being relentlessly harassed and intimidated. Sitting in the family home just a few hundred yards from the crime scene, the brothers recall dogs killed, arson attempts, daily death threats. Matthew’s brother Andrew adds: “These things don’t happen by accident. This state of affairs was cultivated. If a journalist dies, it’s because people are not doing the job they’re supposed to do.” Sport That FA chairman, Greg Clarke, had to promise Eni Aluko that their promised next meeting would “all be above board” shows the miserable mess the racism saga has become, writes Martha Kelner. Antonio Conte has reacted angrily to José Mourinho’s observation that “other managers cry and cry and cry” about injuries to their players, after Eden Hazard’s double earned Chelsea a draw with Roma in the Champions League. In Lisbon, Marcus Rashford preyed on an error from the Benfica goalkeeper to give Manchester United a 1-0 win while Celtic were were thrashed 3-0 by a rampant Bayern Munich. Greig Laidlaw is the latest high-profile player from the home nations to be ruled out of the autumn internationals through injury. Johanna Konta has split with her coach, Wim Fissette, ending a successful partnership that seems to have unravelled since she made the Wimbledon semi-finals in June. And Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney has said she was sexually abused by her USA Gymnastics doctor from the age of 13 until her retirement last year. Business Britain’s low-pay culture traps people where they are and prevents them getting into full-time work with better pay, according to a major social mobility study. Most remained stuck in a cycle of part-time and insecure jobs, it said. And Jon Henley has been speaking to the creative industry leaders who fear Brexit will ruin their major advantage: easy access to the very best talent. The pound is buying $1.321 and €1.119. The papers Feels strangely like a Monday, with each paper going its own way, and three exclusives claimed. We start with the FT, which carries a frightening warning from the Financial Conduct Authority about the growing wealth gap between young and old. Millions of people, usually between 25 and 34, are “in serious financial difficulty” and have not been able to pay the bills in three or more of the previous six months, it says. The Guardian focuses on the FA racism and blackmail row, plus a hefty chunk about the ecological Armageddon. The Independent has a Grenfell tower story, which says police told the council to block the release of correspondence about fire safety before the disaster. The Mail goes with the intriguing headline of “Dial 555 for bank fraud’. It says ministers and police are considering setting up a hotline that experts hope will add urgency to efforts to stop scams. The Times crams three stories up front: universities must enshrine free speech or face sanction, says minister Jo Johnson, the EU is trying to add £6bn to the Brexit divorce bill and the kidnapping of four British missionaries in Nigeria. The Telegraph ramps up the anticipation in Brussels with the headline: “May urged to walk out if EU won’t talk trade” next to a picture story about a navy “Top Gun” pilot who is having trouble getting his American wife into the country. The Express reaches to Saturday to warn of a fresh post-Ophelia weather bomb, helpfully getting the phrase “explosive cyclogenesis” onto its front page. The Mirror carries the lone cheery story of the day: Max Johnson, the nine-year-old who championed the paper’s campaign to change donor laws, has promised to look after his brand new heart. It carries a big picture of Max bearing his sizeable scar but looking happy. The Sun goes with the eight-year-old story about Jenson Button confronting Richard Branson over his behaviour towards then girlfriend Jessica Michibata at a restaurant.

2017-11-23T06:26:35Z,Refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani released after arrest on Manus,"Papua New Guinea’s paramilitary police officers detained and then released refugee and journalist Behrouz Boochani during a raid on the Manus Island detention centre. On Thursday morning PNG police, the paramilitary Mobile Squad and immigration officers entered the centre to force out the remaining hundreds of refugees who for more than three weeks have camped in deteriorating conditions. Refugees reported that about 40 men had been forced on to buses, presumably heading to the transit accommodation. There were several reports of buses carrying refugees leaving the centre and at least three arriving at one of the alternative accommodation sites. The men have refused to leave the facility – which formally closed at the end of last month – because of their safety fears in the town of Lorengau. It was not clear on Thursday afternoon where Boochani had been taken, or whether he had been charged. Manus Island police officials could not be reached. Boochani has been one of the most prominent of the group, reporting for the Guardian and a number of other publications around the world on the conditions inside the centre. On Thursday afternoon several refugees confirmed Boochani had been taken away from the camp by members of the Mobile Squad. Pictures of the event showed him being led away, flanked by officers. Boochani had been reporting from a hiding place in the toilets while officers confiscated phones and destroyed the belongings of refugees. However, according to witnesses, officers specifically searched for him and others reporting events to the outside world. Amnesty International said it wasn’t clear why Boochani had been arrested but it appeared to be “a deliberate attempt to isolate human rights activists from the wider group”. “The arrest of Behrouz Boochani as a so-called ringleader of the peaceful protest on Manus Island is deeply misguided,” said Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International’s Pacific researcher. “It violates his rights and sends a terrible signal about PNG’s intentions with regard to the remaining 400-plus men. He must be immediately and unconditionally released from police custody.” Australia’s Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance union said if Boochani had been targeted because of his reporting then it was “an egregious attack on press freedom”. “His reporting in the finest traditions of journalism has been critical when the Australian and PNG governments have done everything they can to prevent media from having access to the asylum seekers on Manus Island,” said the MEAA chief executive, Paul Murphy. “We call on the Australian and PNG governments to release him from custody, assure his safety, and not to hinder him from continuing to perform his role as a journalist.” The International Federation of Journalists joined the MEAA’s calls. “The arrest of Behrouz Boochani, if it is because of his work as journalist, is a blatant attack of press freedom and an attempt to silence a critical voice,” it said. “Journalists should never be stopped from doing their work.” Boochani tweeted late in the day that he had been released after being held for more than two hours near the camp. A source on Manus Island said Boochani had not been charged with any offence. Boochani wrote that he had been kept handcuffed while in custody and had his belongings broken. This month Boochani was awarded an Amnesty International Australia media award for his body of journalistic work reporting from Manus. The award’s judges said his work “delivered under very difficult circumstances, is powerful, courageous and extraordinary. Its currency, its emotion, its credibility all combine to make it really special”. Boochani, an ethnic Kurd from Ilam city in the west of Iran, bordering Iraq, was a freelance journalist in his homeland, and began his career writing for the student newspaper at Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran where he studied geopolitics. He wrote for several newspapers in Iran, including the Kurdish language magazine Werya. Boochani spent several years under surveillance because of Werya’s promotion of Kurdish language, culture and politics. His membership of the Kurdish Democratic party, outlawed in Iran, and the National Union of Kurdish Students, brought him even closer attention. In 2011, Boochani was arrested and interrogated by Iran’s Sepah – the country’s paramilitary intelligence agency. In 2013, Werya’s offices were raided and his colleagues arrested. Escaping arrest, Boochani fled the country."
2017-06-19T12:10:47Z,Sabha in the spotlight: the city where migrants are sold as slaves,"Deep in the Libyan desert at the confluence of several migration routes from sub-Saharan Africa, this oasis city of 130,000 hit the headlines earlier this year. The United Nations migration agency reported that some new arrivals at this staging post to Tripoli and the Mediterranean coast, 400 miles north, were being “sold” at modern day slave auctions. It’s a worrying development for Sabha – always liable to become involved in the modern refugee crisis by its position – and World Refugee Day 20 June serves as a reminder of how vulnerable migrants are in places like this semi-lawless enclave, caught between tribal and political factions in post-revolution Libya. At least half of the 180,000 migrants who arrived in Italy via Libya last year passed through Sabha. “The majority of west African migrants come through Agadez in Niger, then through Qatroun. And the east Africans come up from the border with Chad,” explains Ashraf Hassan, at the UN’s International Organisation for Migration. Then through people-smugglers migrants negotiate further passage north – or not, if the slavery allegations are true. “Sabha is not the place that drives the people-smuggling... it’s just the initial assembly point,” explains Ashraf Hassan, at the UN’s International Organisation for Migration. Currently the local municipality are too under-resourced to regulate the situation. For the situation to improve in favour of empowering migrants rather than smugglers requires a complete change in Libyan fortunes, adds Hassan: “The country in general needs to be stabilised before Sabha can support the integration of migrants.” The city in numbers … 8 – millimetres of annual rainfall in the city 365 – average cost in dollars for a migrant to reach Tripoli 10 – dinar denomination of the banknote on which the city’s Italian colonial fort is featured 12 – tonnes of thrust delivered by the West German Otrag rocket tested near Sabha in 1981 150,000 – estimated km2 of the prehistoric mega-lake of which the Sabha oasis was once part … and pictures Few images are available on social media from the city, but this photo from the archives shows a unidentified biker riding between Sabha and Waw el Kebir in the Paris-Dakar-Cairo rally in 2000. Sabha in sound and vision Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was said to be politicised at secondary school in Sabha, and looked to the south as his hold on Tripoli slipped in the middle of 2011. Here’s a speech he gave in the city. And this is CNN’s through-the-keyhole tour of Gaddafi’s Sabha bolthole – “recently redecorated by Nato” – in September 2011. History in 100 words The current trade in human beings is simply a grim evolution of the trans-Saharan networks that criss-crossed the Fezzan region (of which Sabha is capital) for centuries, maybe millennia. The city was once an oasis stop-off for Tubu traders running salt and Hajj pilgrims across the desert; now it’s bootleg petrol and economic migrants. Italy left behind Fort Elena in their efforts to pacify the Fezzan in the 1910s; the French seized it in 1943 and further developed the environs, still only occupied by a few thousand people in the 1960s. The Jamahiriya announced by Gaddafi in Sabha in 1977 launched an ambitious programme of rural renewal in the Fezzan that, coupled with the 70s oil boom, ensured that the city continued to grow as an administrative centre. By the 90s the low-rise sprawl around the oasis was Libya’s gateway for Saharan trade, swelled by refugees from the Tuareg uprising in Niger and Tubu exiles from conflict in Chad. What’s everybody talking about? The monkey, owned by a shopkeeper of the Gaddadfa tribe, that sparked four days of tribal clashes last November after snatching a headscarf from a schoolgirl. The aftermath saw the girl’s Awlad Suleiman retaliate against the former strongman’s faction in clashes involving tanks and mortar in which 16 died and 50 were wounded. Post-revolution Sabha remains heavily divided since fighting broke out between the Awlad Suleiman and Tubu tribe in 2012 – possibly sparked by suspicions that the Tubu minority were planning to take over the town. “This Saharan crossroads used to be very different, says Hassan, who lived there prior to 2014: “Sabha was a melting pot. A spot where Arabs and sub-Saharan Africans were living together. You see the Sudanese, you see the Chadians, you see the Nigerians, you see the Libyan Arabs, the Libyan Tubus. I am from Sudan, so when I went to Tripoli I didn’t feel like I was welcome. But in Sabha, I felt like I was welcome.” What’s next for the city? The economic development of Sabha and the hinterlands rests on re-establishing air links with the north, says Hassan: “When the roads aren’t safe, you need an airport.” The main international airport has been closed since 2014 due to the local security situation. The nearby Tamanhent airport, a military airbase 30km to the north-east, opened for commercial flights last year, but is currently out of action following its seizure last month by the rebel Libyan National Army. The IOM have tried to put in place initiatives to stimulate the agricultural and trade economy in Sabha and Qatroun and prevent exploitation of migrants. But there is no chance of serious business development without solid transport links to the northern ports.

2017-08-23T04:00:04Z,‘We would rather die than stay there’: the refugees crossing from Morocco to Spain,"On the hilltops of Tarifa, the Spanish city that faces Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar and mainland Europe’s southernmost point, gusts of wind power the turbines dotting the landscape. For the surfers who pack the city’s hotels, the wind is a welcome sign of challenging waves. But for the Spanish coastguard and NGOs, the gusts are a warning that the record numbers of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the 10-mile strait are in grave danger. The number of refugees and migrants risking the sea journey between Morocco and Spain has been rising sharply, and last week was an exceptionally busy one for rescuers. On Wednesday, Salvamento Marítimom, Spain’s maritime safety and rescue agency, together with the Spanish Red Cross rescued nearly 600 people from at least 15 different vessels off the coast of Tarifa – the largest figure for a single day since August 2014, when about 1,300 people landed on the Spanish coast in a 24-hour period. Most attempt the crossing using paddle boats, but others use jetskis, inflatable vessels and rickety fishing boats. According to Frontex, the EU’s border agency, more migrants are dying at sea this year than in 2016. And most who continue to cross know the risks they are taking. “We prefer to die than to stay there. Death happens once but we prefer to risk our life than stay there,” said Abdou, 29, of the ethnic Amazigh community in the impoverished northern Rif region of Morocco, where hundreds of people have been arrested after recent protests against the state. He was rescued last week along with seven others from an inflatable Zodiac boat they had bought for €4,000 – a cheaper option that avoids the need to pay people-smugglers for passage. Zakaria, 30, said he was saved by a helicopter last week after coastguards spotted him and others attempting to cross the choppy waters in another Zodiac boat. “I was afraid. If the helicopter didn’t come we would have died,” he said. Recent clampdowns on routes to Europe via Libya have led to the increase in attempts to reach the continent via Morocco. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said the number of people arriving in Spain by sea this year is likely to outnumber the number arriving in Greece. According to IOM, 11,849 irregular migrants and refugees reached Spain by sea between 1 January and mid-August. A further 3,500 have made it to two Spanish enclaves in north Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, the only EU land borders with Africa. Though Spain’s numbers are dwarfed by those of Italy, which has seen 97,376 arrivals so far this year, there is significant pressure on Spanish authorities to make sure it can protect, register and accommodate those arriving on its shores. Concerns are also growing over the potential for militants to exploit migrant routes into Europe in the wake of terror attacks in Nice, Brussels and most recently Barcelona – all claimed by Islamic State. Rosa Otero, of the UN’s refugee agency in Spain, said the country was not yet in an emergency situation, particularly when compared with Italy, but authorities were struggling to cope. “Given the current rise … there are no adequate structures and procedures in place to deal with more arrivals and to swiftly identify international protection and other protection needs,” she said, adding that the shortcomings left migrants – especially children – vulnerable to traffickers. Every day, between three to four dark green buses marked Guardia Civil arrive in Tarifa to transfer new arrivals to the nearby city of Algeciras, where the Centro de Internamiento de Extranjeros (the alien internment centre) is located. Most arrivals are originally from the west African countries of Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast. The Red Cross, one of many NGOs active in Algeciras, provides asylum seekers with food three times a day and a place to sleep. On Saturday the centre’s rooms were packed with children using computers. Women washed clothes outside. Abdou was one of the men being housed at the Red Cross facility. He said the thought of the trip across the Strait of Gibraltar had frightened him, but he had been determined to make it. “What is important is that I’ve left Morocco, nothing else is important. We had a lot of fear, because the sea was sometimes peaceful, sometimes not,” he said. “There’s war. The state of Morocco has conflict with [the Amazigh] people. It’s not like Syria but they put us in jail for political reason. There’s no right[s], no economy, nothing.” Two brothers, 28 and 19, and their two cousins, both 21, were among those rescued on Wednesday. Like Abdou, they too belong to the Amazigh community. Last month their city, al-Hoceima on the northern edge of the Rif mountains, was the scene of a million-man march. Moroccan security guards used batons and teargas to quell protesters. Human Rights Watch said at least 185 people had been arrested in connection with the protests and at least 46 of them had been sentenced to 18 months in jail after forced confessions. The four men made the six-hour, 105-mile journey from Plaga Soaan in el-Hoceima to Motril, on Spain’s south coast, on one jetski. They were kept in custody for two days upon their arrival before being taken to the Red Cross in Algeciras.Those seeking asylum in Spain can wait anything from six months to two years to receive a decision, and a growing backlog means the processing time is getting longer. Local police say local temporary detention centres are so overwhelmed by the number of asylum seekers that they are relying on NGOs to help find accommodation. Albert Bitoden Yaka, a centre coordinator at Fundación Cepaim in Algeciras, which shelters refugees and migrants in eight different houses in the city, agreed there was a lack of resources to deal with the new arrivals. “In my opinion, I think the authorities and European states are proving to be inefficient when it comes to addressing this phenomenon, especially the arrival of refugees,” he said. The Guardian visited one Fundación Cepaim house on Saturday, where seven refugees were sheltered in four rooms in a flat in a large residential block. Residents receive monthly payments of €50 to spend as they wish and €170 for food, until Spanish authorities reach a decision on their asylum application. “Algeciras is a city of more than 120 nationalities, they know how important it is to live together. It is in moments of like this [after the Barcelona attack] that we realise the impact of having experience in diversity to prevent hostility,” Yaka said. Larri, a 22-year-old English-speaking refugee from Ghana, lives in a Cepaim house. He said he first tried to reach Europe via the Libya-Italy route, but nearly died when the boat carrying 35 people capsized an hour after their departure. “Only 12 people survived, the rest all died before our eyes, among them children and women,” he remembered. “I swam and caught the boat, until the next day fishermen came and saw us. They went back and brought help. We were crying, they went back, people came with a boat. I was in sea for one day until 11am.” Undeterred, Larri travelled to Morocco in an attempt to reach Spain across the strait. He said he belonged to Ghana’s Bimoba ethnic group, which is fighting a long-running conflict with the rival Konkomba group. He had left Ghana for Libya as soon as he finished junior high school, in search of a better life. “I didn’t know Libya was also fighting,” he said. He worked in Libya for three years before going to Morocco, where he paid 1,000 dinars (£82) to get on a dinghy with women and children. “In this weather, a lot of people die,” he said. “It’s up to God, some people don’t reach, some people reach. The moment you’re in the boat, you’re selling your life, but there’s no solution. [The] only solution [is to] pray God to save you, [to] reach the place, but it’s not easy to enter this sea.” Asked whether it was worth taking the risk, he said: “Here, it’s 100% better than Ghana. I was suffering, sometime beaten up on my way from Niger to Libya. When I see everything now that I’m in Europe, it was 100% worth taking the risk.”"
2017-12-21T19:00:32Z,Devastating climate change could lead to 1m migrants a year entering EU by 2100,"Climate change will drive a huge increase in the number of migrants seeking asylum in Europe if current trends continue, according to a new study. The number of migrants attempting to settle in Europe each year will triple by the end of the century based on current climate trends alone, independent of other political and economic factors, according to the research. Even if efforts to curb global warming are successful, the number of applications for asylum could rise by a quarter, the authors predict. Wolfram Schlenker, professor at the school of international and public affairs at Columbia University in New York, and lead author of the study, said: “Europe will see increasing numbers of desperate people fleeing their home countries.” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who was not involved with the report, told the Guardian the results should be taken seriously by policymakers, though current forecasting models frequently fail to take such factors into account. He said: “This study shows how Europe will be impacted by one of the most serious impacts of climate change. Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of people will be exposed to coastal sea level rise and shifts in extreme weather that will cause mass migrations away from the most vulnerable locations. We know from human history that such migrations often lead to conflict and war, with devastating consequences. The huge potential costs of migration-related conflict are usually omitted from economic models of climate change impacts in the future.” Climate change is predicted to result in more droughts, floods, heatwaves, and other extreme weather, as well as more intense storms and rising sea levels. These effects are likely to render agriculture more difficult, if not impossible, across swathes of the globe, including sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. These effects will also be felt in Europe, but its lower base temperatures, relative prosperity and advanced infrastructure mean the damage could be contained, and make it an attractive destination for migrants. Migration, or attempted migration, to Europe has increased markedly in the last decade, with leading causes including the war in Syria, turmoil in north Africa and the middle East, and a burgeoning young population with few economic prospects in many regions of Africa and the middle East. The new study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, was initiated and largely funded by the EU’s Joint Research Centre, with contribution from the US Department of Energy, and led by scientists at Columbia University in New York. The authors of the study examined asylum applications in the EU from 103 countries between 2000 and 2014, during which time applications averaged more than 350,000 a year. They compared the applications with information on environmental factors, such as temperature and weather, and adjusted the data for factors such as conflict and political turmoil. In doing so, they spotted a trend correlating weather and changes in the number of asylum applications. For instance, countries with average temperatures around 20C – the optimum for growing many crops – show a higher number of applications, while there are fewer asylum seekers from areas with cooler temperatures. The data showed that the more temperatures in a country’s key agricultural regions rose above 20C in the growing season, the more people left their homes for another country. They recorded increases in the number of migrants from hot places such as Iraq and Pakistan when temperatures rose. However, immigration from colder countries fell when temperatures rose towards 20C. The scientists posit that as the globe warms, the number of people seeking asylum in Europe will correspondingly rise. Warming of 2.6C to 4.8C, which climate experts say is likely unless stronger action is taken to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, would result in as many as 660,000 additional asylum seekers coming to Europe each year by 2100, according to the model. Linking migration to climate change is controversial. Although many scientists, and many studies, are clear that rising temperatures and extreme weather are likely to increase migration, it is difficult to separate this factor from the myriad other factors that drive people to flee their homes. A drought in Syria from 2006 to 2010 was posited, in a 2015 study, as a factor behind that country’s civil war, which broke out in 2011 and still rages. Immigration, especially in the wake of the financial crisis and recessions which crippled European economies a decade ago and whose effects are only now beginning to subside, has become one of the hottest political issues in Europe. It was cited as one of the biggest factors in the UK’s referendum on EU membership, and has played a major role in recent elections in Germany and France. Schlenker said a rise in migration owing to climate change could exacerbate political tensions further. “Europe is already conflicted about how many refugees to admit. Though poorer countries in hotter regions are most vulnerable to climate change, our findings highlight the extent to which countries are interlinked.” Solomon Hsiang, professor at Berkeley, University of California, and author of a previous study linking conflict and climate change, who was not involved with the current research, said the world must prepare. “We will need to build new institutions and systems to manage this steady flow of asylum-seekers. As we have seen from recent experience in Europe, there are tremendous costs, both for refugees and their hosts, when we are caught flat-footed.”"
2017-08-14T13:47:04Z,Three NGOs halt Mediterranean migrant rescues after Libyan hostility,"Three NGOs have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because of the increasingly hostile stance of the Libyan authorities and coastguard. Save the Children and Germany’s Sea Eye have joined Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) in halting operations because they feel their crews can no longer work safely in what Sea Eye called a “changed security situation in the western Mediterranean”. Libya has asserted its right to operate well beyond the territorial limit of 12 nautical miles, defending the move as necessary in order to control the rescue operations. Coastguard ships have repeatedly clashed with NGO vessels on the edge of Libyan waters, sometimes opening fire. The crew of a rescue ship belonging to the Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms reported last week that the Libyan coastguard had fired warning shots while the vessel was in international waters. The Libyan coastguard told the ship not to come “or we will shoot you”, the charity said. Marcella Kraay, a coordinator with MSF onboard Aquarius, a vessel chartered by the German-French charity SOS Méditerranée, told the Guardian: “Obviously these incidents are something that concern us. “Shooting in the air is actually a very common message of crowd control – it’s used to calm people down. What happened last week with Proactiva is not a big departure from the concerns we had before. We take this stuff very seriously in our security analysis.” But Kraay said the crew’s main concern was for people being sent back to “lawless, violent” Libya, and for those who remain trapped there. Migrants and refugees who have spent time in detention camps in Libya have reported appalling treatment including forced labour, beatings, torture and rape. “This is the real issue,” Kraay added, saying fewer boats had appeared to be leaving in the past couple of weeks and there was evidence that many were being turned back. “People in Libya are suffering immensely, their only way out is via the sea.” A Libyan coastguard official, Ayoub Qassem, said that in general, the country “does not reject the NGOs’ presence, but we do demand from them more cooperation with the state of Libya. They should show more respect to Libyan sovereignty”. Sea Eye said it had reached its decision “with a heavy heart”. In a statement on the group’s Facebook page, its founder, Michael Busch Heuer, said it would “leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean”, adding that Libya had made an “explicit threat” against NGOs operating around its coast. Save the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would stay in Malta until it received assurances from the Libyan authorities. “The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,” said the group’s operations director, Rob MacGillivray. Tensions have also been mounting for weeks between the aid groups, whose vessels have rescued nearly one-third of the 100,000 migrants who have landed in Italy this year, and the government of Italy, where public opinion is increasingly turning against migrants. The Italian navy is providing technical and operational assistance to Libya’s coastguard to increase its capacity to intercept migrant boats and return their passengers to Libya, while some politicians in Rome have suggested that certain NGOs may be actively facilitating people smuggling. Rome has drawn up a strict code of conduct for NGOs at sea and prosecutors in Sicily have begun investigations against some they suspect of colluding with people smugglers. The Italian foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, said Libya’s growing involvement was reducing people smuggling. In an interview in La Stampa on Sunday, Alfano said Rome aimed to avoid deaths at sea by “reducing departures” from Libya. The government’s policy was of “taking away criminal earnings from traffickers, because fewer persons departing mean the traffickers earn less”, to finance aid agencies working with refugees and migrants to “assure respect for human rights in Libyan camps”. The vast majority of refugees and migrants reaching Europe this year have landed in Italy, according to the International Organisation for Migration. At least 2,242 people are thought to have died this year attempting to cross the western and central Mediterranean."
2017-11-16T14:46:55Z,Refugee family 'overwhelmed' by support after St Helens firebombing,"A Syrian refugee family whose home in Merseyside was firebombed in the middle of the night are “overwhelmed and thankful” for the outpouring of support, a charity helping them has said. The family of five were forced to flee their home in St Helens when it was set alight as they slept in the early hours of Sunday, police said. The family – a pregnant woman, a man and their three children, aged two, three and five – suffered from smoke inhalation and had to be rescued from the property by neighbours. Detectives were investigating whether the arson attack was a hate crime, a spokesman for Merseyside police said on Thursday. The perpetrators have not yet been caught. The young family had been living in St Helens since January after arriving in the UK under the government’s Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme (VPRS). Barrie Grunewald, the leader of St Helens council, told the Guardian that the family had moved into a new home in the town on Thursday having been put up in a hotel since the attack. A spokeswoman for Refugee Action, the charity that has been supporting the family since they arrived in the UK, said on Thursday they were “really overwhelmed and thankful for the support” after being inundated by well-wishers when news of the attack emerged on Wednesday. She added that they were “a little bit anxious about all the attention it’s been receiving” but that they were being helped by Refugee Action support workers and housing officers from St Helens council. Grunewald said he was “sickened to hear of the disgusting attack on a Syrian family who have come to St Helens seeking protection after fleeing conflict in their home country”. He said he was encouraged by news that the local community had rallied round to help the family and make donations, as well as by the dozens of “heartfelt” comments on social media. Grunewald added: “St Helens is a great place to come and live. These people are despicable and must be found. I’m so sorry what [the family] have experienced. It’s not typical of St Helens residents and I’m sure they will come together to stamp hate out. If anyone has information please come forward.” A council official said it was too early to say whether the family would move back to the home that was badly damaged in the fire, but that their wishes would be “paramount in any decision we make”. St Helens council committed to receiving 60 refugees as part of the Syrian VPRS, which will see 20,000 refugees brought to the UK from camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan by 2020. Police are urging anyone with any information about the attack to call 101, quoting incident number 181 of 12 November, or to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-11-28T18:33:30Z,Refugee agency accused of helping deport relatives of migrant children,"The federal agency tasked with caring for asylum-seeking children separated from their parents at the US-Mexican border has officially taken on a new, little-publicized role in recent months: helping to deport relatives of the young migrants. More than 40 potential sponsors of detained migrant children in the US may be deported because a government agency that is supposed to help refugees instead uses minors to glean information on their US-based relatives, activists warned on Wednesday. Civil rights advocates said in a letter to top Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Wednesday that this data is being employed to “arrest and deport those families”, making these relatives “too scared to step forward to sponsor children”. The initiative – described as an information-sharing accord that was “quietly” solidified in April – reflects a novel role for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which comes under the HHS umbrella. The HHS section is supposed to help unaccompanied migrant children by reuniting them with family until their immigration cases are decided. “Children are being turned into bait to gather unprecedented amounts of information from immigrant communities,” Becky Wolozin, a Legal Aid Justice Center lawyer, said in the letter. From July to September, at least 41 family or household members of children who have been separated from their parents were detained for deportation due to this information-swapping. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) official recently told Congress that more than 80% of potential sponsors lived in the US illegally. Potential sponsors’ fingerprints and other personal information are entered into a DHS system. While this database was initially meant to track criminal records, it was modified in May to assist with immigration verification. Because authorities at local, state and federal levels of the US government have extensive access to this data, would-be sponsors could be put under unprecedented scrutiny. While federal authorities maintain this initiative is geared toward protecting migrant children from abusers and traffickers, migrant children entering the US unlawfully are spending increasing amounts of time in federal custody. Bob Carey, who ran the resettlement agency for nearly two years until January 2017, said the average time in custody for unaccompanied children “hovered around 33 days the entire time I was there”. Now it’s closer to 70 days, HHS says. Trump administration officials show no signs of budging. The Associated Press asked the Office of Refugee Resettlement how the new policies square with its mission to place children as quickly as possible with relatives or other sponsors. The office did not respond directly, but in an emailed reply called the longer stays “a symptom of the larger problem, namely a broken immigration system that encourages them to make the hazardous journey”. Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School says the arrangement effectively puts prospective sponsors in an “active queue” for deportation because their case files appear prominently when Ice enforcement agents open the database. DHS privacy policy says Ice can also share the information with “appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, foreign or international government agencies”. The revelations come amid ever heightening tensions over the US’s handling of asylum seekers – and increasingly rancorous debate over immigration policy. Dozens of people rushed toward the border crossing at Tijuana and San Diego on Sunday. A handful tried breaching the border fence, and US customs agents fired teargas to stop migrants from approaching. Mexico, which deported at least 100 migrants following the incident, announced plans to expel some 500 accused of trying to “illegally” and “violently” cross the border. American authorities said on Monday that they had arrested 42 migrants on the US side of the border."
2018-09-12T04:00:04Z,"No, Mr Salvini, migrants and refugees are not a burden – a photo essay","Migrants and refugees rarely get a good press. Headlines tend to accentuate the costs not the benefit of good hospitality. Politicians from the UK to US, Germany to Italy, rarely have a good word to say about them. But refugees are not all helpless dependents, hopelessly reliant on charity. They make economic contributions, grow GDP, start businesses and social enterprises, create jobs. For every one implicated in a crime, thousands more are raising children, volunteering, filling the skills shortage in Europe. It is perhaps in Italy where this gap between perception and reality has had the greatest political impact. Here we focus on five who defy the lazy political stereotyping of the Italian far right. Mohamed Shapoor If 20 years ago you had suggested to Cpl Mohamed Shapoor, who was then living among mortar attacks launched by the Taliban, that one day he would become a chef in Italy, he would have laughed in your face. But life is unpredictable, which is the most important lesson Shapoor has learned during his incredible existence. Now 47, Shapoor abandoned his military uniform and decorations in 2000, fleeing from an Afghanistan agonised by a war that continues to claim civilian victims. Today he is one of the most esteemed chefs in Palermo, Sicily, where he has been living for 10 years. “I thought I would wear that uniform forever,” he tells the Guardian with the stern glance of a soldier. “In time, I learned that that conflict was never going to end, and I decided to leave. Life has taught me that we are not victims of history, just that not everyone is lucky enough to realise it. “I am convinced that today, thanks to having fled my country, Mohamed Shapoor realises that he was not destined to be a corporal, but a chef in the land of pasta and pizza.” A flyer attached to the door of the restaurant Moltivolti in Ballarò, an ancient quarter of Palermo, announces the opening of enrolment in the “cooking class with Shapoor”. There are many people eager to learn how to prepare dopiaza, an Afghan dish made with onions, curry, garlic paste and chicken, or mantu, large medallions filled with veal and accompanied by a sauce made with vegetables and red squash. But the real attraction, as you might imagine, is Shapoor, a real legend in these parts. His customers, who come by the hundreds to fill the tables of Moltivolti, ask to speak with him after savouring his dishes. To offer their compliments, to be sure, but also to meet the legend of Cpl Shapoor, the nemesis of the Taliban who conquered Sicilian palates. Adibata Konata The “mother” of the inhabitants of Ballarò, now home to thousands of migrants, is a Junoesque woman from the Ivory Coast. It’s no coincidence that around here she is known as “Mama Africa”. Her name is Adibata Konata, she is 65, and for years she has offered the poor of Ballarò a warm meal and sometimes even a bed from a small restaurant in Santa Chiara square, just off the famous open-air market. It makes no difference if you cannot pay; Mama Africa’s restaurant is open to all of her “children”, including newly arrived migrants. Konata, born into a large middle-class family, has lived in Palermo for over 20 years. Her heart, however, is still in Ziga, a poor village in the heart of Sanmatenga, Burkina Faso, which she visited before arriving in Italy. Here Mama Africa invests her proceeds to refurbish hospitals and offer food, clothing, books, farm implements, and electrical and plumbing material, with the goal of raising the living standards of the inhabitants. “We started a small workshop with about 10 people who make necklaces, bracelets, and clothing items using raw materials from Africa. After paying the employees, all additional proceeds go to Ziga,” she says. “My work will probably never save Ziga from poverty, but as an African woman I feel a duty not to forget that our brothers and sisters live in the same conditions that forced us to leave. I cannot forget this.” Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde The story of Boubou Magassa and Adul Balde may seem ordinary. Yet these two 20-year-old migrants, who hail from Mali and Guinea respectively, found rare solace in Sicily in the form of a dignified job, a serene life, peace. Nothing more. They arrived on the coast of Sicily aboard a dinghy at the beginning of 2017, after having spent nearly a year of agony in Libya, among detention camps and harassment at the hands of militiamen and traffickers. Today they work as mechanics in the town of Riesi. Here, not only do Magassa and Balde contribute to Italy’s economy, but like many others, they have also helped revive this small town, which Italians gradually abandoned. The population of Riesi is nearing 10,000, down from more than 20,000 in the 1950s, and the town continues to lose 100 inhabitants each year. There are hundreds of small towns like Riesi across Italy that risk extinction. “We’re happy here,” says Magassa. “They treat us well. We didn’t have great expectations. We came here in search of good fortune, and we only hoped to find what we dreamt about: a normal life. This is our greatest achievement.” Atta Jacob Dozens of migrants queue up in front of Atta Jacob’s office each day to speak with him. Jacob, 31, who arrived from Ghana in 2008, is a representative for the CGIL, Italy’s largest labour union. To understand the long road that has enabled Jacob to earn a job, a desk, an office, and the respect of his colleagues, one must enter into the abyss of the San Ferdinando migrant camp, whichtoday is home to 1,000 people. Here, migrants live in shacks with no water or electricity. They have been called “new slaves” as they are exploited in the tomato fields and olive groves of southern Italy for meagre compensation. Until two years ago, Jacob was one of them. “I used to live in a shack like this one,” he says. “I worked in the fields with the others for €2 an hour. It was horrible. But people here are willing to withstand this and even more in order to survive.” The migrants waiting for Jacob in front of his office live in the San Ferdinando camp. His goal as union representative is to better their working conditions, while at the same time compelling the state not to forget that behind the “Made in Italy” brand are migrants such as them. “They are the ones who work in the fields eight, nine hours a day,” says Jacob, who left his eight-year-old daughter in Ghana, and hopes to reunite with her soon. “They are the ones who sweat under the sun to pick the tomatoes that are shipped all over the world. Ghanaians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Gambians, Malians – the same people that the government wants to expel.” Mamud Shamsu On the road from Caltanissetta to Palermo, Mamud Shamsu watches the cars speed by. Occasionally, someone stops to fill up. Shamsu walks up to the car, smiles, and begins pumping the petrol. His days as a petrol-station attendant in the Sicilian countryside have the same cadence, week after week. To some, his work may seem monotonous. It’s not a busy road, and it’s not easy to come upon talkative customers, but this is all Shamsu needs to get by in Italy, where the 28-year-old arrived 10 years ago from Ghana. “I consider myself incredibly lucky,” he says. “I know it’s not easy to find work in Sicily, especially if you’re a migrant. People from my country wait years for opportunity like this. “We’re not here to steal jobs from Italians, we’re here to work. We want to pay taxes like everyone else. No breaks. We just want the chance to build our lives, like everyone else.”"
2018-07-20T14:23:05Z,Libya rejects EU plan for refugee and migrant centres,"Libya has rejected a EU plan to establish refugee and migrant processing centres in the country, adding that it would not be swayed by any financial inducements to change its decision. The formal rejection by the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, is a blow to Italy, which is regarded as being close to his Tripoli administration. In June, Italy proposed reception and identification centres in Africa as a means of resolving divisions among European governments. The impasse came as the EU said it was willing to work as a temporary crisis centre to oversee the distribution of refugees and migrants from ships landing in Europe from Libya. Italy has said it is not willing to open its ports and may even reject those rescued by the EU Sophia search and rescue mission, a position that has infuriated other EU states. Speaking to the German newspaper Bild, Serraj said: “We are absolutely opposed to Europe officially wanting us to accommodate illegal immigrants the EU does not want to take in.” He dismissed accusations that Libya’s coastguard had shot at aid workers in ships trying to rescue people from the Mediterranean. “We save hundreds of people off the coast of Libya every day – our ships are constantly on the move,” he said. In practice, Libya is already running detention camps, largely as holding pens, but they are not run as EU processing centres for asylum claims.European foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday to do more to train the Libyan coastguard by setting up the EU’s own training team inside Libya. The European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said after a trip to Niger, one of the chief funnels for people into Libya, that the EU needed to plough more money into the Sahel region to reduce the need to leave the area. He said the number of people reaching Libya from Niger was collapsing. Tajani said: “Until 2016, 90% of irregular migrants travelled through the Niger to Libya and Europe. In just two years, Niger reduced migration flows by 95%, from over 300,000 to about 10,000 in 2018.” He said he would host a European conference in Brussels in October to support democratic elections in Libya scheduled for December. At the same time, Italy is to host a further conference in Rome in September seen as a follow-on to a conference held in May by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that led to a commitment to hold elections this year."
2018-12-29T20:08:25Z,Church of England urges compassion for Channel migrants,"The Church of England has urged greater compassion in the migration debate as new figures revealed an influx of lone child refugees among the boatloads of people crossing the Channel. As Sajid Javid faced calls by Tory MPs to deploy the Royal Navy to stop migrants reaching the UK, the Right Rev Trevor Willmott, bishop of Dover, said the home secretary needed to remember that those attempting the perilous crossing were people in need. “It is crucial that we all remember that we are dealing with human beings here,” said the bishop, speaking with the backing of the church. “Across the nation, we have been celebrating the season of hope and goodwill as we remember Christ’s birth – let’s not forget so soon that every person is precious.” On Sunday, six Iranian men were found on a Kent beach after crossing the Channel from France. The group were handed over to immigration authorities after arriving in Kingsdown, near Deal. Javid, who has cut short his family holiday to deal with the situation, escalated the government’s response after 12 Channel crossings were made by 89 migrants in four days. Since the start of November, 221 migrants are known to have attempted to cross the Channel to England. The rising number of boat crossings has prompted an increase in the number of unaccompanied child refugees to levels not recorded since the migrant camp in Calais was dismantled in October 2016, say local charities. One specialist facility that cares for unaccompanied minors, the Millbank Centre in Ashford, Kent, said it was caring for more than twice the usual level of occupants. Razia Shariff, chief executive officer of Kent Refugee Action Network, said there were between 40 to 50 minors, largely Iranian and Iraqi, being housed at its centre, compared with its usual level of just below 20. “It [had] gradually petered down from 2015-16 to a standard level, but in the last two months it’s just gone up again,” said Shariff. The charity Refugee Council, which runs a reception centre for lone child refugees in Dover, Kent, said that the number of unaccompanied minors had risen significantly last month. The centre, a safe space for child refugees at Britain’s busiest passenger port, recorded 21 unaccompanied children arriving in Kent in one week in mid-November, although the weekly total has subsequently fallen. In total, 31 lone child refugees arrived in Kent during November and another 13 children have so far been looked after at the Dover facility during December. On Saturday, immigration minister Caroline Nokes travelled to the port and met its Conservative MP, Charlie Elphicke, who has called on the authorities to “get a grip” and called for more patrol boats in the Channel. Javid has called the rise in arrivals a “major incident”. Yet, during the Dover visit, Nokes and Elphicke appeared to disagree on a way forward. The minister waved away demands for more patrol vessels stating: “It is feasible that, were we to put out additional craft, they might act as a magnet – encouraging people to make a perilous crossing.” Elphicke, though, was undeterred, saying: “I can’t actually understand why people would say these border cutters do a good job in the Mediterranean, but would do a bad job in the English Channel.” The UN’s migration agency yesterday called on the government to pursue a proportionate response to the arrivals, stressing that, in global terms, the numbers attempting to cross the Channel remained very small. Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organisation for Migration, said: “People seem to criticise migration because it’s easy to do and it’s easy to stir up passions but, actually, these are really small numbers if you compare them to what other European countries are going through.” Others urged the government to adopt a more “humane” approach. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said it was important to “ensure safe routes to sanctuary in Britain for those forced out of their homes, whether by war in Syria or persecution in Iran”. Sarah Jones, Labour MP and member of the home affairs committee, said a broader approach was required. “If we could do something to tackle the fact that more people are on the move across the globe than at any time in our history, we might actually stop this human tragedy,” she said. The recent rise in child refugees reaching southern England follows Home Office data showing that during the third quarter of the year, July to September, 799 UK asylum applications were made by unaccompanied children compared with 573 the previous quarter. The 799 figure is the second highest quarter total recorded during the past five years, second only to the period following the 2016 destruction of the migrant camp in Calais, when 1,176 child refugees arrived in the UK. Experts believe the rise in boat crossings is a response to aggressive tactics by French police that include routinely destroying makeshift refugee camps. Maurice Wren, head of the Refugee Council, said: “The fact that people are boarding flimsy boats to cross one of the world’s busiest and most dangerous shipping lanes highlights the sense of fear and hopelessness that is gripping so many of the people stuck in northern France. “Recent reports suggest that armed police are forcibly clearing and levelling the makeshift camps along the French coast, with the entirely predictable consequence that desperate people are again turning to smugglers who they see as offering their only hope of reaching safety.” He said the UK government needed to begin offering “more legal and dependable routes” for child refugees stranded in Europe."
2018-08-01T18:04:03Z,Art project listing names of dead refugees and migrants is destroyed,"An art project featuring a list of the 34,361 refugees and migrants who lost their lives trying to reach Europe has been destroyed in Liverpool. The list, which the Guardian published as a special supplement in June, was produced for World Refugee Day. It was posted on hoardings outside a building site in Liverpool’s Chinatown as part of the Liverpool Biennial art festival. On Wednesday the festival tweeted: Some people suggested a council worker may have mistaken the artwork for illegal flyposters and taken it down, but a spokesman for Liverpool city council said he had checked and was “100% sure” the list had not been removed by anyone employed by the local authority. The list was posted on the hoardings with the permission of the developers who own the site. They were trying to look at CCTV footage to see if their cameras had caught the culprit, the council spokesman said. Compiled and updated each year by United for Intercultural Action – an anti-discrimination network of more than 560 organisations across Europe – The List traces information relating to the deaths of 34,361 refugees and migrants who have lost their lives within or on the borders of Europe since 1993. In collaboration with art workers and institutions, the Istanbul-based artist Banu Cennetoğlu has produced up-to-date and translated versions of The List since 2007 using public spaces such as billboards, transport networks and newspapers. The Liverpool Biennial said in a statement: “It is timely and important to make The List public during a global refugee crisis. We were dismayed to see it had been removed on Saturday night and would like to know why. The List has been met with critical acclaim and we are doing everything we can to reinstate it.” Liverpool Biennial is the UK’s largest festival of contemporary visual art. Every two years, it commissions international artists to make and present work in the context of Liverpool in public spaces, galleries, museums and online."
2018-05-09T07:00:41Z,Refugee odyssey – photographing Mexico's Viacrucis Migrante,"The travelling caravan is an annual event that has been held around Easter since 2010. It aims to highlight the dangers migrants face, rather than to necessarily cross the border into the US, although many were expected to apply for asylum at the border. The final group of about 200 people were stopped in Tijuana with border authorities stating they could not accommodate them. The Reuters photographer Edgard Garrido joined the caravan route and filed an impressive body of work from the journey. The stops made along the way are shown in the map above; Matías Romero, Puebla, Mexico City, Tultitlán, Celaya, Irapuato, Tlaquepaque, Guadalajara, Mazatlán, Hermosillo, San Luis Río Colorado, Mexicali and, finally Tijuana. People sleep aboard a bus bound for Puebla in Matías Romero, 5 April. Many left homes in Honduras and El Salvador months before and joined the caravan for safety and solidarity. The number of people in the caravan had swollen to more than 1,000 when conservative US media outlets reported the “invasion”, prompting a furious response from the US president, Donald Trump. He called the migrants “dangerous”, ordered national guard troops to the border and demanded funding for a wall. José, 7, travels on an open wagon of a freight train, 14 April; right, waking up near the San Ysidro checkpoint, two weeks later, 30 April. Edgard spoke about people he met along the route: “I greeted a particular family from El Salvador every day, Mrs Lucia, her seven-year old son José and her sister Carla. José was a cheerful kid, he laughed all day, asked to use my camera and played with everything: paper, a wooden stick or a stone. His father was killed by the gangs and an older sister was forced to be the jaina (girlfriend) of a gang member. He became a symbol to me for what the caravan meant, in his innocent way he was exuberant and oblivious to the hardship of the trip. As were so many other members of the caravan.” A demonstration at Angel de la Independencia monument in Mexico City, 12 April. Hope in Tlaquepaque. A taxi ride before embarking on a new leg of the journey. “Generally, people would approach me and just talk, I believe they could sense a commitment from my side and they seemed to value it. The days were long, there was enough time to chat and photograph. Everything was flowing naturally.” Waiting next to the railway to try to board a freight train in Irapuato, 16 April. The Guardian asks Garrido to pick his favourite image from the assignment: “This is a difficult one, but this image is my favourite. When you are standing in front of a situation that makes a good photograph, your heart and your head tell you. This is what I felt instantly in this moment. Favourite shot: A woman holds a bag as she and fellow migrants cross a railway line to board a freight train in Irapuato, Guanajuato state, 17 April. “The atmosphere created by the light, the dirt, the train and that suitcase turned the image to be simply cinematographic, a movie right in front of my nose. It was the train of the exodus, a natural image in black and white, a part of human history, repeating itself over and over again. Migration, the flow of people around the world.” Members of the caravan wait to enter the US border and customs facility in Tijuana, 29 April. How do you feel the caravan story is different this year to previous years? Is it the presence of Trump in the White House and his emphasis on the Mexican border, or do you think there are wider issues? “For me this caravan represented the constant exodus of people coming from Central America, Haiti, Cuba or even Africa travelling through Mexico to reach the US. Especially Central Americans, who in an endless stream cross Mexico on foot, by bus or train all year long, pushed by common denominators, the uncontrollable violence by organised crime and the lack of any norms that could allow a decent life in their countries.” A bus rides past the border fence between Mexico and the US in Tijuana, 29 April; right, a child with a message for Trump near the San Ysidro checkpoint, 30 April. Garrido speaks about the relationships he formed with the people he met along the route: “The family I mentioned earlier and another family from Bajo Aguán in Honduras, an area riddled with violence and which I know very well; it surprised me they came from so far. The violence people are exposed to in Bajo Aguán is extremely brutal. Leaving that place takes a lot of courage and it’s not easy to get out of there. They looked always very decent, very preoccupied with their personal hygiene. “Nefi, a pleasant young man and his beautiful family, was educated, respectful and a doting husband and father to his wife and daughter. People were mocking him because he was always well dressed. He made me feel that my work was important. He would share his food with me, he was decent and a good guy.” Cristopher, 11, from El Salvador, travelling with a caravan through Mexico, draws at an improvised shelter in Irapuato, Guanajuato state, 16 April. “There was Cristopher, a photography aficionado who followed me all the time, and his lovely grandmother, who took care of me, maybe because Cristopher and I connected so well through something we loved and shared. “Angel, a single father, travelling with his six-year old son, Jefrey, reminded me so much of Chen Kaige’s movie Together.” A father and son on a freight train in Hidalgo state, 14 April. “And David, an extrovert young man from El Salvador, who I called with fondness ‘the producer’ because he organised everything, where and how people had to line up for food, lists with names, the departure of the caravan – he was always there. Tireless and joking.” A protest on the border fence between Mexico and the US in Tijuana, 29 April. Were there any particular moments you want to talk about? “There are many moments and I probably might have forgotten already a lot of things but I do remember the day we boarded the train for the first time in Tultitlán. “People were afraid, there was a lot of talk of accidents and massacres and the young men armed themselves with stones to repel any assaults along the route. “When they saw something strange they alerted everyone with banging the stones against the wagons. It was a deafening and frightening sound, very scary.” An open wagon of a freight train in Michoacán state, 17 April. “Another moment I remember vividly was when one night the train was pulled by three engines. It was very cold and the train reached an incredible speed. People were huddling under blankets and it was a strange sight in the night, headless human bundles sitting next to each other trying to stay warm. A man gave me a blanket, I pulled it over my head, plugged in my headphones and started to sing.” Moving moment: Garrido is left holding a baby. “One day a woman handed me her baby and said: ‘Hold the baby for a moment’, and she just left! I wanted to take pictures but obviously I couldn’t; I was holding somebody else’s baby in my arms. She came back after 20 minutes and she just picked it up from my arms. It was funny and people mocked me a lot.” A safe place to sleep: behind an altar inside a Catholic church which also serves as a temporary shelter in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco state, 18 April. Garrido on the challenges of shooting the story: “Accidents, organised crime, lack of sleep, hunger, the excessive sun during the day, the cold during the night. It becomes trickier when riding on a freight train. On a freight train in Hidalgo state, 14 April. “When following a group of migrants who don’t stop much, logistics become more complicated. To secure a real place to sleep and rest and clean up once in a while, to get a decent meal, to regain strength and to continue with my work becomes much more complex.” A temporary shelter in Hermosillo, Sonora state, 23 April. Amid the struggle to stay safe and well fed with shelter at night, there were some lighter moments in the journey for Garrido. One day in Sinaloa state, about halfway along the pilgrimage, he shot some people taking a break in the ocean at Mazatlán. A beach day in Mazatlan, in Sinaloa state, 20 April. A moment of prayer near the San Ysidro checkpoint. Did Garrido find people willing to be photographed or did they prefer to remain anonymous for fear of prejudicing their asylum applications? “When they see you day and night for almost a month you just start to live together, you don’t analyse the situation, you coexist. And they didn’t care that I was photographing them. And when I wanted to do a portrait or shoot video of someone, I always asked them first and nobody said no.

Border fence demonstrators in Tijuana, 29 April. The banner reads ‘diversity without borders’. “They only fear being deported or sent back, as they are aware of the risks they face by returning to their neighbourhoods. Gangs know exactly who has left the neighbourhood and retaliatory action is part of a routine in this structure.” A man and his daughter run between pigeons at the end of their journey, prior to preparations for an asylum request in the US, in Tijuana, Baja California, 28 April. Garrido on his overall experience and that of his colleagues on the journey: “It has been a rewarding experience, full of emotions, good moments, just impossible to ignore as a photojournalist. You are there and you are part [of the caravan]; otherwise images will be superficial and without a real message. Throughout this voyage I worked with my colleague Encarni Pindado, a photographer who has specialised in everything related to migration. She was solid and great company, I can only thank her. I would also like to thank my colleagues at Reuters. Things were taken care of so I could work in peace. It was great teamwork and support in every sense.”"
2018-12-13T21:00:23Z,Coalition plans inquiry into integration and employment of refugees,"The federal government has announced an inquiry into the “integration, employment and resettlement” of refugees and humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review, to be led by Professor Peter Shergold, has broad ranging terms of reference that would allow the investigation of welfare and support services, employment requirements and work rights, and any other factor that relates to the improvement of outcomes for resettled refugees and the community. Shergold, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, has been tasked to develop recommendations to improve policy and “better ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy,” said prime minister Scott Morrison. It can invite submissions and seek information, and is expected to report back by late February. Guardian Australia understands the terms of reference allow Shergold significant freedom to examine all aspects of support services and employment issues for refugees and humanitarian migrants. “The review should seek out best practice case studies of how Australians can work together to encourage integration of refugees and humanitarian entrants in the wider community, including identifying significant barriers to success,” said one term of reference. Shergold told Guardian Australia the focus of the review was those settled in Australia as refugees, who have equivalent rights to citizenship, rather than asylum seekers. “It’s generally seen that refugees come with many skills and experiences, and refugees tend to be risk takers, entrepreneurial,” he said. “They are the group of Australians most likely to derive income from setting up family businesses. They problem is … it’s the hardest thing to do because you have to overcome language barriers, you need your overseas qualifications and experience accepted, and your first experience in the Australian labour market.” He said assisting this was something governments struggled with the most, and the JobActive employment program “isn’t working particularly well”. Shergold, who is coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW, will be joined on the review by Kerrin Benson, chief executive of Multicultural Development Australia, and Margaret Piper, the former executive director of the Refugee Council of Australia. “I think it’s important that almost from the day refugees arrive, we start to talk to them from day one, about what are their aspirations for employment … and provide them with the advice they need,” he said. “It’s no use waiting for two or three years and then talking to them.” Shergold declined to comment on recent cuts to support for asylum seekers on temporary visas, who would potentially become refugees accessing the support services the review will recommend. Last year the government began stripping services and welfare payments from a large cohort of asylum seekers currently on short term bridging visas, giving them work rights but removing housing support and other payments. The decisions, which have continued to roll out this year, have been condemned by refugee, migrant and community services sectors, who say it will force people into homelessness and poverty, and appears to have been applied arbitrarily to people including the ill and elderly, despite their lower capacity to support themselves. Earlier this month parliament passed legislation forcing another group of migrants – those on permanent skilled or family visas – to wait up to four years for some welfare support services and payments. The review was announced via press release from Morrison and the immigration minister, David Coleman. “We want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help people get jobs and integrate into the community,” Morrison said. “Having a job gives people financial independence, increases their personal connections and is one of the quickest ways to improve language skills.” Coleman said Australia had clear responsibilities in building a stronger and “more socially cohesive” society. “This review will ensure refugee and humanitarian entrants, those that have already arrived and those not yet here, are best placed to succeed and contribute to the Australian way of life.” Labor questioned the need for the review when the joint standing committee on migration had already investigated settlement outcomes for migrants, including refugees. The committee recommended the Jobactive program include employment support services specifically designed for newly arrived and longer term migrants. The government “noted” but did not accept the recommendation, saying it was already “taking steps to provide better support for newly arrived refugees”. Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, questioned the timing of the announcement. “Why is Scott Morrison trying to rush this review through the Christmas period?” Neumann said."
2018-09-10T05:15:42Z,Migration: how many people are on the move around the world?,"Migrants, expats, asylum seekers, refugees, IDPs – what are the differences? These are loaded words because they often suggest a backstory or motive that may be inaccurate. According to the 1951 United Nations refugee convention, the difference between refugees and asylum seekers is clear. An asylum seeker has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution. A refugee has already received such protection. Refugees have the right to international protection while seeking asylum is a human right, which means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum. Internally displaced people (IDPs) are essentially on the run in their own country: putative refugees who have not been able or willing to cross an international border. When it comes to migrants, definitions are far woollier. Some presume a migrant is on the move to seek a better life. But if that person is leaving the penury and starvation of a dustbowl farm in the Sahel in order to survive,, are they a migrant or a refugee? The International Organization for Migration (IOM) therefore defines a migrant as any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a state regardless of legal status, whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary, what the causes for the movement are, and what the length of the stay is. Expatriate is a weakly defined term that essentially means anyone living outside their native country. In practice, expat has come to mean a migrant from a rich country. How many of each are there? We are now witnessing the highest levels of movement on record. About 258 million people, or one in every 30, were living outside their country of birth in 2017. That is both a record high – there were 173 million in 2000 – and an alarmingly volatile figure: a 2003 projection anticipated that by 2050, there would be up to 230 million international migrants. The latest revised projection is that there will be 405 million international migrants by 2050. Even those figures, however, fail to capture the full reality. There were 25.9 million refugees and asylum seekers in mid-2017. But registered refugees represent only a fraction of all those forced to leave their homes for reasons spanning from war to environmental crisis. In total, at least 66 million people globally are experiencing forced displacement – approximately 40.3 million of whom are IDPs. As for expats, estimates vary wildly, depending on definition. The state department reckons 9 million Americans live overseas. About 5 million Britons are thought to do so. Finally, there are 10 million people who are stateless, with no citizenship at all. Which countries produce – and which receive – the most migrants? According to the IOM, the US, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UK were the top five destinations for migrants in 2015. The US has about 46 million foreign-born residents, Germany about 12 million. India, Mexico, Russia, China and Bangladesh were the top five origin countries. Nearly half of all international migrants came from Asia, although it is still far more common for Asians and Africans to move within their own continent than to settle further afield. And which countries take and produce the most refugees? The US has historically resettled more refugees than all other countries in the world combined, though in recent years, its intake has slowed. In 2016, it took in 85,000 refugees. That same year, the then-president, Barack Obama, committed to resettling 110,000 refugees in the 2017 fiscal year, a 57% increase from 2015 numbers. Later in 2017, however, the new president, Donald Trump, slashed the cap to 45,000. According to the International Rescue Committee, the US will only resettle 21,292 refugees in the current fiscal year. By contrast, some of the world’s poorer and often less stable countries – such as Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan and Uganda – are now the long-term hosts to the world’s largest populations of refugees. Turkey is currently the leading host of refugees, with 3.5 million, followed by Uganda and Pakistan, which both host about 1.4 million, according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. In all, 57% of refugees come from just three countries: Syria (6.3 million) Afghanistan (2.4 million) and South Sudan (2.3 million). Meanwhile, Colombia hosts the greatest number of internally displaced people – 7.6 million as of 2017.] But many refugees slip through the gaps when attempts at record-keeping take place. For example, official figures usually exclude Palestinian refugees because they don’t fall into the specific mandate of UN refugees. A separate agreement was reached on their behalf when the 1951 refugee convention was drawn up, specifically to try to avoid what has nevertheless come to pass: a permanent acceptance of their displacement. The number of Palestinian refugees varies depending on the source but there are reckoned to be between 5.3 million and 6.5 million – around one in three of all refugees worldwide. The US last month announced it was cutting all funding to the main Palestinian refugee programme. How long do people remain refugees and IDPs? Not only are the numbers of refugees and migrants underestimated but so too is the chronic length of time refugees remain displaced in camps and so-called “temporary” situations. There are still Palestinian refugees forced from their country in 1948 living in camps in Syria, Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees who have been living in camps in Sudan since the mid-1960s, Afghan refugees who have been in camps in Pakistan since the Soviet invasion in 1979. The list goes on. Moreover, many of the countries from which large numbers of people are forced to flee conflict – such as Syria, South Sudan, Iraq and Yemen – are also host to very large internally displaced populations. “Politically, Europe had a panic in 2015 and 2016 about the scale of movement of people to a whole continent, and [in] particular, to rich ones,” said Steve Valdez-Symonds, the director of refugee and migrants rights at Amnesty. “But that scale of movement doesn’t match the move from South Sudan to Uganda less than a year later and doesn’t far exceed what has even more recently happened across Myanmar/Bangladesh border, or in Venezuela where large numbers of people are moving to Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and other countries in that region.” What about the political response? Migration is arguably politically less acceptable than at any point since the end of the second world war. The anti-immigration response of governments across Europe, and in American and Australia has sent quite clear signs to some of those frontline countries that they can build walls and force back those seeking safe havens. “The last few years have seen quite threatening movements by countries that had offered refugees a relative degree of safety,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Of Kenya towards its refugee Somali populations, for example, and of Pakistan towards its Afghan refugees.” There is an additional complication involving those fleeing environmental disasters, such as flooding or desertification. The 1951 convention doesn’t define these people as refugees but, as Bill Frelick, Human Rights Watch’s refugee rights programme director, says: “If someone’s life is in danger, it really shouldn’t matter if it’s because of a gun or a landslide or earthquake.” Are any countries holding their heads up in this maelstrom? Sadly, experts say not. “I don’t know that anyone has it right,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Canada has a very large and, in many ways, a very good resettlement programme for refugees. But for those who seek asylum across Canada’s borders, its response to those people is not all that good: it has major issues of long-term use of detention centres for those crossing its borders.” Frelick said: “I don’t know of any country I can point to and say: ‘This place has got it right.’ You can say some aspects are far better than other places. The UK can probably still hold itself up as a comparatively better place for resettlement than many others. But our response to asylum seekers is not especially healthy and our response has generally deteriorated over time.” Where does trafficking fit in? Political and public hostility to migration has resulted in a dramatic reduction in legal routes to migration in the past 20 years. This has encouraged a burgeoning business in illegal people trafficking, now reckoned to be worth more than $150bn each year. Principal areas of activity are from south to north in the Americas (there are an estimated 3m illegal entries into the US each year, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime); from Africa and the Middle East into Europe; and from south Asia west to the Gulf and Europe beyond. Death is common. According to the IOM’s missing migrants project, almost 30,000 people have died in transit over the past five years, with the Mediterranean, north Africa and central America particularly deadly. What next? The UN is to formally agree a new global compact on migration in Marrakech this December, following 18 months of negotiations. Protagonists say the deal promises a better, more coordinated approach to migration, though efforts have been damaged by the US pulling out of the talks halfway through.

2018-07-13T09:00:10Z,Moscow refugee tournament throws stark light on Russia’s migrant policy,"A few hours before England’s World Cup game against Colombia in Moscow, a very different series of football matches was under way on Red Square. There was no penalty shootout drama but off the pitch the stakes for some of those involved were much higher. The five-a-side tournament, held just outside the walls of the Kremlin, pitted teams of refugees against each other, and was meant both as a celebration of diversity through football and as a message to the Kremlin over Russia’s restrictive asylum policy. Some of the players had fled conflict in Africa or the Middle East, while others were aspiring footballers from African countries who had been trafficked to Russia with the promise of a playing contract. One was Joshua Olumide, an 18-year-old from Ondo State in Nigeria, who said his father had taken out a loan to pay a man who promised him a contract with a European club. He was given a Fan ID, the document that allows visa-free travel to Russia for the duration of the World Cup, and told he would be met at the airport in Moscow. Nobody met him and another Nigerian who had also made the journey with a promise of a contract. He spent five days living in the airport and has since been living in makeshift accommodation in Russia trying to get money together for a ticket home. “It’s very sad but I am going to have to go home. My father took out a big loan to help me come here,” he said. Russians have welcomed with open arms the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have descended on the country but it is feared the effect may be only temporary and is unlikely to extend to those seeking sanctuary rather than just arriving for a few weeks of football. Svetlana Gannushkina, one of the leading Russian rights activists working with migrants and refugees, said Russia’s basic position on asylum is “nobody is given status and we pretend that refugees don’t exist”. She said only 592 people had been given refugee status in Russia in recent years. The one exception has been those fleeing the conflict in eastern Ukraine, who have a relatively easy path to either temporary residency or citizenship. For Syrians, of whom Gannushkina estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 seeking refugee status in Russia, the process is much harder: she said only two had been granted status. The tournament on Red Square was a reminder that many refugees are talented and hard-working and she hoped the “celebratory, friendly mood” of the World Cup would continue after the tournament is over. “It’s really symbolic to have these games played here,” said Piara Powar, the executive director of Fare, an umbrella organisation promoting diversity in football that helped set up the tournament. “To see these guys, some of whom have no papers, whose kids are being fed and educated by volunteer groups, playing football in the shadow of the Kremlin is quite something.” He said assurances had been sought and given by Russian authorities that the refugees would not face document checks or arrest if they came to Red Square for the tournament. Alexei Smertin, the former Chelsea and Russia midfielder, and the anti-racism inspector for Russia’s World Cup committee, played in one of the games, which took place on a five-a-side pitch set up on Red Square for the duration of the World Cup. Other games have included a match between England and Russia fans, which the Russians won 15-1."
2018-10-02T11:28:02Z,Pro-refugee Italian mayor arrested for 'aiding illegal migration',"The mayor of an Italian town that has won praise and TV publicity for integrating thousands of refugees has been placed under house arrest on suspicion of abetting illegal migration. Riace mayor Domenico Lucano – hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders – is also accused of fraudulently awarding contracts for waste disposal as well as organising “marriages of convenience” between local men and foreign women. His partner, Tesfahun Lemlem, faces the same charges and has had her residency blocked. The investigation against Lucano began more than a year ago, although more serious allegations of embezzlement and fraud were dropped. His arrest comes a week after Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, announced a series of anti-immigration measures that included slashing funds for migrant reception and integration. It also follows the suspension by the public broadcaster, Rai, of a TV show about Riace, which had been lauded as an exemplary model for integration. Salvini shared news of Lucano’s arrest on Twitter, alongside a comment that also made a dig at the anti-mafia author, Roberto Saviano, a staunch critic of his policies. “Damn, who knows what Saviano and all the other do-gooders who want to fill Italy with immigrants will say now,” the far-right League leader wrote. The Guardian was unable to reach Lucano for comment. His migrant integration project began more than a decade ago as a way to repopulate and revive the economy of the Calabrian town whose population by 2004 had dwindled to 500 from about 3,000 before the second world war. Thousands of migrants are estimated to have passed through since then, with about 500 making up today’s population of 1,500. Gioacchino Criaco, a writer from Calabria who knows Lucano well, said he foresaw the mayor’s arrest even before the investigation began. “He showed how it was possible to do concrete things with limited means,” Criaco said. “Efficiency and humanity are not welcomed in a cynical system. This is a system that only takes consensus from politics of fear. In this respect, examples of virtuousness must be eradicated.” Criaco said Lucano was an honest man but that the “rules on the reception and management of migrants are too tangled, and often administrators can find themselves caught in a dilemma between a humanitarian choice and a legal one”. Salvini has cracked down on immigration since becoming interior minister in June, closing off the sea ports and pledging to “end the gravy train” for those working in the migrant reception business. Lucano received a show of support on his Facebook page, with Riace locals calling on each other to rally together in solidarity. Sergio Bontempelli, a migrant rights campaigner with the Association of Rights and Borders, said that Riace had become too well known as an example of good integration and had been under attack for years. He said other integration projects undertaken by hundreds of people in other Italian towns were now at risk."
2018-11-29T11:00:06Z,Calling this exodus a 'migrant caravan' obscures the heart of the matter | Mark Isaacs,"When I first heard of the “migrant caravan” I thought it was a grossly inadequate way to describe this mass movement of people. The more I have learned about the movement, the more convinced I am of its inappropriateness as a definition. Thus far, I have been using it for social media purposes but I want to break down the terminology. The term “migrant” is a misnomer. It gives the impression that these people have similar situations to us. It implies they can apply for a visa, get a job and relocate their families the legal way just like an Australian might migrate to the United Kingdom for work. It is misleading to use the term migrants for a group of people who are fleeing criminal violence, authoritarian governments, corrupt security forces, economic failure and extreme poverty. It is misleading to imply that these people have the same opportunities to migrate as people from Australia, the US or other wealthy nations. While there are legal visas from Central American people to travel, live and work in the US, the likelihood of these “caravan” people – who are for the most part members of the impoverished working class – being allowed legal entry to the US is low. Their “flight risk” would be considered high and as a result they would most likely not be awarded visas or be allowed into the country. There is also the challenge of their own capability to navigate the immigration system, obtain passports, visas and flights. That’s why for many the decision to join the caravan was impulsive. They took what they saw as an opportunity when it arose, not really understanding the immigration process. Many have been learning about migration law, the asylum-seeking and refugee process, and repatriation rights on the road to the US thanks to the work of UNHCR and other such organisations. Perhaps I wouldn’t feel so strongly about this term if I hadn’t seen “migrant” used negatively before. European countries used the same language when describing the influx of refugees fleeing Syria and Afghanistan as a “migrant crisis”. Such language masked the fact that these people were running away from war zones and violence and justified European countries’ desire to refuse assistance. Many of those European countries were directly responsible for the conditions that precipitated the mass movement of people throughout the region. If US and Nato had properly stabilised and rebuilt Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US and Nato invasion, then the next decade and more of conflict in Afghanistan wouldn’t have forced so many “migrants” to the European continent. Similar geopolitical dynamics are being played out in the US currently. This is a mass exodus of people from Central American states that have been the victims of US political interventions for decades. Ongoing US intervention in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has destabilised and militarised the region, leading to an increase in people migrating to the US. Blaming immigrants for fleeing poverty and violence is a simple response to a complex problem. A better way to stem the future flow of migrants might be to re-examine US foreign policy in Central America. President Trump is happy to ignore this history, or perhaps he never learned the lessons of US foreign policy. He has been using the “migrant caravan” as a political tool, ramping up his already virulent anti-migrant rhetoric to stoke fear and suspicion of the members of the caravan and militarise the border. His manipulation of the issue shows how important language can be when talking about displaced people. The reality is that many of these people face dire threats to their life, whether that be directly due to violence or indirectly due to poverty and political instability. Many people in the caravan intend to ask for asylum when they reach the border of the United States. Many have already asked for asylum in Mexico and have been awarded refugee visas. Many people have told me that they are leaving their countries because there is no work but even then I don’t believe the term migrant is necessarily the appropriate terminology to use. In these cases, it is impossible to separate the poverty of the country from the deteriorating political situation and violence that also exists in the country. Often loss of work or inability to find employment precipitates the decision to leave a country, but often the decision to leave one’s country is multifactorial. My argument is not that none of the members of the “caravan” are migrants. My argument is that calling it a “migrant caravan” creates a blanket evaluation of all these people’s stories and allows judgment and suspicion to creep into the minds of the general public. Perhaps there needs to be a new definition for such people, one that acknowledges the dire circumstances which cause them to leave their homes. Perhaps calling them a humanitarian migrant might help.

2018-11-21T17:28:50Z,What is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe?,"More than three years after Europe’s biggest influx of migrants and refugees since the second world war, tensions between EU member states over how to handle irregular immigration from outside the bloc – mainly from the Middle East and Africa – remain high. What is the scale of migration? Numbers are sharply down from their 2015-16 peak because of a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, new border fences in the Balkans, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people are still trying to reach Europe. The UNHCR says Spain has taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea so far this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500. Overland arrivals in Greece have climbed sharply to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period last year. The underlying factors that have led to more than 1.8 million migrants coming to Europe since 2014 have not gone away; most observers believe it is only a matter of time before the number of arrivals picks up significantly once more. Why is it a problem? Everyone agrees Europe needs to urgently overhaul its asylum and immigration rules. At present Spain, Italy and Greece take most of the strain owing to their geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea and the fact that, under EU law, asylum seekers must lodge their applications in the first EU country they enter. However, no one can agree on what to do: some countries want tougher external border controls, others fairer distribution of new arrivals. Any solution will have to balance the concerns of “frontline” southern states with those of wealthier northern “destination” states, while dealing with the refusal of hardline central and eastern ones (such as Hungary and Poland) to accept any migrants at all. What is the wider political context? With anti-immigration sentiment on the rise across the continent, the presence in Italy’s government of the far-right League party of Matteo Salvini, which campaigned on a pledge to send 500,000 irregular migrants home, is making itself felt. The similarly rightwing, populist Freedom party is sharing power in Austria. In Germany – which welcomed more than 1 million migrants in 2015 under Angela Merkel’s open-door policy – the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has kept immigration firmly at the top of the political agenda. After a series of electoral setbacks, the chancellor has said she will not stand again. Polling shows immigration and terrorism remain EU citizens’ top concerns. Where do things stand? The death toll on the central Mediterranean route to Italy has fallen in the past year, but the number of those drowning as a proportion of arrivals has risen sharply to 2,054 so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Amid a string of high-profile cases of migrant rescue boats left drifting at sea, NGO vessels have all but disappeared from the main migration routes to Italy following Salvini’s announcement after taking office this summer that he was closing Italian ports to non-Italian rescue vessels. European leaders papered over their divisions at a crunch summer summit but have so far dodged any formal agreement on refugee quotas, with central states rejecting any form of mandatory action. What will happen now? Merkel is on record as saying the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, but although leaders agree on the need to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, details are scarce. Efforts will be shared, but only voluntarily. Members are to take in rescued migrants and establish centres to assess asylum claims on their soil, and the bloc will explore regional processing platforms in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. But so far none of these countries have agreed to help, while a couple have ruled themselves out. Meanwhile Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, is leading a call among some states for a “strong border” to stop an “invasion”. Nothing is yet settled."
2018-06-25T06:15:53Z,"'Tourists go home, refugees welcome': why Barcelona chose migrants over visitors","Early last year, around 150,000 people in Barcelona marched to demand that the Spanish government allow more refugees into the country. Shortly afterwards, “Tourists go home, refugees welcome” started appearing on the city’s walls; soon the city was inundated with protestors marching behind the slogans “Barcelona is not for sale” and “We will not be driven out”. What the Spanish media dubbed turismofobia overtook several European cities last summer, with protests held and measures taken in Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, Florence, Berlin, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca and elsewhere in Europe against the invasion of visitors. But in contrast to many, as fiercely as Barcelona has pushed back against tourists, it has campaigned to welcome more refugees. When news broke two weeks ago that a rescue ship carrying 629 migrants was adrift in the Mediterranean, mayor Ada Colau was among the first to offer those aboard safe haven. Is it really the case that Barcelona would prefer to receive thousands of penniless immigrants rather than the millions of tourists who last year spent around €30bn in the city? The short answer, it appears, is yes. Increasingly it is tourism, not immigration, that people see as a threat to the city’s very identity – though numbers of both have risen exponentially in recent decades. In 2000 foreigners accounted for less than 2% of the population; a mere five years later, the figure was 15% (266,000). In 2018, it is now officially 18% although, according to Lola López, the city’s integration and immigration commissioner, the true figure is closer to 30%. The influx of new residents has radically changed the face of the city, but Barcelona has not seen a single anti-immigrant protest of any substance – nor is immigration an issue at local elections. According to research by Paolo Giaccaria, a social scientist at the University of Turin, the case of Barcelona “establishes a connection between two types of mobility that are at odds with each other: northern tourism and southern migration. It subverts the common feeling about which kind of mobility is desirable which is not.” Immigration has changed the city, but tourism is destabilising it – and even people in the industry agree that it can’t go on like this. In 1990 the city received 1.7 million tourists; last year the figure was 32 million – roughly 20 times the resident population. The sheer volume of visitors is driving up rents, pushing residents out of neighbourhoods, and overwhelming the public space. “We see immigration as having a positive impact – people have integrated well,” says Natalia Martínez, a councillor in Ciutat Vella, the old part of Barcelona which has been at the forefront of both immigration and tourism. “It’s brought more than it’s taken away in terms of identity.” Her colleague Santi Ibarra argues that the diversity that comes with immigration enhances the city – but tourism contributes nothing positive. “Tourism takes something out of neighbourhoods,” he says. “It makes them more banal – the same as everywhere else.” Like London, the number of native Barcelonans is quite small, especially in working class neighbourhoods, which is where most of the latest wave of immigrants have made their homes. The three largest groups of immigrants are Europeans, Latin Americans and North Africans, mainly from Morocco, as well as significant Chinese and Pakistani populations – though López says that Barcelona has its own identity, distinct from that of Catalonia or Spain. “We’ve found that children born here of immigrant or mixed couples tend to identify themselves as being from Barcelona, rather than anywhere else.” The main obstacle to integration is language, especially as schooling is in Catalan, which none of the immigrants speak. Magda Martí is a headteacher in a primary school in Ciutat Vella, where more than half the children are foreigners and says that, along with language barrier, food can also be an issue. The city council requires the school to provide a halal meal option if only one family requests it; Martí says this is tricky, not only logistically but ideologically for a non-religious school. However, she adds: “To me it’s all the same where a child is from, the important thing is to make them and their families welcome. The really positive change is in the new teachers, who don’t see immigration as a problem. They see diversity as something positive, which is how I see it, too.” The neighbourhood where immigration is most visible is El Raval (from the Arabic, meaning suburb), which lies on the opposite side of La Rambla from Ciutat Vella, and has long been synonymous with drugs and prostitution. Until quite recently it was known as Barri Xinès (Chinatown), though there were no Chinese people there – a reflection of its perceived otherness. These days it’s nicknamed Ravalstan for its sizeable Pakistani population. Oscar Esteban, director of the Fundació Tot Raval, an umbrella group that coordinates a wide range of voluntary and statutory organisations in the area, compares el Raval to the east London borough of Tower Hamlets: both historically port neighbourhoods, and for centuries the point of entry to the city. (Similarly, life expectancy in El Raval is five to six years less than in the city’s more salubrious areas.) “El Raval has its own identity and its own way of dealing with things,” says Esteban. “Everything starts here, many social phenomena appear here first and then spread; we’re a social laboratory. There’s a massive level of immigration here but on a day-to-day level there’s no conflict, not even after the terror attack last summer.” Thirteen people died and over 130 were injured in the van attack on La Rambla in August last year. Mohammed Halhoul, the foundation’s president and a member of the Catalan Islamic Council, says that afterwards people were “shocked and indignant, but everyone came together to condemn it”. Halhoul – who came to Barcelona from Morocco in 1990 – attributes the lack of a backlash against the Muslim community to broad political consensus on immigration, and the city’s strong network of community associations. “There are isolated cases but when it comes to racism or Islamophobia, we don’t see it as a problem,” he says. “It’s not something we lose any sleep over.” Of course racism exists in Barcelona inasmuch as it does in any other city – but it has not been allowed to fester. Since 2010 the council has pursued a intercultural policy (as opposed to assimilation) to recognise and respect cultural and religious differences that has enjoyed widespread support, and immigrants have not been scapegoated despite years of economic hardship. But if they have succeeded in escaping a backlash, tourists have not – even though tourism accounts for around 12% of Barcelona’s GDP, and many residents’ jobs depend on it. “There’s no question that a lot of people here live off tourism, but it can’t be a case of anything goes – there have to be limits,” says Esteban. “We’re losing much of the identity of the centre of the city, the port, the very traditions that attract visitors.After 20 years of city authorities flogging Barcelona to visitors from overseas, the council elected in 2015 has moved to put the needs of citizens above those of visitors. It imposed a moratorium on new hotels, made efforts to contain the spread of tourist apartments and devised an urban plan for Ciutat Vella that prioritises local commerce over businesses aimed at tourists. Albert Recio, a spokesman for the Barcelona Federation of Residents Associations representing around 100 bodies, says the dizzying rise of city breaks has had a significant impact on housing, with landlords choosing to make easy money renting to tourists, rather than residents and driving up rents in the process. Public services are also feeling the strain. “People who live near the popular tourist spot of Park Güell can’t get on the bus because it’s full of tourists,” Recio says. “And many traditional businesses that have existed for over 100 years have been driven out.” Barcelona is not alone in its battle to protect its identity, with many European cities being overwhelmed by skyrocketing tourism fuelled by cheap flights and platforms such as Airbnb. According to the Association of British Travel Agents, 53% of British holidays in 2017 were city breaks compared to 41% beach holidays. Antipathy has reached especial heights in Venice, which last month erected barriers in an attempt to control crowds. “In Venice people hate tourists, especially the cruiseships – the worst kind of tourism,” says Patrizia Riganti, who teaches at the school of architecture at Nottingham Trent University and has researched the impact of immigration and tourism in Amsterdam and Venice. “They pollute the city, and consume it as though they were eating a sandwich, what in Italian we call ‘mordi e fuggi tourism’: literally, take a bite and run. “As in Barcelona, the presence of tourists in Venice and the competition for services far outweigh any perceived problems about immigrants who, thanks partly to tourism, can’t afford to live there anyway,” says Riganti. In Lisbon, too, they are feeling the negative impact of mass tourism. Fátima Bernardo, assistant professor of social sciences at the University of Évora in Portugal, fears that the Alfama district in Lisbon may face a similar fate to Ciutat Vella, as another neighbourhood with a strong community and sense of identity. “What tourists like about Alfama is its authenticity, but now it’s too expensive and young people can’t afford to live there, only older people with secure tenancies, so Alfama is dying,” Bernardo says. “The neighbourhood’s social dynamic has changed. “People in Lisbon are very worried about the possibility that our city and our identity might become like Barcelona – a parody and a theme park.” The real issue is the pressure on public space which is not designed to cope with the volume of visitors. Tourists occupy bars and restaurants that were once popular among locals, they saturate public transport and clog pavements, and use far more resources such as water than locals. Residents say the sensation is of being under occupation. It’s this that gives Barcelonans the sense of displacement, that their city and its identity are being stolen from them, making them little more than extras on the set of their own city – a sensation that not even large-scale immigration has provoked. In Barcelona especially, immigrants are seen as part of the fabric – working, building communities, and generally making a contribution to the city while tourists simply use it. “The image of the city that the people themselves have projected is of a place of welcome,” says López of the ease with which new immigrants integrate in Barcelona. But – at least for the foreseeable future – tourists can expect a different reception. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
2018-10-30T05:30:07Z,The unseen driver behind the migrant caravan: climate change,"Thousands of Central American migrants trudging through Mexico towards the US have regularly been described as either fleeing gang violence or extreme poverty. But another crucial driving factor behind the migrant caravan has been harder to grasp: climate change. Most members of the migrant caravans come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – three countries devastated by violence, organised crime and systemic corruption, the roots of which can be traced back to the region’s cold war conflicts. Experts say that alongside those factors, climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty. And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US. “The focus on violence is eclipsing the big picture – which is that people are saying they are moving because of some version of food insecurity,” said Robert Albro, a researcher at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. “The main reason people are moving is because they don’t have anything to eat. This has a strong link to climate change – we are seeing tremendous climate instability that is radically changing food security in the region.” Migrants don’t often specifically mention “climate change” as a motivating factor for leaving because the concept is so abstract and long-term, Albro said. But people in the region who depend on small farms are painfully aware of changes to weather patterns that can ruin crops and decimate incomes. Pausing for a rest as the first of the three recent migrant caravans passed through the Mexican town of Huixtla last week, Jesús Canan described how he used to sow maize and beans on a hectare of land near the ancient Copán ruins in western Honduras. An indigenous Ch’orti’ Maya, Canan abandoned his lands this year after repeated crop failures – which he attributed to drought and changing weather patterns. “It didn’t rain this year. Last year it didn’t rain,” he said softly. “My maize field didn’t produce a thing. With my expenses, everything we invested, we didn’t have any earnings. There was no harvest.” Desperate and dreaming of the United States, Canan hit the road in early October and joined the migrant caravan. He left behind a wife and three children – ages 16, 14 and 11 – who were forced to abandon school because Canan couldn’t afford to pay for their supplies. “It wasn’t the same before. This is forcing us to emigrate,” he said. “In past years, it rained on time. My plants produced, but there’s no longer any pattern [to the weather].” US Customs and Border Patrol data shows a surge in outward migration from western Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area, said Stephanie Leutert, an expert in Central American migration and security at the University of Texas. Many of those are farmers or agricultural workers who take to the road when coffee-growing is no longer profitable – such as Antonio Lara, 25, from the Honduran city of Ocotepeque, who joined the caravan with his wife and children, aged six and 18 months. “Coffee used to be worth something, but it’s been seven years since there was a decent price,” he said. Lara said he thought that changing weather patterns had a lot to do with the problem, though he also blamed his plight on greedy bosses and coffee dealers. “I didn’t leave my country because I wanted to. I left because I had to,” he said. A third of all employment in Central America is linked to agriculture, so any disruption to farming practices can have devastating consequences. Since around 2012, coffee plants across Central America have been ravaged by an epidemic called leaf rust, which according to some estimates has affected 70% of farms. Normally, the fungus dies when temperatures drop in the evening but warmer nights are allowing it to thrive, said Sam Dupre, a researcher at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. The impact of climate change on the fungus remains in debate, but Dupre said the situation in Guatemala “shows even without a direct climate change link what happens when these global commodities fail”. “One of the things I found was that people, largely because they weren’t able to pay their debts, to get money for food, they started to migrate,” Dupre said. “People were telling me before the coffee leaf rust hit, we didn’t migrate. Now we do. It’s normal.” A study of Central American migrants by the World Food Program last year found that nearly half described themselves as food insecure. The research found an increasing trend of young people moving as a result of knock-on poverty and lack of work. Climate change is bringing more extreme and unpredictable weather to the region: summer rainfall is starting later and has become more irregular. Drought fuelled by El Niño has gripped much of Central America over the past four years, but the period has been occasionally punctuated by disastrous flooding rains. As a result, more than 3 million people have struggled to feed themselves. “Coffee and maize are sensitive to temperature and rainfall changes,” said Albro. “If a coffee crop fails you can’t just turn on a dime and do something else, it takes a long time to recover. There have been several lost crops in a row and it’s caused tremendous hardship for small-scale farming.” Farmers first migrate to urban areas, where they confront a new set of problems, which in turn prompt them to consider an international odyssey. “There’s an internal movement where someone will go to, say, Guatemala City and then perhaps get extorted by a gang and then move to the US,” said Leutert. “When they get here they will say they’ve moved because of violence – but climate change was the exacerbating factor.” More than 50,000 Guatemalan families were apprehended trying to cross the US border in the year to October, double the number of the previous year, according to US Customs and Border Protection. People move for a tangle of different reasons, and climate change’s influence is often far-reaching and yet hard to measure, but the World Bank estimates that warming temperatures and extreme weather will force an estimated 3.9 million climate migrants to flee Central America over the next 30 years. This mass movement of people risks destabilising their home countries and presents a challenge for destinations such as the US. The 1951 UN refugee convention sets out clear criteria for the granting of asylum, such as persecution and war, but climate change is not on the list. With an estimated 150 million to 300 million climate refugees set to be displaced worldwide by 2050, a new international framework will be needed to accommodate them. “If your farm has been dried to a crisp or your home has been inundated with water and you’re fleeing for your life, you’re not much different from any other refugee,” said Michael Doyle, an international relations scholar at Columbia University. “The problem is that other refugees fleeing war qualify for that status, while you don’t.” Doyle is part of a group of academics and advocates pushing for a new treaty that would focus on the needs of displaced people, rather than their exact reason for leaving, in order to cover the expected wave of climate migrants. Any reform of the landmark refugee agreement is “quite unlikely at present”, Doyle said, due to the complexity of such a new arrangement, as well as the rise of nationalist governments in places such as the US. “The president of the US is using migrant caravans as a political wedge issue as a way to get elected,” Doyle said. “If we reopen the 1951 convention, it’s more likely to be weakened than strengthened. We aren’t in a state where reforms, however sensible, can be made. There just isn’t the global statesmanship at the moment, nowhere near it.”"
2018-12-28T19:16:07Z,Channel migrant crossings: who is coming and why?,"Is there a crisis at the border? Home secretary Sajid Javid has declared the rising number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel to be a major incident. Javid has appointed a gold commander to deal with the growing crisis and asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart to discuss the issue. The Home Office said Javid had commissioned detailed options from Border Force about the provision of additional vessels in the Channel, including another Border Force cutter, even if it might encourage more people to try to make the crossing rather than act as a deterrent. How many migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats? The Home Office had initially refused to give official figures on the number of migrants who have crossed the Channel over the past few months, but finally released figures on 31 December 2018. The update stated 539 migrants have attempted to travel to the UK on small boats in 2018. Around 80%, or 434, made their attempts in the last three months of the year. Of these, 227 (42%) were intercepted by the French before they made it to the UK, according to the Home Office. Is this a new trend? Migrants have been crossing the channel on small boats since the beginning of the year but charities agree it is a relatively new route for those desperate to reach the UK. Caroline Gregory, who works with Calais Action, which has been supporting migrants in northern France for the past three years, said migrants attempting to reach the UK often do so by waiting around in Calais before stowing themselves on to lorries and vans travelling across the channel. This is an incredibly dangerous journey that many migrants have died undertaking, she added. Since the Calais refugee camp, which had 10,000 residents at its height, was dismantled in 2016, the British government has invested millions into border security to prevent another refugee camp forming in Calais or any other Channel port. The extra money has gone towards fencing, CCTV and other detection technology in Calais and other ports. It will also be used to help relocate migrants from the port towns to other parts of France. Gregory said this has made it all the more difficult for migrants to smuggle themselves on to UK-bound vans and lorries or stow away on trains and larger ships used by ferry services. It may have displaced migration flows away from moving vehicles to boats. But the route to the UK is also dependent on someone’s financial circumstances. Those who can afford to pay a smuggler to put them on a small boat to cross the Channel have been able to recently take the opportunity to do so, while others are still taking their chances on vans, lorries, trains or larger ships. Why are they coming now? There are a few factors at play. Charities said the recent arrivals were due to intolerable conditions in the camps in France, including police brutality and intimidation, and a growing sense of “now or never” as Brexit and future immigration restrictions loom. Other also suggest smugglers are exploiting new routes to get migrants to the UK. Who is getting on these small boats? There’s been a noticeable number of Iranian migrants getting on small boats to cross the Channel. There has also been a notable spike in the number of Iranian nationals currently in northern France. The Guardian understands 273 Iranians were transferred to migrant reception centres from Calais since August. Many had been picked up attempting to make the crossing from France to the UK. But charities have been observing migrants from a number of countries attempting to cross the Channel, including Afghans. Where are migrants coming from? The migrants are largely travelling from northern France but come from all over the world. Currently, there are between 1,000 and 2,000 people in camps in Calais and Grande-Synthe in France. Josh Hallam, a field manager for Help Refugees, who works in northern France, said: “In Grande-Synthe it’s mostly Kurdish people from Iraq and Iran and smaller groups from Pakistan and Sudan. In Calais, it’s mostly Iraqi Kurds, Iranians, Ethiopians, Eritreans, Afghans and Sudanese.” Why are they not claiming asylum in France? The migrants keen to come to the UK make up a small fraction of migrants in Europe, Gregory said. She added many had a compelling reason drawing them to the UK; they were often keen to reunite with family members and loved ones, already spoke English or felt they would be safer and more likely to succeed in the UK. Hallam, who has worked with migrants for the past couple of years, said conditions in northern France are the worst he has ever seen. He said the police have conducted regular raids on the encampments where they have destroyed tents, disposed of people’s personal belongings and even pepper sprayed families and young unaccompanied minors in attempts to disperse them. “Migrants and asylum seekers have been completely scarred by their experiences here,” he said, adding many were not keen to seek asylum in a country where they have been treated so poorly."
2018-12-20T13:44:25Z,Spanish rescuers find 11 dead migrants on boat near Almería,"Spain’s maritime rescue service has found the bodies of 11 people, among them a pregnant woman, on a small boat off the country’s southern coast. The discovery came at the end of a two-day search for the migrant boat and its 55 passengers, who had gone missing about 11 miles (18km) south of the city of Almería. A spokeswoman for the rescue service told the Associated Press that a Spanish navy scientific research vessel had found the drifting boat in the area, east of the strait of Gibraltar, in the early hours of Thursday. Twenty-nine men and four women were still alive onboard, but one of the men later died in a hospital in Almería. Another 11 people remained missing. The service has also been looking for three more boats in the Alboran Sea, two of them carrying more than 55 migrants each. The Almería branch of the Spanish Red Cross called it a “sad and tragic day”, adding that the survivors and the bodies of the dead had been brought into the city’s port. According to local government officials, three young men were still under observation in hospital. Figures from the International Organization for Migration showed more than 55,200 migrants and refugees had reached Spain by sea so far this year, while 743 died in the attempt. “Already this month, more men, women and children have arrived via sea from North Africa than did in any of the year’s first four months,” the IOM said in a recent bulletin. “Migrant sea arrivals to Spain have exceeded 150 per day since 1 November. For the first third of 2018, Spain’s average was under 40 arrivals per day.” The record number of arrivals to Spain – partly driven by the closure of other European routes – has placed huge strains on the country’s migrant reception infrastructure."
2018-10-15T06:00:26Z,Hate speech has silenced the voices of those risking death on Europe's seas | Regina Catrambone,"According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), at least 1,778 people have perished this year in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the world’s deadliest migratory route. But European political leaders rarely mention this figure as they celebrate the results of their current migration policies. This is the highest percentage of fatalities ever recorded along this route. Since last year, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been represented increasingly as numbers, their ordeals under-reported or minimised, their lives used as statistics, not flesh and blood. But when the official narrative is limited to numbers and figures, people disappear. So what’s happening to vulnerable mothers and children stranded, for instance, in Libya? What about elderly people? Who is taking care of them? Are medical conditions being treated? Violence in Libya has escalated recently, further exacerbating a volatile environment that puts at stake the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people trapped amid chaos. There are a number of detention centres, the locations of which vary, where access is mostly forbidden to humanitarian organisations. The UN has often declared that working in Libya is extremely difficult and dangerous, and its staff on the ground can’t cover all humanitarian needs. Last December, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) could see at first-hand the dangers of the situation on the ground and assisted the UNHCR’s staff during an evacuation flight to Niger, where 51 children, 22 women and one man found shelter after a long stay in Libya. Nonetheless, the resettlement plan didn’t work as expected, and many people are still waiting to start their new life in another country. As migration flows intensified in 2013, public opinion showed indignation and empathy, political leaders promised to take immediate action to prevent further deaths and humanitarian organisations consolidated more efficient patterns to welcome rescued people at disembarkation ports. All eyes were focused on the survivors of desperate journeys, but the sea was still killing an unknown number of children, women and men. At that time, Moas was created to mitigate the loss of life and to allow journalists to document what it meant to be in distress out at sea. The impact of these life-saving search-and-rescues was unparalleled for three main reasons: fewer and fewer people died, journalists joined us and we gave voice to the rescued. But, our missions were not limited to rescue. We also provided post-rescue care to migrants and refugees. During their time spent on board, the people rescued didn’t receive only food, water, clothes and blankets, but also comfort and care from the Moas team. No one could say they didn’t know what was going on out at sea. Our mission helped people to share their stories – of trafficking and of hope. Now, it’s all over. Since the end of 2016, the process of dehumanisation has progressively escalated, its peak coming in 2017 when fake news and hate speech reinforced a criminalisation of solidarity. The lack of European empathy and the failure of relocation schemes profoundly changed the way we can operate, and reduced the capacity to perform rescues at sea. Almost all humanitarian boats were forced to suspend or redeploy their missions elsewhere. Merchant ships no longer perform rescues because, they say, they are afraid of being left adrift while waiting to be notified of a disembarkation port while those who survive almost fade away. The evolution of migration flows and policies has constantly silenced the voices of migrants and refugees. We have never known so little about them. Official figures are likely to be underestimates, so we don’t know how many people perish crossing the desert or the sea. We fail to help them if they end up in Libya and we neglect their lives when they step off the boat. They become invisible because we talk about them, but never talk to them, to listen to their stories. It’s easy to dehumanise people whose lives, faces and dreams are unknown. We don’t need much strength to offend and be cruel about people who are just represented by a number. Numbers don’t have feelings, scars or wounds. But behind those figures there is a person with flesh and bone, with dreams and a soul, in search of a peaceful future.

2018-12-05T22:00:13Z,"Conflicts and poverty drive big jump in global migration, finds report","Rising instances of conflict and poverty have propelled a 20% increase in the number of international migrants over the space of four years, according to a major report from the UN showing the scale of global migration. According to the UN’s International Labour Organization the total number of people who left their home country in search of work, to join family, or to flee conflicts and persecution increased to 277 million last year from 232 million in 2013. In what is the most authoritative attempt so far to chronicle the growing number of people on the move across the planet, the ILO said rising levels of inequality in many parts of the world were having a significant impact, which governments could not ignore by adopting populist policies. Manuela Tomei, the director of the ILO’s conditions of work and equality department, told the Guardian that migration was becoming a “defining feature” of the modern world and that the issues it posed could not be solved by individual nations acting alone. “The way in which migration and labour migration in particular has been dealt with until now is a recipe for disaster. There is a need to place it seriously and highly on the global agenda,” she said. The report comes as support rises for rightwing populist parties in several major economies around the world, fuelled by anti-immigrant sentiment and the hollowing out of the middle class from weak wage growth and austerity policies used after the global financial crisis. Tomei said that scapegoating migrants and imposing tougher border controls was not the answer to solving the socioeconomic and political pressures posed by rising levels of migration, adding that the ILO’s work was carried out to bring facts to a debate that often relies on perceptions and misinformation. “If you’re saying there are hordes of migrants that are invading us, and the numbers are unrelated to reality, this may trigger a syndrome of anxiety and insecurity and the response would be ‘let’s keep them out’,” she said. Some of the increase in the number of international migrants is down to a rising world population, which is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and the better quality of data used to make the ILO’s estimates. However, the organisation did single out the impact from rising inequality and a growing number of conflicts around the world, such as the war in Syria, as well as droughts and other environmental issues. Of the 277 million, 19 million are refugees, 234 million are over the age of 15, and 164 million are workers, according to the ILO estimates, with a particular rise for people moving to improve their economic life chances. Migrant workers were found to overwhelmingly move to wealthier nations, with three-fifths of all migrants concentrated in three regions: North America (23%), south and west Europe (24%) and the Arab states (14%). Arab countries had the largest percentage of migrant workers as a proportion of their overall workforce and had seen big increases in arrivals in recent years as more workers moved to work in major cities like Dubai, Riyadh and Doha, which are experiencing building booms. Across nine out of 11 regions analysed by the ILO, the percentage of migrants in work was higher than that of the local population, showing that when people move abroad they tend to do so for work, rather than other reasons. Migration due to rising inequality comes after the World Bank estimated that almost half of the world’s population – 3.4 billion people – live on less than $5.50 (£4.30) a day, and struggle to meet basic needs. Tomei said: “The widening of income inequalities within countries, and among countries, is a very, very important factor in explaining the reason why so many millions of people are moving across borders to find better working and living conditions.”"
2018-11-13T08:00:01Z,Venezuelan migrants live in shadows on Caribbean's sunshine islands,"Sunburned European holidaymakers amble around the island’s colonial capital or lie sprawled on lounge chairs. From Curaçao’s postcard-perfect beaches you can sometimes see the coast of Venezuela, but tourists enjoying the sun are unlikely to see many of the thousands of Venezuelans who live here. Angélica Morales, 37, barely leaves her cramped apartment in the capital, Willemstad: like thousands of undocumented migrants, she lives in constant fear of the police. “We have to be hidden. This is the life of the illegals here in Curaçao,” said Angélica, who – like other migrants on the island interviewed for this story – asked to be identified by a pseudonym. Political repression, violent crime and economic collapse have caused at least 3 million Venezuelans – more than 9% of the country’s population – to flee their home since 2015, in an exodus without precedent in Latin America. The crisis has created challenges for countries across South America, where opportunities for migrants are scarce, even when they are granted political asylum. And due to their geographical proximity, the Caribbean islands have found themselves of the frontline of the emergency: Curaçao lies 40 miles off the Venezuelan coast while Trinidad is just seven miles from the mainland. Accurate statistics are hard to come by, but more than 100,000 Venezuelans have fled to the Caribbean islands. At least 40,000 have gone to Trinidad and Tobago, some 28,500 are in the Dominican Republic and 16,000 have gone to Aruba. The numbers are a fraction of those seen in mainland South America – Colombia has received more than a million migrants – but few of the territories in the region have the infrastructure to cope with such an influx and most have responded to the crisis by simply deporting any Venezuelans they can. As the number of refugees increases, so does xenophobia and exploitation. In August, an angry mob destroyed a migrant camp in Brazil, and while such attacks have not been reported in the Caribbean, migrants have described a climate of hostility and official harassment. Unable to find legal employment, they are forced to work in the black economy; female migrants have been forced into sex work across the region. Some 16,000 Venezuelans are living illegally in Curaçao – equivalent to 10% of the island’s population. “No matter how small the flow is, we’re still talking about a significant percentage of the local population,” said Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, a DC-based thinktank. A Venezuelan man sitting near a tourist beach on Curaçao put it another way: “The problem is not that people are eating from the trash in Venezuela, but that there’s not even enough trash for everyone.” Venezuelans either enter as tourists and overstay their visa, or risk the dangerous sea journey in small boats; most consider themselves refugees, but Curaçao treats them as economic migrants. “Unfortunately, in many countries [in the region] even refugees in need of protection are received as economic migrants. But the truth is that many of these people have humanitarian needs that go beyond those of more traditional economic migrants,” said Ramsey. And according to Amnesty International, even people who would qualify for refugee status are unable to claim asylum in Curaçao: under the island’s “active removal strategy” Venezuelans with irregular migration status are deported – in breach of international law. In 2017, 1,203 Venezuelans were thrown out, often after being forced to pay for their own flights. Curaçao, a former Dutch colony, is one of four territories which constitute the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and although it is not part of the European Union it is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, which forbids deportations to countries where individuals face a serious risk of torture and abuse. This week, the Dutch state secretary of kingdom affairs, Raymond Knops, said the government would not investigate Curaçao's treatment of Venezuelan migrants. Fear of deportation prevents people with an apparently clearcut case from even attempting to claim asylum. Hernán Murillo, a former member of the internal affairs department of Venezuela’s military counterintelligence agency, fled home two years ago after he witnessed colleagues commit three killings and uncovered evidence implicating army officers in fraud schemes. “They threatened to kill me,” Murillo exclaims. “Instead of taking action against [the corrupt officers], they took action against me.” After two years in Curaçao, he has still not dared apply for political asylum, because he assumes he will be arrested and deported. Instead, he finds odd jobs on building sites and in bakeries, sending a few dollars back to his family each month. He has good reason to be fearful: migrants who are caught by the police are held in police cells or detention centres until they are deported – often in “inhumane” conditions, said Mary Anne Goiri who represents Venex, an association of Venezuelans on Curaçao. “They are treated as criminals while not having committed a crime,” said Goiri. By far the most popular Caribbean island destination is the twin island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which lies almost within swimming distance of Venezuela’s west coast. Carlos González was an investigative journalist in Monagas, Venezuela, until he was blacklisted and threatened after reporting on the black market in subsidized food products. Now he works in a supermarket where he gave an interview while stocking the shelves with breakfast cereal. If detained by Trinidadian authorities, he risks being jailed, fined or sent back to Venezuela. In April, Trinidad and Tobago deported 82 Venezuelan asylum applicants, in violation of international refugee law. “This country will not allow the United Nations or any other international body to convert it into a refugee camp,” said the prime minister, Keith Rowley. Since then the government has promised new legislation on asylum seekers, but it has yet to emerge. “We live in a judicial limbo: we have no way to legally support ourselves here,” said González. “I feel that I came from a country where I do not have rights, but here I’m also without rights.” Cultural differences in the former British colony can be jarring for migrants, who struggle with English, right-hand drive cars and cricket. Security is also an issue: Venezuelans leave behind a country judged to be the second most dangerous in the world, but Trinidad and Tobago is only 10 places below that, and undocumented refugees are both targets and recruits for the islands’ gangs.“As long as the borders remain porous, more Venezuelans are going to come,” said the Roman Catholic archbishop of Port of Spain, Jason Gordon, who argues that instead of shunning migrants, Trinidad and Tobago should help them use their skills to build the economy. “This is an issue that affects every citizen of the island.”"
2018-11-20T12:37:53Z,Libya: child refugees abused in UK-funded detention centres,"Child refugees are facing abuse and malnutrition in a network of 26 Libyan detention centres the British government is helping to fund, the Guardian has learned. In the first accounts to the media from minors being held in the camps, the children described being starved, beaten and abused by Libyan police and camp guards. One said the conditions were like “hell on earth”. According to documents seen by the Guardian, there are 26 active camps which are part-funded by the UK across Libya. While the existence of the camps had previously been reported, the scale of the network was not public. There are no exact figures available on the number of children being held but there are thought to be hundreds and possibly more than 1,000. There are at least 5,400 refugees and migrants being detained in total, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says. The Department for International Development confirmed the government was contributing funds for the centres: “We continue to help fund the European Union Trust Fund’s work to improve conditions for migrants in detention centres.” The government insists the funding is necessary as part of a humane effort to dissuade people from making the dangerous Mediterranean crossing. Arguing that migrant detention centres are the responsibility of the Libyan authorities, it is understood to have raised concerns over the treatment of detainees with the Libyan government. But critics see the Libyan camps as a way for European countries to outsource their problem with migrants and asylum seekers and contend that they are implicated in the problems with a system they fund “to make sure they don’t get to Europe”. The revelations from the children – who risk severe punishment if guards discover they have been speaking to the media – provide the most detailed account yet of life in the camps for minors. Earlier this month, Amnesty International said conditions in the detention centres were unsustainable and that torture and ill-treatment were rife. “There is a callous disregard on the part of Europe and other states for the suffering of those languishing in detention centres,” the Amnesty report said. A 16-year-old boy in one of the centres said: “I have been here for four months. I have tried to escape three times to cross the sea to Italy but each time I have been caught and brought back to the detention centre. We are dying here but no one is taking responsibility. We need to be taken to a place of safety but we are locked in here 24 hours a day. We do not see sunrise and we do not see sunset.” The centres are designed to keep asylum seekers from crossing the Mediterranean to Europe. The UK and other EU countries have spent tens of millions trying to prevent asylum seekers from conflict zones, such as Eritrea and Sudan, entering the region. Last year the UK government spent £10m in Libya on various initiatives, including the detention centres. Critics see the work as part of the government’s former “hostile environment” migration policy, intended to deter people from seeking sanctuary in the UK as well as removing those who were already in the country. A 13-year-old Eritrean asylum seeker in a Tripoli camp told the Guardian detainees got just one or two small portions of white pasta a day and many were starving and malnourished. Diseases such as TB were rife. Many possessed just one T-shirt and one pair of shorts and were freezing now temperatures were dropping. “I am very scared and very hungry,” the boy said. “I want to reach the UK where I will be safe. We have nothing here, no food, no clothes, no phones. I miss my mother and father so much.” A 30-year-old Eritrean asylum seeker in the camp said the boy had travelled from Eritrea via Sudan with a 16-year-old cousin. “He cries all the time for his parents,” she said. “He is so sad I let him go to sleep with me. The conditions here are so bad. We are treated like donkeys, not like human beings. We are not allowed to have phones so we have to hide them when the police come.” This week a 24-year-old refugee tried to hang himself in the toilet area of one of the camps, a 16-year-old in the same camp said. Three others saw him and quickly cut him down. He survived. The teenager said his friend had lost hope because he was registered with UNHCR in January 2018 but was still languishing in the detention centres. In a message sent late on Monday evening he said: “All the refugees are waiting to do like what our bro do cos they suffered long time. Libya is hell on earth. The world never help us and see our problem.” One 17-year-old Eritrean boy who escaped from a detention centre and reached the UK has claimed asylum. An expert medical report found almost 50 torture scars on his body, consistent with being beaten with batonsand sticks. In a witness statement the boy said some of the injuries were sustained in beatings from guards at the camp, and others from traffickers. Many of those in the camps are from Eritrea but there are also asylum seekers from Ethiopia, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan and Syria. The policy to keep out as many asylum seekers as possible by holding them at key crossing points into Europe appears to be working. In the year ending March 2018, the number of asylum applications in the UK from main applicants decreased by 8% to 26,547. The falls are consistent with the wider trend across Europe, with a decrease of around 41% in applications to EU countries in the last year. Giulia Tranchina, of Wilsons solicitors, who is representing the 17-year-old Eritrean boy in London, said: “What young men, women, children and babies are suffering in detention in Libya is one of the biggest failures of our human civilisation. European governments, in our name, with our taxpayers’ money, are paying Libyan authorities, militias and army generals to continue detaining and torturing refugees on our behalf, to make sure they don’t get to Europe.” A spokeswoman for UNHCR said: “We remain incredibly concerned about the plight of detained refugees and migrants. Conditions in detention are extremely dire.” She said the current figure of 5,409 refugees and migrants being detained in Libya did not include those being held captive by smugglers. A DfID spokeswoman said government funding was also used to encourage migrants to return to their home countries, for emergency evacuations of refugees, and for healthcare. UK government officials had raised with their counterparts in the Libyan Government of National Accord the need to respect the human rights of migrants, ensure the provision of basic services and explore alternatives to detention centres, she said."
2018-11-18T10:35:10Z,'Lesbos deserves better': pioneering aid project unites locals and migrants,"An air of optimism hovers over the olive grove. Men from Africa, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq are busy building a wooden structure that will serve as a new shelter. There is quiet concentration, banter and even a bit of laughter as they bang nails into the beams. The scene is a far cry from the chaos of the adjacent refugee camp, a place so congested it has earned the Greek island of Lesbos the unenviable reputation of being home to the worst migrant facility in Europe. “When people live in a structured environment, they behave in a structured way,” says Adil Izemrane matter-of-factly. The Dutch humanitarian is on a double mission, one that is as much “about host as hosted”. “Our aim is to create jobs and new economies that benefit both.” The olive grove is an experiment in “model living”. The wood for the shelter, like the cement, stones and mesh used to terrace this once chaotic strip of land – occupied in the spillover from the main camp – have been acquired from Moria, the hillside village up the road. The hope is that the collaboration will enable fraternisation between locals and refugees at a time of rising resentment, anger and fear on the island. “People here showed such resilience, such generosity in such overwhelming circumstances, they deserve better,” says the 41-year-old, whose group, Movement on the Ground, has set itself the goal of taming the ills that have inflamed passions. “They deserve support.” Three years have elapsed since a million men, woman and children landed on Lesbos in the largest movement of humanity since the second world war. Initially kindness and compassion prevailed, virtues that were rewarded on Saturday when islanders received the inaugural John McCain award “for their heroic support of refugees fleeing mayhem throughout the Middle East and Africa”. Announcing the prize, the late US politician’s widow, Cindy, said she hoped recognition of the “sacrifices that so many ordinary people have made” would inspire others to “stand up for what is right”. But the outpouring of sympathy witnessed at the height of the drama has given way to darker sentiments – born, Izemrane believes, of policies that were ultimately misguided. Emergency aid was tailored exclusively to those landing on Lesbos’s shores. Locals, he says, were overlooked. In neglecting their concerns, the seeds were sown for antipathy and intolerance towards refugees – sentiments exploited by an ascendant right and echoed across Europe by fear-mongering politicians. “In the end what we saw on this island was an invasion of good intention,” he says. “By only focusing on the refugees and not the local community who were just as much a part of the crisis, it created polarisation.” It falls to Nikos Trakellis, a jocular man in his early fifties who is president of Moria’s 1,100-strong community, to handle the toxic mix of emotions among his compatriots. No place in Greece, he laments, experiences the migrant crisis as close up. “Every day there’s some incident, it might be a [farm] animal being stolen, a car being damaged, a house or shop being broken into, a fire,” he explains. “It’s hard. We’ve already suffered a lot from the economic crisis in this country.” Despite the onset of winter, people keep coming, traversing the sea that separates Greece’s easterly Aegean islands from the Turkish coast. At least 70 men, women and children arrive in Lesbos daily although often that number swells into the hundreds. Newcomers, invariably, are taken up through the hills to Moria and the malodorous barbed-wire topped detention centre that stands barely two kilometres from the village in a former army barracks. Periodic attempts to reduce numbers – the camp is currently home to nearly 10,000 people, more than three times its capacity – are greeted wanly in the face of constant arrivals. In conditions repeatedly described as deplorable and depraved, stories of despair are rife. “They are people, just like us, who have mothers and fathers but before [the refugee crisis] we weren’t the victims of plunder and theft,” says Trakellis. “Today, villagers are afraid to walk the streets after dark, they no longer feel safe even in their homes. So far, there’s been no physical violence but as long as [refugees] are trapped in that camp, there is the chance that - ‘bam!’ – the whole place will go up.” Izemrane, himself the son of Dutch-Moroccan immigrants, was among the wave of idealists who felt compelled to move to Lesbos in 2015 after being shocked by the image of the Syrian toddler, Alan Kurdi, lying limp and lifeless on a Turkish beach. He arrived with his “giving food” truck exactly one month later. But experience has taught him that such assistance is no longer relevant in a drama of shifting tones. These days, Movement on the Ground operates more like a tech start-up than a traditional aid organisation, believing that if refugees are seen solely as victims of war, without a sense of purpose or ability to re-engage in social life, it will keep them in survival mode and cut any chance of integration. For Izemrane the path forward lies in little things. At the olive grove priority has been to given to providing basic services, installing internet access and running water, as well as instilling a sense of order. Overnight, he says, fights in food queues stopped when the queues were abolished and appointees from tents were assigned the job of fetching food. To defuse tensions refugees are dispatched weekly to clean the waste trail often left around the village. But it is jobs that the NGO is intent on creating. Some 47,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Greece in the first ten months of this year, 37 % more than a year ago, according to the European border agency, Frontex. Although most asylum seekers on Lesbos will eventually leave – if their requests aren’t rejected and they are returned to Turkey – the vast majority will likely remain in Greece, making the need for literacy, numeracy and other skills imperative to integration. On an island with an unemployment rate of 25%, the Dutch group has employed ten locals, including teachers and sports coaches, who oversee computer classes, English classes and football training both for unaccompanied minors and the children of low-income locals. In an office building in the heart of Mytilene, Antonis Zeivekis teaches young refugees how to navigate the web as part of one of the group’s outreach programs. “I teach them to teach each other and it’s extremely rewarding,” says the previously unemployed Greek mathematician, 25, posing for a picture with his Burundi student, Kwizera. The approach that has been so successful in a region still regarded as the frontline of the refugee drama that European officials would like to see it replicated elsewhere. In an age of rage many hope policies of inclusion and integration will ultimately take the sting out of the resentment that permits populism to thrive. “Including host communities, as is being done here, is the only sustainable way forward,” says Manon Albert, who focuses on migration policy at the Dutch embassy in Athens. “We are looking into ways to reproduce [this approach] in other parts of Greece.” • This article was amended on 21 November 2018. An earlier version said that according to Frontex, “over 40,000 refugees have arrived in Greece this year – 150% more than last year”. Frontex’s figures show that 47,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Greece in the first ten months of this year, 37% more than a year ago."
2018-12-16T20:05:23Z,Anti-migrant protesters clash with police in Brussels,"At least 90 people have been arrested after anti-migration protesters clashed with police outside EU institutions in Brussels. Authorities fired teargas and used water cannon as around 5,500 people demonstrated against a UN migration pact signed last week in Marrakech, Morocco, at a rally organised by the Belgian far-right party Vlaams Belang. The non-binding international agreement to manage the global migration crisis has proven politically divisive in Belgium, prompting ministers from a Flemish nationalist party to quit the government last week. Authorities broke up the demonstration after firecrackers and projectiles were thrown on Sunday, according to reporters on the ground. A counter-rally, which drew around 1,000 protesters, and the anti-migration demonstration had initially been banned by Belgian authorities over fears of unrest, but the country’s supreme administrative court overturned the decision. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, was given permission to form a minority administration following the resignations of ministers from the New Flemish Alliance over the UN migration pact. The pact was agreed in July by all 193 UN members except the US, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting last Monday."
2018-12-05T23:30:15Z,Myths about migrants spreading disease 'inform hostile policies',"Myths that migrants are responsible for spreading disease and a burden to health services have been used in support of the hostile and restrictive policies introduced in the US, UK and elsewhere around the world, a two-year commission has concluded. The commission of 20 experts, set up by University College London and the Lancet medical journal, started work as Brexit became all-consuming in the UK and the US president, Donald Trump, stepped up border controls and demanded a wall between the US and Mexico. But the rhetoric that migration damages health and healthcare has been around for a long time – and is wrong, said the chair of the group, Prof Ibrahim Abubakar from UCL. Abubakar, who used to be head of the tuberculosis unit at Public Health England, said his photograph was used years ago on the British National party website “to illustrate a point which is frankly untrue. Whenever we published our TB figures, they extracted the bit that says X proportion is among migrants and created fear stories along the lines of migrants are spreading these bugs”. The evidence shows that the risk of migrants transmitting TB to their host communities is low, the commission says. Their analysis shows that migrants who are usually working, studying or have joined their families often have better health than the general population. The study used mortality estimates on more than 15.2 million migrants from 92 countries and found that international migrants had lower rates of deaths for cardiovascular, digestive, endocrine, neoplasms, nervous and respiratory diseases, mental and behavioural disorders and injuries than people in the general population in the receiving country. There was no evidence of a difference for blood, genitourinary, or musculoskeletal disorders. “We come to the conclusion that there is no evidence migrants are contributing to any harmful effects on the health of the countries. If anything, they are adding a lot of value,” said Abubakar. There were more than a billion people on the move in 2018, a quarter of whom were crossing international borders, says the commission. About 65% are labour migrants. “Populist discourse demonises the very same individuals who uphold economies and bolster social care and health services,” he said. “Questioning the deservingness of migrants for healthcare on the basis of inaccurate beliefs supports practices of exclusion, harming the health of individuals, our society, and our economies.” While he understood NHS funding and the need to assess entitlement, “as a medic, the last thing I’d want in this world is to be sitting in a clinic and to have to take decisions about whether an individual should get treatment for a life-threatening illness based on their immigration status”. The NHS had a memorandum of understanding to share immigration details of patients with the Home Office. It set up a “perverse incentive” to shun healthcare. “If I was sitting in a vulnerable position and I’m aware that if I present with early symptoms of a particular disease that might lead to my deportation, the logical reaction would be not to show up and the consequence of that is awful for the migrant, it’s awful for UK public health and the taxpayer,” said Abubakar. This year, the memorandum was altered so that it no longer applies to individuals suspected of immigration offences – only those with serious criminal convictions. But in the US, the Trump administration has plans to take into account whether individuals have utilised social health insurance schemes when decisions are taken on residency. “That’s as powerful an incentive as the hostile environment. That would discourage people from accessing healthcare because they are trying to guard against a future immigration decision,” said Abubakar. While high-income countries have seen a greater rise in the percentage of international migrants (from 7.6% in 1990 to 13.4% in 2017), those migrants are more likely to be students who pay for their education or labour migrants who are net contributors to the economy. Refugees make up a larger proportion of the total population in low-income countries compared with high-income countries (0.7% v 0.2%). “In too many countries, the issue of migration is used to divide societies and advance a populist agenda,” said the Lancet’s editor, Dr Richard Horton. Prof Cathy Zimmerman, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and senior author of the report, said: “Governments around the world are well aware that their economies depend on migrant workers, both for low-wage work in destination countries and for remittances in sending countries. Yet, states have done disappointingly little to assure the health and safety of migrant workers, or to stop the exploitation and human trafficking of millions of hard-working women and men who toil invisibly in every corner of the globe. “Low-wage workers must stop being treated as disposable and be offered adequate numbers of work visas that are fair and not tied to employers or to extortionate labour brokers. Until states stop siding with employers over migrant workers, individuals around the world will remain vulnerable to 3D jobs: dirty, dangerous and demeaning.”"
2018-11-21T00:34:49Z,"Australia refuses to sign UN migration pact, citing risks to turnbacks and detention","The Morrison government has confirmed it will not sign up to the United Nation’s migration pact, claiming it will undermine Australia’s harsh policies to deter asylum seekers despite Australia’s role in helping to draft it. The Refugee Council of Australia and advocates have strongly rejected the government’s claim, citing the fact the compact is non-binding and has a provision stating that countries retain sovereignty over their migration programs. Labor offered a mixed reaction to the announcement, with defence spokesman Richard Marles suggesting Labor would “work with the global community” on migration, while opposition leader Bill Shorten said he was “not fussed” about the decision and would decide after taking advice in government. In July the Coalition signalled it would refuse to sign the agreement, because the final draft of the compact said that migration detention should only be used “as a measure of last resort” and states should work towards alternatives. After failing to secure changes addressing its concerns, the Morrison government confirmed on Wednesday that Australia will not sign, joining the United States, Israel and a group of Eastern European countries that have also refused. The announcement comes after Scott Morrison signalled that Australia will reduce its migration cap from 190,000, all but confirming on Wednesday the 2019 budget will reduce the cap. The global compact aims to address migration issues in a “safe, orderly and regular” way through a “collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration”. The final draft includes a commitment to review legislation and policies to ensure “migrants are not detained arbitrarily, that decisions to detain are based on law, are proportionate, have a legitimate purpose, and are taken on an individual basis, in full compliance with due process and procedural safeguards, and that immigration detention is not promoted as a deterrent or used as a form of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment to migrants, in accordance with international human rights law”. It states that refugees and migrants “are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times”. The compact nevertheless “reaffirms the sovereign right of states to determine their national migration policy … in conformity with international law”. Australia runs offshore detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru designed to deter people from coming to Australia by boat to claim asylum and turns back boats at sea, a practice the UN has said is illegal under international law and “may intentionally put lives at risk”. In a joint statement prime minister Scott Morrison, home affairs minister Peter Dutton and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne said the government believed the compact is “inconsistent with our well-established policies and not in Australia’s interest”. The trio said Australia “already achieves” the goals of safe, orderly and regular migration and the compact would “directly conflict with important principles that have underpinned our successful approach”. They warned the compact would “risk encouraging illegal entry to Australia and reverse Australia’s hard-won successes in combating the people-smuggling trade”. “The compact fails to adequately distinguish between people who enter Australia illegally and those who come to Australia the right way, particularly with respect to the provision of welfare and other benefits.” Refugee Council of Australia chief executive Paul Power said the compact recognised both the rights of migrants and the right of sovereign states to set their own policy. He noted that the Australian government had “been very active, having considerable influence over the wording of the global compact”. “In refusing to sign the compact, Australia will join a small group of governments which are each trying to appeal to or appease minority far-right political movements within their countries,” Power said. “It is hard to see the Australian government’s decision as anything other than posturing for some political gain, as the facts do not align with the prime minister’s claims.” Carolina Gottardo, the director of Jesuit Refugee Service Australia who participated in negotiations of the compact as a member of the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, told Guardian Australia that Australia helped water down the compact. Gottardo accused the Morrison government of “misinformation” and a “political game” for having argued for stronger protections of sovereignty, only to refuse to sign the non-binding compact on the grounds it harmed sovereignty. “The final compact is a major achievement, it is measured and constructive. “It’s a non-binding agreement of great normative importance that does not threaten border protection or efforts to stop people smuggling.” Save the Children director of policy and international programs Mat Tinkler called on the government to “work toward global solutions” to the migration crisis. Dutton told Sky News that the Coalition government had “stopped drownings at sea and boat arrivals”. “And we’re not going to surrender that – we want our sovereignty to stay intact,” he said. “We’re concerned about the way in which [the compact] might be interpreted by the courts here. “We’re concerned about whether or not it starves us … of the ability to decide the way in which we can return people. Under the compact certain obligations could be imposed where we needed to support people once they’d been returned to a country of origin.” Both Morrison and Dutton ruled out Australia withdrawing from a separate UN refugee compact. Morrison told 2GB Radio the government had announced “a fair-dinkum process” to review Australia’s migration levels in consultation with the states and territories. “The migration program is set a year in advance,” he said. “This year’s program is already set. “We’re going to have to make a decision in next year’s budget for the program that follows that.” Australia accepted just 162,417 permanent migrants in the past year, a figure which is already almost 30,000 a year below the current cap."
2018-10-20T17:25:39Z,Trapped at the border: the forlorn Hondurans hoping to reach the US,"Dozens of Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence abandoned their efforts to cross through Mexico to the US amid mounting fear and exhaustion, more than a week into the gruelling journey north. As many as 4,000 Hondurans, including pregnant women and children, remain trapped at the Guatemala-Mexico border awaiting permission to continue the long journey to the US. The caravan of thousands started as 160 people nine days ago but its numbers have swelled as more have joined in an attempt to leave poverty and violence behind them. Now a minority have turned back, using transport organised by Guatemalan security forces. “I’m going back because I’ve had enough, and this might be my only chance to go back safely, guarded by policemen,” said 17-year-old Byron Espina from Copán. Espina worked as a coffee picker in a small village called La Entrada, making only pennies, he said, and had hoped to find work in the US. Free buses started arriving late on Friday night, just hours after Mexican riot police had hurled teargas bombs into the frustrated crowd after some migrants broke through a riot-shield cordon to enter Mexican territory. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, said on Saturday that the caravan of people could seek asylum or enter with the right travel documents, but “irregular entry” would not be tolerated. Fearing further repression and long delays, some started boarding the buses destined for the Honduran border town Agua Caliente, where police have stopped hundreds of migrants from leaving the country to join the exodus north. The escalating intervention by security forces is seen as a direct response to threats by President Trump to cut off millions of dollars of aid to Central America and Mexico if they fail to stop the caravan – the second this year – reaching the US border. Migration is not a crime, and a regional agreement allows free movement for citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua travelling with national ID cards. The director of the Americas for Amnesty International, Erika Guevara Rosas, tweeted: “Honduran migrant caravan is not a security threat, but an act of survival by 100s of people escaping extreme violence, poverty, exclusion, and the inability of their government to protect their rights. The response to this human drama should be one of solidarity and compassion.” The migrants and refugees are mostly fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption. On Friday night at least eight people were killed during shooting in a bar in Tegucigalpa, Honduras’s capital, one of dozens of similar incidents so far this year. Fewer than one in 10 crimes are prosecuted. Honduras is the most unequal country in the region: two-thirds of people live in poverty. The bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico over the Suchiate river has become a makeshift refugee camp, with thousands of people, including entire families, forced to sleep, eat, and play outside, just metres from growing piles of rubbish. Despite the risks, most are determined to continue. “This uncertainty is part of the trip,” said Fresbindo Carvajal, 24, from Tegucigalpa, who walks with a cane due to a congenital defect in one leg. “I’m still on my way up. No doubt. It’s better to suffer for a moment than a whole lifetime. And if we go back to Honduras we’ll suffer until the day we die. Even if we have to survive on beans and coffee, I’m going.” Protests in support of migration have broken out in cities across Honduras, including outside the US embassy in Tegucigalpa where journalist and ex-congressman Bartolo Fuentes – who was illegally detained and deported from Guatemala last week while accompanying the caravan – spoke to the crowd. “I have seen mothers cry about the bodies of their children. Parents receive the coffins. I hope this stops. Meanwhile, we must accompany our fellow countrymen,” he said on Friday. Marta Sánchez, founder of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, which organises an annual caravan of mothers searching for their children who disappeared while trying to reach the US, said: “This is not a caravan, it’s an exodus. “It’s a popular uprising against the government by people who can take no more of the terrible conditions in Honduras. I’ve never seen anything like it.”"
2018-12-08T09:00:41Z,'I don't want to go back': what's next for the Central American migrant caravan?,"Inside the Tijuana migrant shelter that has become a home for thousands of Central American migrants, 55-year-old Carlos Gómez approached some strangers asking if they knew where he could find a job. Gómez was one of thousands who fled Honduras with the migrant caravan that arrived in Tijuana one month ago. He would still like to seek asylum in the US, but with thousands of people ahead of him in the line to submit an application, he would be content to stay in Mexico, he says. “I need the work, I don’t want to go back to Honduras,” said Gómez in El Barretal’s enormous open courtyard, where the few spaces not occupied by tents are filled with lines of people waiting to receive donated sandwiches and piles of warm winter clothes. Despite the open hostility of Donald Trump, most members of the recent migrant caravans headed north in the belief – fed by rumors and often bolstered by their deep Christian faith – that they would quickly be granted asylum. Now, after a cold welcome in Tijuana – where they have faced xenophobic reactions from local people and been teargassed by US border officials – some migrants have chosen to head home. But most have remained in Tijuana, intent on building a life more tenable than one defined by the violence and unrest back home. Gómez made the 2,000-mile journey to Mexico alone, after his family was forced off their property and targeted by gangs. “I couldn’t live in that country anymore,” he said. He accepted the Mexican government’s offer to provide work permits to the migrants but said he had been waiting two weeks for his application to be processed. Until that happens, Gómez – along with thousands of others – remains at Barretal, a concert hall turned refugee camp. The migrants were transferred here last week after a previous facility – a sports center – was flooded during torrential rains and health workers warned of dangerous, unsanitary conditions. In Barretal’s multi-story indoor facility, children’s chatter bounces off the walls endlessly as kids stampede down staircases and through corridors, turning any structure, including the music venue bar, into a playground. Adults hold hushed conversations, rustle through backpacks and suitcases to find a certain shirt or hat and empty plastic bags of donated bathroom supplies to examine on their blankets. Denis, 31, said the only quiet in the camp came late at night. He traveled alone from Guatemala, planning to seek asylum in the US, where his mother became a citizen several years ago. Denis said she applied for him to join her more than two years ago, but he does not know what has been happening with the application and is skeptical her attorney will actually help him. He asked that his name not be used so his chances of getting to the US wouldn’t be jeopardized. “I could be close to getting papers, but if I cross I could be close to ruining it,” Denis said. “There’s a lot uncertainty.” According to Denis, El Barretal is a better place to figure out his next move than the unsanitary conditions at the sports stadium. But in exchange for improved sanitation, space and shelter, migrants were forced to accept being much farther from the border. The location is about 11 miles from the San Ysidro port of entry, where asylum seekers manage an unofficial, handwritten list to determine who is next in the line to apply for asylum in the US. Pat Murphy, a priest at Tijuana’s oldest migrant shelter, la Casa del Migrante, said the newest Central American arrivals did not seem to have realized just how long it could take just to apply for asylum and what would be likely to follow: prolonged detention in US custody. Murphy has for five years welcomed migrants from Central America, Africa and the Middle East to the hillside shelter. It’s a hopeful, bustling place, where residents and staff rotate cleaning duties and follow a strict schedule for family meals and activity time. Once migrants learn that the waiting time can be months, and that the threshold for being granted asylum is high and will probably include a period in detention, many soon decide to stay in Mexico or return home. “Maybe your American dream has to become your Mexican dream – and that’s not so bad,” Murphy said. Government and trade groups have said at least 7,000 jobs are available for this batch of migrants, though wages are typically low and the migrant workforce is vulnerable to exploitation. There is also a cautious optimism about what that life could look like for migrants following the inauguration of Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as Amlo. Amlo has yet to unveil his government’s policy on migration, but activists in Tijuana were encouraged when, on the day he took office, members of his transition team visited the city. Murphy said Amlo’s representatives told him they were there to listen because the president wanted facts about the crisis. Murphy said the government of Enrique Peña Nieto, Amlo’s predecessor, had never sent a representative to the shelter. “That’s a hopeful sign, we’ll see what comes out of it,” Murphy said. Meanwhile, migrants still flee towards the US, which has responded by deploying more than 5,000 troops to the border and employing a controversial tactic that limits how many people can seek asylum each day called metering. With metering in place at San Ysidro, observers say less than 100 people are permitted to seek asylum on an average day – often it’s about 40 to 60. Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said it was “absurd” how few people the US is allowing in. “People are going to start dying because we are creating this backlog,” she said. “The US government is making no effort, and this they have acknowledged. There is no plan in place to increase capacity for processing people. They are not even trying to do that.”"
2018-12-22T09:00:24Z,'In jail you're a ball of emotion': Syrian swimmer on her refugee rescue,"Sara Mardini is in a chipper mood. Freedom, the Syrian readily acknowledges, is a precious thing. For each of the 107 days she spent behind bars in Athens’ high-security Korydallos jail, she clung on to the hope that a trial would prove her innocence. “There were times when I’d say, ‘I can’t do this any more’,” the refugee-turned rescue worker said shortly after her release this month. “My heart was very heavy.” Mardini, a former competitive swimmer, made international headlines along with her sister Yusra after the pair jumped into the sea and towed a sinking dinghy for three hours through the turbulent waters of the Aegean, saving the lives of 18 fellow passengers onboard. She was arrested in August along with three other charity workers on charges of people-smuggling, spying, violation of state secrecy laws and money laundering. By the time a guard broke the news that she was to be freed, Mardini was so mentally and physically exhausted she was unable to leave her bed. “In jail you are a ball of emotion,” she says. “A phone call from someone outside could blow my brain. And then suddenly on a day when I am feeling really bad, when my body seems to have stopped responding and I can’t even lift my little finger, I am told, ‘You will be freed [on bail].’ And all I feel is shock. Shock at everything really.” At 23, Mardini is now the face of humanitarianism under fire. Coming three years after her own dramatic landing on the island of Lesbos, her arrest, the charges against her and her long incarceration pending trial caused international outrage. She is the most high-profile victim of what humanitarian operations have said is the criminalisation of volunteers for charities and aid groups detained across Europe. On 5 December she was finally freed after her lawyers posted a €5,000 (£4,450) bail. While she was locked up, Mardini says she meditated, exercised, attended art classes and spent a lot of time sleeping, in the hope of blocking out what she remains acutely aware of: under Greek law the crimes she was charged with carry penalties of up to 25 years in prison. “I want this to go to trial, I want my freedom back,” she says. Mardini, who has settled in Germany, returned to Lesbos to work as a search and rescue volunteer with the Emergency Response Centre International, a Greek NGO. “I think we will know all the truth when it gets to trial and I won’t feel free until I am over with it, until I hear I am innocent.” The Mardini sisters were among a group of 20 Syrians making the treacherous sea crossing in a small dinghy from Turkey to Greece in August 2015, when their dinghy began taking in water, and the siblings, both competitive swimmers, jumped overboard to haul and push the boat, reaching Lesbos more than three hours later. Yusra, who has since become a UNHCR goodwill ambassador, went on to participate as a refugee team member in the 2016 Rio Olympic games and the sisters are the subject of an upcoming film. Yet the drama swirling around Sara has dominated headlines. To her friends, Mardini is selflessly dedicated to doing good. “I am a card with two faces,” she says, rolling a cigarette between painted fingernails. “I have experienced being inside and outside the boat, I am a rescuer and a refugee. Every single boat I have ever helped, I have felt in my bones.” But for others, Lesbos is at the centre of a murky underworld of people-smuggling. Local officials and police claim that, of all the philanthropic organisations working on the island, the Greek ERCI has aroused most suspicion in tracking migrant arrivals and – according to one police report – bringing people illegally ashore. The group, which has been credited with rescuing hundreds of people at sea, has now ceased operations. Organisations that rescue migrants have come under fire with some claiming they are a “pull factor” for migrants in regions at the frontline of the migration crisis. Sara Mardini shows little anger over what has happened to her. Her months behind bars have made her want to help improve conditions in Greece’s toughest prison. “I will keep in touch with people there – the guards, the prison manager. They were all very lovely. You could see they could feel our pain,” she says. “I am not usually an emotional person. I have learned how to deal with hard emotions … the only thing I do know, however, is that none of us [in ERCI] has done anything illegal. We have very strict rules that we have always followed.” She will spend the next few months doing what she had intended to do before her arrest at Lesbos airport in August: studying at the liberal arts school in Berlin where she has been accepted on scholarship. But the fresh-faced student also has a message. “People should never be afraid of what they don’t know,” she says. “I worry about conflicts not only in Syria, in Africa, Afghanistan, in so many places. Refugees will keep on coming and yet they are not only refugees, they are doctors, engineers, teachers, they can help in Europe too.” Is she upset her that, in the wake of her own ordeal, volunteers reportedly started leaving Lesbos? “Volunteers won’t have it easy,” she says. “They will feel discouraged, but they should know that when they make someone happy, when they make someone smile, it really does mean the world to a person who has lost everything.”"
2018-12-07T12:01:27Z,Guardian and Observer appeal 2018: our chosen charities,"The 2018 Guardian and Observer appeal is supporting five charities which were instrumental in securing justice for the Windrush generation. Their work defends the rights of all whose lives are unfairly disrupted by the UK’s hostile immigration system. Here’s a brief guide to what they do: Praxis Community Projects From its base in east London, Praxis provides specialist legal advice, housing, advocacy and welfare support to achieve justice for thousands of migrants unfairly facing homelessness, destitution and deportation. These included one of the most prominent victims of the Windrush scandal, Sylvester Marshall (who at the time used the pseudonym Albert Thompson). He was made homeless and denied cancer treatment after officials refused to accept he had lived and worked in the UK for 44 years. With Praxis’s assistance, Sylvester received NHS care and his life is transformed for the better. Praxis will use its share of appeal donations to support its frontline work, helping clients get the documentation they need to access basic services and ensuring their rights are recognised. It will invest in advocacy, fundraising, and emergency welfare support such as the provision of emergency housing and food. “The Guardian and Observer charity appeal will help us build support for all migrants in precarious circumstances, and challenge unjust policies,” said the Praxis chief executive, Sally Daghlian. Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) has provided legal assistance to thousands of vulnerable individuals for over 50 years in fulfilment of its mission to promote justice, fairness and equality in immigration law and policy. It was at the forefront of the Windrush scandal, highlighting the impact of the hostile environment, and providing practical help to those facing loss of status and rights. The need for urgent, reliable advice is set to grow and the number of families at risk of destitution or the arbitrary denial of their rights will increase, it says. JCWI plans to respond to this crisis by doubling the amount of free legal advice it is able to offer vulnerable individuals and families across England and Wales, reaching out into communities to provide vital support and build the kind of early warning systems that could prevent another Windrush from happening. “It’s never been more important for us to fight for the rights of those who migrate, and for a better conversation about migration. And we’ve never faced greater odds,” said Satbir Singh, JCWI’s chief executive. Refugee and Migrant Centre The Refugee and Migrant Centre (RMC) is based in Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham. Its mission is to assist refugees and migrants through crisis and disadvantage, by removing barriers to their integration and enabling them to become equal citizens. One of the many cases it has handled in recent years sparked the Windrush scandal after RMC contacted the Guardian. It involved Paulette Wilson, a 61-year-old woman who was detained and threatened with deportation, despite having lived in the UK for 49 years, worked, paid taxes, and had children and grandchildren. RMC achieved justice for Paulette. RMC will use its share of donations to fund casework, support destitute people, pay volunteers’ travel expenses, pay for accredited training for staff and in general sustain the casework team, most of whom are themselves from the communities it serves. “Since 2012 RMC has helped dozens of people from the Windrush generation here legally, struggling to prove their rights and being treated dreadfully. Their entitlement and legality should not have been questioned in the first place,” said Arten Llazari, the charity’s chief executive. “The Windrush cases are just the tip of the iceberg of the problems within the UK’s immigration system.” The Runnymede Trust The Runnymede Trust is the UK’s leading race equality thinktank, founded 50 years ago to provide research and evidence to inform policy and public discussion about race and racism in Britain. The trust acts as a bridge between policymakers and black and minority ethnic communities. During the Windrush campaign it worked closely with frontline charities, journalists, high commissioners, and parliamentarians to bring the hostile immigration injustices to light. Its share of the appeal donations will support a Windrush internship open to black and minority ethnic people with the aim of giving them valuable experience of how to influence policy and public opinion on racial equality. “We will use the funds raised to ensure the evidence on race equality is better understood, and to hold those in power to account on responding to racism in Britain,” said Omar Khan, the trust’s director. Law Centres Network Law centres are community–based, not-for-profit organisations that defend the legal rights of people who cannot afford a lawyer. They provide legal advice, casework and representation on issues such as immigration, housing, benefits and debt, helping people save their homes and jobs and protect their families. A number of law centres across the UK worked to achieve justice for Windrush clients, preventing detention and deportation and ensuring they retained rights and access to public services. They anticipate increased demand for legal help from other communities unfairly caught up in hostile environment policies, including EU citizens. The Law Centres Network will use its share of donations to create a fund to which its 43 members can apply to fund extra capacity to work locally with clients unfairly affected by the hostile environment. This could include provision of extra case worker time, or funding liaison work with community groups to ensure people get the help they need. “As we saw in the cases we took up for the Windrush generation, law centres are a service that people need when they are at their most vulnerable and scared. At that point, we are there to help them,” said Julie Bishop, director of the Law Centres Network. Please donate to our appeal here."
2018-12-31T17:53:10Z,'We are all migrants': Dover divided by boat arrivals,"On Marine Parade in Dover, an empty boat with its windows smashed lies docked on concrete, a blue police banner still stuck to it. The catamaran is the lasting remnant of a voyage taken by a group of 12 migrants who crashed on to the shore in recent weeks. A growing number of people are crossing the Channel from France to the UK, and arriving in Kent, according to reports. An estimated 220 people are thought to have attempted the journey in the past six weeks, including 40, in five boats, on Christmas Day, and a further 40 since. Most recently, a 10-year-old child was one of 12 people who came ashore near Lydd-on-Sea, Kent. On Monday, the impact of what has been happening could be felt on Marine Parade. Locals described a town divided by what a number believe is a crisis “getting out of hand”. Dover, England’s major Channel port, has long been home to immigrants, but the recent publicity and reports about people arriving are creating a sense of frustration. Steven Gash, 59, said: “We are fed up with the situation, it’s a constant influx of illegal immigrations, and if we cannot protect our own coastline … how closely are these people vetted when they come in?” He said some groups in the area are more welcoming, but he believes they do not understand “what [people arriving] could lead to”. “When it comes to the fact these people want a better life, I want a better life,” he said. “The government are not going to give that to me … I have worked all my life and if I wanted to claim anything, I won’t get a thing.” Gash said many in Dover feel people are coming over to seek benefits without being genuinely in need. “When the news says these people pay £20,000 to a trafficker to get them across the channel – if you have £20,000 then [that’s] probably more than the poverty-ridden people in this country,” he said. “So why do you then want to come over and use our health service and our education and benefits?” Meanwhile, Stephen and Jayne Easton described the abandoned catamaran as an eyesore. “It’s falling to pieces and it was carrying 12 people. It hit the harbour wall and capsized,” Stephen Easton said. “It’s just getting out of hand, it’s crazy. Sooner or later, someone will be killed, if they haven’t been already … We need more Border Force cutters here.” Tanya Long, the director of the Dover-based migrant charity Samphire, said recent events had created tension in the area. “Those who claim asylum in France get more benefits, [and for those who think otherwise] it’s a complete lack of understanding about the real reasons people are trying to come here,” she said. “It’s much more complex than that.” Long said there had always been many asylum seekers arriving in Dover. “Lots of what we are hearing is negative. There have been some awful comments like ‘let them drown’ or people saying the area is ‘being invaded’,” she said. However, she added that there is also local support. “My charity is working with local residents in a programme called Dover Welcomes All and bringing together migrant communities through activities to break down any barriers that may exist,” Long said. “There are those in the Dover area who also have compassion and understand the plight of refugees, but perhaps that’s a voice that is not heard … The anti-migrants are more vociferous. Those more supportive and understanding may fear a backlash and don’t want to speak out.” Long said the problem was, to a certain degree, being blown out of proportion: “People are still coming through lorries, etc, but you don’t see that … so people are not as aware of that happening, but when people are arriving on the shore and a local resident comes across them, it’s more visible.” A resident called Irene said it was not a question of being prejudiced, given that there are so many of “Dover’s own who have been neglected and left”. “Young kids on streets, the town has gone to wrack and ruin,” she said. “The homeless are all youngsters – you do what you can, but you can tell they are just going to die in the cold. Then there are people who fought in our forces neglected.” Her companion, Mick, said: “As soon as people come over here [as migrants], they get looked after. They might be at an immigration centre, but they get looked after, not sent back where they came from.” Razia Shariff, the chief executive of Kran, a charity that supports unaccompanied minors seeking refuge in Kent, said negative reactions to news of the “crisis” are disheartening but not surprising. “There has always been a narrative around any sort of migration, even around refugees and asylum seekers who have the right to seek safety,” she said. “But this position of ‘send them back’ is a kneejerk reaction, instead of being considered and taking into account the different factors that make people make these very difficult decisions.” While the charity has worked with a “consistent” number of people, the fact that the latest arrivals are coming by boat is new, she said. “We think it is because of the tightening of the borders in France, which happened after the closing of the camps,” Shariff said. “Now people are much more reliant on agents who have taken other pathways through places like Plymouth, and now risking their lives in boats.” Before 2016, responsibility for accommodating and caring for an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child in England fell to the local authority where the child first presented, putting pressure on entry points such as Kent and Hillingdon. In July that year, the government launched the National Transfer Scheme to try to help distribute the responsibility for caring for unaccompanied asylum seekers more evenly among local authorities – the idea being that no local authority’s number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children should constitute more than 0.07% of its total care population. As a result, the numbers of unaccompanied minors Kent dealt with fell, but they started rising again in March this year, because many in the original 2015 cohort started to leave care, taking Kent below the 0.07% figure, so it began to accept more unaccompanied minors instead of transferring them to other local authorities. One couple who pass by are more understanding. “If we were in a similar situation, from a war-torn country and trying to make a better life for ourselves, we would do the same thing,” said Fred, who does not want to give his surname. “But people don’t think about that. In a way, we are all migrants … and people forget that.” His partner, Katya, said: “People often think of their own lives and think most people are just trying to trick the systems that are present, but actually if we were in that situation then anyone would try to go somewhere they wanted to feel safe and get some help. Sometimes people think of what is going on around them and not others.”"
2018-12-24T20:00:04Z,"Global migration figures higher than previously thought, study finds","Over a five-year period, about one in 80 people around the world migrate to another country, researchers have revealed, in a study that shows more than a quarter of that movement is down to people returning to their country of birth. Global migration is difficult to measure, with data often lacking for developing countries and inaccurate for others. But a pair of researchers in the US say they have come up with a model that provides the most reliable “big picture” view of human migration yet. Crucially, they say, it takes into account the “churn” of people moving into and out of countries, something previous global estimates had not included. “Policies that are set based on a quota of a number of people who enter the country miss out on the fact that you should also be expecting a lot of the existing migrant population to be leaving the country,” said Dr Jonathan Azose, a co-author of the study from the University of Washington. The study, published in the journal PNAS, reveals a model for estimating migration around the world between 1990 and 2015, broken down into five-year chunks. The team say they were able to show the model worked by comparing its results with high-quality migration data from Europe. A key problem with the previous leading global migration estimates, says Azose, is that the approach looked at overall changes in the net number of immigrants in a country over time, without taking into account that many individuals left and others arrived, resulting in underestimates of movement, something the new model tackles. It suggests that between 67 million and 87 million people, including refugees, migrated for each five-year chunk – far higher than previous global estimates of 34m-46 m migrations – and corresponding to 1.13%-1.29% of the global population. The team note that while absolute numbers of people migrating appear to have risen, there has been little change in the proportion of the world’s population who are on the move. That said, key origins and destinations change over time: for example,movement of Syrians in Saudi Arabia to Turkey between 2010 and 2015 were a leading contributor to “transit” migrations, while migration of Syrians from Syria to Turkey and Lebanon were among the largest emigration movements in that period. The new study suggests that while migration to a new country makes up the biggest proportion of human movement, return migration – in which individuals return to their country of birth – accounted for between 26% and 31% of migration in each five-year period. However, the team admit the new model has limitations, including the fact that different countries require individuals to stay there for different lengths of time to be registered as a migrant, and figures for the total number of migrants in each country might not be accurate to start with, meaning possible errors in the data used. But the team say their work could help researchers delve deeper into what causes people to migrate and help them build predictive models for this. Dr Nando Sigona, an expert in international migration and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “Estimating migration flows is extremely difficult. Data are limited and incomplete, especially in less economically developed countries. This contributes to a perception in the west that all migration flows are directed towards the global north,” he said. While the new model had limitations, he added, it offered a more rounded view of global migration, including showing movements between countries in the south and highlighting the large proportion of return journeys. “Finally,” he said, “it shows a world which is more dynamic and on the move than previously thought.”"
2018-12-28T17:22:50Z,Sajid Javid: Channel migrant crossings 'a major incident',"The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has declared the rising number of migrants attempting to cross the English Channel a “major incident”, as campaigners and charities warned of increasing desperation among those attempting to make the journey. Javid also appointed a gold commander to deal with the growing crisis and asked for an urgent call with his French counterpart to discuss the issue. MPs called for more patrols along the coast. Two more inflatable boats carrying 12 men from Syria and Iran were intercepted on Friday, adding to the 82 migrants detained trying to cross the Channel since Christmas Day. At least 250 migrants were intercepted in the Channel between January and November 2018, including 65 people, mainly Iranians, in the last three weeks of November, the Guardian understands. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said: “For families and children to end up in small boats in the Channel in the middle of winter is incredibly dangerous. There is a real risk of tragedy if urgent action isn’t taken. People smuggling gangs offering these precarious journeys for profit are putting lives at risk. “The British and French authorities have known for some time about the risks posed by criminal gangs of people smugglers along the coast. They have been active in encampments over many years but much more coordinated French and British action is needed to tackle them.” Diane Abbott MP, the shadow home secretary, said: “These are extremely dangerous circumstances in which people are choosing to cross borders. We have a duty to those at risk in British waters, but we also have a duty to refugees, many of whom are fleeing war, poverty and persecution. “Our focus needs to be on much better cooperation with the French authorities, and European nations as a whole to create safe and legal routes for those seeking asylum. No one should feel they have no option but to risk their lives in this way.” The Home Office said Javid had commissioned detailed options from the Border Force about the provision of additional vessels in the Channel, including another cutter, and asked whether it was likely to encourage more people to try to make the crossing rather than act as a deterrent. The immigration minister Caroline Nokes will visit Border Force officers in Dover on Saturday to discuss the situation on the ground. Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal who has been vocal in his calls for more Border Force vessels, said: “We are seeing a big increase in numbers as Iranian migrants are paying huge sums to people traffickers to get them across the Channel. The criminal gangs need to be caught and brought to justice before these craft leave the French coast. “It’s time the Home Office took this problem seriously and stepped up resources along the Kent coast – with more cutters and more patrol vessels. It’s time we invested in stronger borders, all the way along our coast.” Charities and international humanitarian groups have witnessed an increased number of Iranians trying to make the crossing in recent months. The groups said it was normal to see sudden increases or decreases of certain nationalities. Caroline Gregory, who works with Calais Action, which has been supporting migrants in northern France for the last three years, said: “This is a fairly new phenomenon because it’s so, so dangerous. I think it’s a sign of increasing desperation … that people are resorting to this.” Financial circumstances help to determine how individuals travel from France to the UK, she said. Those able to afford to pay smugglers now travel on small boats, but there are still many who attempt to get on to a lorry. Bridget Chapman, a spokeswoman for the Kent Refugee Action Network (KRAN), which mainly works with unaccompanied minors, said there had been a dramatic rise in need for its services. “Last year we worked with around 300 people and this year it looks like we would have worked with 600,” she said. “We’re forcing people, who have a right to claim asylum, into the most dangerous journey. It’s a miracle no one has died yet making that crossing and I really hope no one does.” Josh Hallam, a field manager for Help Refugees, who works in northern France, said the conditions in the migrant camps are the worst he has seen. “You’re fluctuating between 1,000 to 2,000 people across [the camps in] Calais and Grande-Synthe,” he said. Migrants in northern France were living in disused industrial estates and the woods since the Calais refugee camp known as the Jungle was dismantled in 2016, he said. Police have conducted regular raids on the encampments, destroyed tents, disposed of people’s personal belongings, and pepper-sprayed families and unaccompanied minors in a bid to disperse them, he said. Thangam Debbonaire, a Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on refugees, said: “There is currently a global refugee crisis and the UK takes a tiny fraction of the people fleeing war and persecution. In order to share responsibility fairly across the world, we, and other countries, need to take more people by the safe and legal route of resettlement. Unfortunately the US has halved the number of people they will take, and the need is growing. “Some people are also forced to flee due to other dire circumstances, which demand our attention. If we ignore these problems, we will see desperate people exploited … people crossing the Channel in small boats is just one example of the perilous situations people are forced into.”"
2018-12-27T06:00:14Z,'Unprecedented' mass releases of migrants strain churches to limit,"A lone Christmas tree strung with lights stands near a pile of donated toys in the main hall of El Calvario United Methodist church in Las Cruces, southern New Mexico, a touch of festive cheer for the migrants who find sanctuary there after a long trek to the United States. It has brought some comfort to a father from Catacamas in the Olancho department of Honduras, who arrived at the church shortly before Christmas with his 17-year-old daughter, escaping destitution and violence in Central America. “It has been a very difficult journey. What I’ve gone through is something I will never be able to forget,” said the father, who requested anonymity while talking to the Guardian, for his and his daughter’s security. “I’m looking for something better for my children. I’m only asking for an opportunity to survive.” The pair are far from the home where they began their journey and still many miles from their goal – meeting up with family members who live in Tennessee. But the church feels like a brief haven. Surprisingly, perhaps, they were dropped directly at the doorstep by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, in a bus with 25 other migrants, after a week of being held in detention by the US authorities. Sometimes, churches and shelters get word from Ice that they are bringing people released from detention into the care of family or sponsors in the US. But not always. Chaos broke out over Christmas in the nearby border city of El Paso, Texas, after Ice dumped more than 200 people at the Greyhound bus station there, and planned to bring more. They were told to sleep rough, not bother anyone and figure out for themselves, with no warning or provisions, how to reach relatives, according to local reports. Local volunteers hurriedly brought food, water and cellphones to help those stranded and bewildered, while area shelters, full to capacity, tried to find places for them to stay. Ice has been unceremoniously offloading migrants from overstretched detention facilities, in increasing numbers in recent months. Authorities allow them to stay with US relatives or sponsors while their applications to remain in the US crawl through the system. “It’s a challenge,” George Miller, the lead pastor at El Calvario, said. Ice is releasing an average of 2,000 migrants a week just in the area around Las Cruces and the nearby border city of El Paso, Texas. Numbers began increasing sharply in the summer after the Trump administration started detaining more people caught crossing the border unlawfully, Miller said. “We’ve been operating at full capacity ever since,” Miller said. “It looks like this trend will continue for a while.” The church offers cots, a bit of peace and quiet and hot meals, which Miller said those arriving often haven’t had for weeks and sometimes months. Coordination between local shelters, including El Calvario, and Ice is led by Annunciation House in El Paso, the mission for refugees, migrants and the homeless that was thrust into the headlines recently after giving voice to the father of Jakelin Caal Maquin, the seven-year-old girl from Guatemala who died in US custody days before Christmas, prompting outrage from the United Nations. The government hastily announced a new policy of medical checks on every migrant child in its custody after a second death, of a Guatemalan boy, eight, over Christmas. “We run out of space all the time,” said the executive director, Ruben Garcia. “We’re always trying to find more churches … doing all this with the help of volunteers. It’s a lot of work.” They offer beds, food, showers, access to phones – and encouragement amid the chaos. Annunciation House was on the frontline again on Christmas Eve amid the chaos at the Greyhound station. “The only reason Ice releases these migrants is because they don’t have enough detention facilities for all of the families – if not they would be releasing a lot fewer migrants,” he added. The churches and non-profits the Guardian spoke with asserted that they were not paid by the government; they began coordinating with Ice principally to prevent people ending up on the streets after the government began releasing large numbers, citing a lack of capacity and legal limits on detention. “I’ve never seen anything like this … the mass releases are unprecedented,” said Teresa Cavendish, director of operations for Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona, who has been helping asylum seekers in Tucson. A shelter in Tucson called The Inn, run by pastor Dottie Escobedo-Frank, is named for the biblical story of Mary and Joseph resorting to a stable to bring Jesus into the world after there was no room for them at the inn in Bethlehem. She said the local bus station called the shelter recently about a group of 20 people who were dropped off there by an Ice bus. “We are grateful that these folks are getting out and are coming to our place instead of being at the bus depot,” Escobedo-Frank said. While the Trump administration has been focusing on mass migration “caravans” traveling from Central America, with thousands now stuck in limbo in Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, crossings by small groups and individuals have been surging elsewhere, further from the public eye. US officials in the Rio Grande valley in eastern Texas are apprehending about 680 people a day, compared with fewer than 150 in San Diego daily, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said. Raul Ortiz, local CBP acting chief in eastern Texas said few detained there were part of caravans. When the authorities ask La Posada Providencia, a shelter in San Benito, eastern Texas, to take in migrants they are never turned down, Magda Bolland, the executive director said. However, its 29 beds are not enough. “Sometimes I come into work and there’s someone sleeping in my office,” she said. Church leaders in Arizona say Ice has released about 5,000 migrants in the Phoenix area in the last two months and they have had to scramble to find diapers, clothing and food at the last minute. Magdalena Schwartz, a local pastor, coordinates with Ice several times a day. She tells them which of a dozen local churches have space after Ice shares how many asylum seekers will be released. Some local pastors have recently asked to take a break, citing strained resources. “It’s overwhelming. We don’t have enough churches,” she said. Central Christian church in Mesa, Arizona, has recruited local host families to take in migrants. And Israel Camacho, a pastor at Iglesia Nueva Esperanza, in Mesa, sets up air mattresses. “Compared to what the people have been experiencing, to be in a warm place with an air mattress and some hot food is like, ‘wow’,” Camacho said. After a tumultuous year in US immigration policy, many shelters were full over Christmas. In Tucson, Escobedo-Frank at The Inn summed up: “In most of the main faiths, there are stories of us welcoming the stranger. At this time, we’re trying to live out the Christmas story in real time, here in the desert,” she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report"
2018-12-29T20:18:02Z,Why is the Syracuse man who saved thousands of migrants out of a job?,"The history of the migrant crisis in the central Mediterranean, the story of its dead and shipwrecked, is all contained in a messy desk overflowing with files and folders in a tiny room in the prosecutor’s office in Syracuse. Somewhere among the heaps of papers is Commissario Carlo Parini, head of an illegal-immigration taskforce. Parini is pensive. Late last month it was announced that the taskforce’s office in the historic south-eastern Sicilian city was closing, with an abrupt explanation: “Arrivals from Libya in Sicily have decreased by 80%, and this office is no longer needed.” From 2006 until earlier this month, the 56-year-old Parini – who at 6ft 5in towers over most people – headed the Interforce Group on Illegal Immigration in Sicily (Gicic). In that time nearly 200,000 people arrived in the island. Their stories are all catalogued in the dusty folders that cover his office. Over the past few days they have been transferred to cardboard boxes, their final destination the basement. “They say the arrivals are over,” says Parini. “And yet this year we intercepted 12 sailing boats transporting 900 migrants from Turkey. We’ve followed these investigations for many years. We had almost arrived at the heart of the criminal organisation. It’s a shame to stop now.” Looking around the office in search of something he fears has been lost, he suddenly exclaims. “Here it is! Finally! I’d been looking for this for days. Read this: it’s the first migrant case I worked on.” He remembers it as if it were yesterday. Thirty-five shivering Sri Lankans arrived in Italy from Egypt aboard a wooden boat one winter evening in 1999, when Parini was still a junior anti-Mafia police officer. As he waited for their arrival at the port of Riposto, just along the coast from Syracuse, he had no idea that the moment would change his life and set the course for the next 20 years of his career. The following day the newspapers in Italy reported confidently that the arrivals were “an isolated case”. No one – not the police, and certainly not the press – could have predicted then what would happen over the coming years, when Europe would be forced to come to grips with the most intense migrant and refugee crisis since the second world war. That arrival in the port of Riposto was a mere hint of what was to come. In 2000, 2,782 migrants crossed the Mediterranean to reach Sicily; 18,225 came in 2002. In 2011 it was 57,181. Between 2006 and last November, Parini handled 1,084 arrivals, investigated the deaths of more than 2,000 migrants, and arrested 1,081 people accused of human trafficking. This last total earned him the attention of the international press, who lionised him. It even earned him a nickname: “Smuggler Hunter”. “We worked day and night, relentlessly,” Parini says. “We’d spend entire days at the port. One of my colleagues had a heart attack. He had had no sleep for three consecutive days. And then that cursed day came in October 2013 that changed the migrant crisis for ever. That day that changed us all.” The mass drowning off Lampedusa on 3 October 2013 marked a turning point. That night 368 people perished in the sea in an attempt to reach Sicily. Until then European governments had largely watched from their capitals. Now they agreed that it was time to act. On 18 October, Italy launched the Mare Nostrum operation, a military intervention for humanitarian ends intended to prevent such tragedies. Parini became one of the commanders of the mission, and aboard the military ship San Giorgio he began patrolling the waters of the central Mediterranean and rescuing migrant boats in distress. “We saved thousands of lives,” Parini says. “And at the same time we attempted to investigate the people involved in the trafficking business, who were exploiting migrants and getting rich in the process.” Italian prosecutors convinced their EU counterparts to join the crusade on the premise of a somewhat romantic principle: that the same strategy employed to capture mafiosi could be used to combat people-smugglers. Sicilian prosecutors suspected that among smugglers there was a power structure regulated by an honour code similar to the Cosa Nostra’s. Wire taps – such a vital weapon in the fight against the Mafia – also came in handy. Sitting behind their desks, the prosecutors eavesdropped on hundreds of people in Africa. But without credible intelligence the hunt from a distance against human traffickers was deeply frustrating. “We arrested thousands of boat drivers,” says Parini. “That was our duty. But the real smugglers were in Libya. And we didn’t have men in Libya.’’ While the prosecutors continued their hunt, in Europe the presence of migrants and refugees led to protests, a rise in rightwing populism, and authoritarian and repressive policies towards asylum seekers. Mare Nostrum was superseded by Operation Triton, which was intended to patrol the Mediterranean more than save lives. In 2015 non-governmental ships began rescue operations in Libyan waters, saving tens of thousands of lives, while the Italian authorities began attacking aid groups, confiscating vessels without just cause. “Personally, in my work I have never had problems with NGOs,” says Parini. “In fact, some of them were very efficient.” Migrant arrivals started to nosedive in February 2017 when, in an attempt to stem the flow, Marco Minniti, the former interior minister from the centre-left Democratic party, struck a deal with the Libyan coastguard that allowed it to return migrants and refugees to a country where aid agencies say they suffer torture and abuse. “I have no knowledge of what is going on in Libya,” says Parini. “But given what I’ve been told by the thousands of migrants that I’ve questioned, it must be hell. Injuries and signs of torture on their bodies are proof. Many women were raped in Libya, and those who gave birth in Sicily abandoned their children because they were the result of physical violence, a violence that they wanted to forget for ever.” Amnesty International estimates that about 20,000 people were intercepted by the coastguard in 2017 and taken back to Libya. This June a new government took power in Rome in the form of an alliance between the populist Five Star Movement and the rightwing League. The new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, is noted for his anti-immigrant policies and his first move was to close Italy’s ports to the rescue boats. Parini prefers not to comment on Salvini’s tactics, and perhaps his silence speaks louder than words. Today NGO rescue boats have almost disappeared from the central Mediterranean. People seeking asylum are still risking the crossing but, without the rescue boats, shipwrecks are likely to rise dramatically. The death toll has fallen in the past year, but the number of those drowning as a proportion of arrivals has risen sharply in the past few months, with the possibility of dying during the crossing now three times higher. Parini left his office in mid-December. After heading one of the most important taskforces charged with fighting illegal immigration in Italy, he is now working for the customs bureau. The history of the migrant crisis, now stored in a basement in Syracuse, will also be indelibly lodged in the memory of this man: a man who will never forget the 167 bodies he was forced to look in the face. “I will take those faces to my grave, and maybe even beyond,” says Parini."
2018-12-24T19:00:02Z,Dreaming of a hybrid Christmas: Australia's migrants meld traditions,"At the Christmas lunch Jay Kumar enjoys each year, there’s a smorgasbord of Indian and other Asian foods as well as the occasional nod to local surroundings. The big hit is the seafood. “Our friend’s partner is Aussie, his mother is, of course, Aussie, and they like to have a roast and roasted vegetables,” says Kumar, an Indian migrant. “Being Hindu, I don’t eat pork, I don’t eat beef, but I’m a crazy fan of seafood and chicken and all those kinds of things.” Kumar lives in Melbourne’s western suburbs with his Vietnamese partner, Quyen. Last week, he and his friends exchanged presents gathered around the indoor palm that they’ve fashioned into a Christmas tree. Christmas was a fairly foreign concept to Delhi-born Kumar, but he started learning about it on a few overseas work trips, in particular to Scotland. He likens it to Diwali in its “feel and the aura” and, since his second year living in Australia, it has become “a normal, regular celebration for me”. For Kumar, like many in Australia’s migrant community, this new, foreign holiday represents an opportunity to take what you like and lose what you don’t; meld your own culture to the one most might associate with your new home. With families often many time zones away, it is also a time for them to pull together, deprived of the experience of a much-needed catch-up with mothers and fathers, siblings and cousins. Kumar met his group of friends in his first share house when he came to Australia nine years ago. After Kumar’s Kris Kringle party, they’ll also have a Christmas Eve late lunch and pop around to friends’ homes on Christmas Day. The Hindus and the Buddhists outnumber the Christians yet they’ve embraced Christmas with open arms. Perhaps there’s a reason for that. “Only a few of our friends have their parents here. For most, they are in their home countries,” he says. “All of us get together and cook, eat, drink and get ourselves knocked out.” Christmas was not a new concept to Manfred Mletsin. Yet the version of Yuletide festivities the 26-year-old Estonian international student knew and loved was far removed from what he has come to enjoy 12,098km and a few dozen degrees celsius away. In stinking hot Darwin. Mletsin, who moved to Australia four years ago, remembers feeling surprised to see locals eating mandarins all year round. “A lot of Estonian people, if they smell mandarins they just relate it to Christmas straight away,” he says. “I was like, wow. I can say they are actually one of my favourite things. [Now] I can have them all year long.” Mletsin is used to celebrating Christmas on 24 December like many Europeans. The hot weather is a jarring difference, though he has become used to the concept of a Christmas Day barbecue, something he first thought of as “very weird”. “Obviously we still do gifts on that day – it’s something different,” he says. “In Estonia, you sit down with your family [on Christmas Eve], you talk about how grateful you are, kind of like American thanksgiving.” He’s not religious, but in Darwin Mlestin has started attending a Christmas church service to support a friend, who sings carols. If there’s anything he misses about Christmas at home, where his family remains, it’s “the weather and the blood sausages”, which they eat with sour cream, alongside sauerkraut and potatoes. Tereza Audo, 56, says she misses the singing and the dancing. In her native South Sudan, which is predominantly Christian, Christmas is not a lunch on 25 December, it’s a month-long celebration of singing, dancing and praying at church. There are no Christmas trees, stockings or Santa Claus, though they adorn their homes with lights and other decorations. “In our country, we start at the first of December,” she says. “We are celebrating, singing and dancing, until Christmas comes. Here, we just see the lights and decorations in November and there is no celebrating, nothing until the 24th, even some don’t celebrate the 24th.” Audo came to Australia in 2004 after five years in Egypt. She shares her home in Melton with three of her six grandchildren. They don’t get presents from “Santa” – instead Audo takes the kids to the shops and gets them to pick out something they’d like. This year Audo and her family, including her six children and their extended relatives, will eschew a big meal on 25 December for a lunch on 1 January. That’s not to say they won’t mark Christmas. “We are going to celebrate in the 24th and then we come back again for prayer on the 25th,” she says. “But we are not going to make the food on that day, we are going to make the food on New Year’s. On Christmas we are going to have a lot of sweets and cakes.” In her first year in Australia, Audo adopted the Christmas tree. She remembers that December, gathering with other South Sudanese at a church hall in Melbourne’s west. “I put up the decorations. We were at the church celebrating at 24 December until we finished at six in the morning, and then we came back and had prayers on the 25th.” They ate lots of different homemade food, including combo – a spinach and peanut stew that can include dried fish or dried meat. “We combined it with Australian food,” Audo says. “Like KFC.”"
2018-12-25T17:03:43Z,Children among dozens of migrants rescued crossing Channel,"Two children were among dozens of people rescued trying to cross the Channel in the early hours of Christmas Day. A group of 40 migrants, some of whom said they were from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, were picked up by authorities in five separate incidents over a period of around only seven hours. A child was one of the 13 – 11 of whom are understood to be Iraqis and two Iranian – on board a dinghy off the coast of Deal which was spotted just before 7am. A Border Force cutter and lifeboat were dispatched from the Kent coast to rescue the group. An Afghan girl was among eight people, including seven Iranian men, who arrived in Folkestone, Kent, at about 2.40am. Border Force said it was alerted to the group by Kent police ports unit after two of the migrants had arrived at a hotel asking for help explaining their boat was in the harbour. The children will be looked after by social services while the adults have been sent to immigration officials for interview after being checked over by medical staff, the Home Office said. Border Force assisted a French maritime vessel between 5am and 6am rescuing nine migrants, who have been transferred to a coastguard tent in the UK for assessment. A Border Force vessel was also dispatched at 5.50am to help a dinghy travelling towards the UK with eight migrants, including one woman, on board. They have been medically assessed and transferred to immigration officials for interview, the Home Office said. Border Force was alerted at 9.20am to a further two people on board a small boat bound for the UK and said it was being assisted with the help of the Maritime &amp; Coastguard agency. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Border Force has intercepted a number of boats containing migrants attempting to cross the Channel overnight and this morning (Tuesday 25 December), and has deployed resources to deal with these incidents. “The evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. “We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk.”"
2018-12-22T06:00:21Z,How many migrant children are detained in US custody?,"On 8 December, after less than two days in the United States, Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin died in the custody of US border patrol. The seven-year-old girl from Guatemala had crossed the US-Mexico border with her father. They left behind a life in which their family of seven lived on just $5 a day and where she’d never owned a toy or a pair of shoes. Initial reports from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) say that Jakelin died of dehydration and shock but the family have asked for the media to not speculate about the cause of death until a formal autopsy is done. There are many other vulnerable children currently in the custody of US immigration authorities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has nine facilities available to detain children who they have been separated from adults, including family members, or who were unaccompanied when they crossed the border. The average length of stay for a child detained ranges from 100 to 240 days, and these children are often held far from family members and without legal representation. Up-to-date numbers showing how many children are currently being held by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aren’t readily available. Even more shockingly, the DHS itself doesn’t have an accurate database for tracking children whom officials have separated from their parents. In April, they lost track of the whereabouts of 1,475 migrant children and a similar incident happened this September when they weren’t able to account for 1,500 migrant children. Despite all this, estimates have been obtained by journalists. The New York Times reported in September that 12,800 children were in federally contracted shelters based on information that had been reported to members of Congress. Updated estimates published earlier this week now put that number at 15,000. Contractors who were asked to inspect these detention facilities had been warning the DHS for years about the harm they cause to children. Immigration officials have also been arrested for the sexual abuse of children in their care. But the Ice detention center that employs them claims it is not responsible for these abuses. Many businesses involved in the detention of migrants at the southern border have political connections, and have been donors to both the Republicans and the Democrats. In January 2017, the private corrections firm Geo group gave Trump a quarter-million-dollar donation. It also spent $1.7m on lobbying government in 2017 (more than any other private prison contractor) and gave $225,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac during the election. The Trump administration subsequently gave Geo group over $1.3bn in Ice contracts. In a statement to the New York Times, Geo Group said that its family center “cared exclusively for mothers together with their children since 2014 when it was established by the Obama administration”.

2018-06-29T05:27:30Z,EU leaders hail summit victory on migration but details scant,"European leaders have papered over the divisions on migration with a promise that some EU countries would take in migrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea, after marathon talks at an EU summit lasting nearly 10 hours. Announcing the end of tense summit talks shortly before dawn, the head of the European council, Donald Tusk, tweeted that EU leaders had reached an agreement, including on migration. Hours earlier that outcome had been in doubt, when Italy threatened to veto the entire text unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Opposition from Poland, Hungary and other central European states to any hint of mandatory action meant talks dragged through the night. The euro jumped 0.6% on news of the deal, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, declared that European cooperation “has won the day”. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “We are satisfied. It was a long negotiation but from today Italy is no longer alone.” But the bloc dodged an agreement on controversial refugee quotas, as a quartet of central European countries resisted language on EU-wide responsibility. The outcome is already being seen as a thin deal. It is also unclear whether Angela Merkel has a deal that will secure the future of her coalition government, which has been rocked by disputes over handling refugees. Allies of the German chancellor on Friday morning praised the outcome of the meeting in the highest notes. Günther Oettinger, the European commissioner for budget and human resources, hailed the outcome of the summit as a “genuine breakthrough”. “I believe there are good reasons why the CSU will recognise this as big step in the right direction”, Oettinger told German radio. “We in the CDU will recognise it as a big step in the right direction”. On leaving the summit, the German chancellor conceded that “we still have a lot of work to do to bridge the different views”, but said it was “a good signal” that the EU had agreed a common text. Merkel had warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration. Leaders agreed EU countries should help migrants rescued in the Mediterranean to alleviate the burden on Italy and Greece, but the details remained unclear. The issue has risen to the fore, since Italy closed its ports to migrant rescue ships, leaving several boats adrift at sea, until other countries stepped in to help. In an effort to avoid a chaotic situation, leaders agreed there should be “a shared effort”, but “only on a voluntary basis”. Countries will take in rescued migrants and establish processing centres to assess asylum claims on their soil. In an attempt to force the issue, Italy’s Conte was accused of hijacking the summit when he threatened to block the entire summit conclusions unless he received more help. “I am a law professor,” Conte told his fellow leaders, protesting about the EU’s working methods, promoting an unusual exchange, according to a source. The Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, replied: “Well, I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, added that he used to be a welder and he did not agree with the Italian’s way of making his point either. The summit exposed Europe’s longstanding divisions on migration between central Europe, which refuses to take any refugees, versus western countries, which are seeking “solidarity” even in a token way. Finding a more consensual note, EU leaders called for migrant processing centres in north African countries. They agreed to “swiftly explore the concept of regional platforms in close cooperation” with non-EU countries and the UN refugee agency and the International Organisation for Migration, also a UN-backed agency. In essence, this means migrant processing centres in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. EU funds would be available to persuade countries to sign on, but so far no countries have agreed, while a couple have ruled themselves out. In a sign of the political complexities involved, the UN agency vision for the scheme clashes with those of some EU leaders, who put the accent on closing borders and stopping arrivals. Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, called for a “strong border” to stop what he called an “invasion” of migrants. In contrast, the UNHCR/IOM paper seen by the Guardian calls for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU could not outsource the problem. “The idea is really not us and them, either Europe or North Africa,” Eugenio Ambrosi, Europe director for the International Organization for Migration, told the Guardian. “It is a Mediterranean approach that is shared by those countries that are willing.” “What we do not want is external processing centres and we definitely do not want an Australian model,” he said, referring to controversial detention centres on Pacific islands. Conte said his government had not decided whether to set up a migrant processing centre and had not been urged to do so. But the first test from the summit may be for Merkel, who needs to convince her conservative coalition partners that she has a way to control migrants travelling to Germany from southern countries. Germany’s hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer, who is also the leader of the CSU, has threatened to close Germany’s borders to refugees unless Merkel comes up with a plan by 1 July. This has prompted fears that closing Germany’s frontier would lead to a domino effect of closures, destroying the border-free travel area that underpins jobs and trade. At the summit, EU leaders also agreed to roll over wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russia, an outcome that had been in doubt following the recent election of Italy’s populist government that is more sympathetic to Vladimir Putin of Russia."
2018-11-29T13:27:20Z,The Huddersfield video outrages us. But refugees need more than that | Michael Segalov,"By Wednesday morning, many millions of people had watched a video of a 15-year-old Syrian refugee seemingly being thrown to the ground and water being poured on his face in a Huddersfield school playground. The incident had apparently taken place some weeks before, but it was shared overnight on Tuesday and quickly went viral. It’s impossible for any compassionate person to watch the short clip and not feel distressed by it. This is why politicians and public figures posted about their outrage, and why over £125,000 has already been raised online, to support the victim and his family. West Yorkshire police confirmed on Wednesday morning that it was investigating an allegation of a racially aggravated assault, and a 16-year-old is to be charged with assault. We don’t know whether the suspect will be found guilty or whether a court will find the attack was racially motivated. However, this incident and the way it has played out throw up some difficult issues. Let’s look to the reaction – the outpouring of anger from many online. There are those already expressing faux-outrage, intent on absolving themselves of some portion of blame. The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries demanded we show refugees “love and acceptance”; her colleague Zac Goldsmith retweeted the video on Twitter, including a caption describing it as “heartbreaking”. The government minister Tobias Ellwood, in a tweet subsequently deleted, labelled the attack an “absolute disgrace”. This is the very same Nadine Dorries who demanded that a woman of colour “appreciate the country you benefit from”, and linked London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to Muslim sexual abusers. In his failed bid to be elected mayor of London, Goldsmith ran a racist campaign. Ellwood voted in parliament to shut down a scheme designed to give sanctuary in the United Kingdom to young Syrian refugees. Theirs is the party of the hostile environment policy, of Prevent, and of Windrush too. Ignoring how they themselves contributed towards an environment where children apparently attack other children for being refugees is the easy way out. Children are a product of the society that creates them. Our values and ideas are influenced by those who raise us and those in power, through education and through our peers. It is hardly surprising that Britain’s hostility to migrants, to refugees and to anyone “other” will affect not just those who become the victims of prejudice, but will also poison the minds of the next generation. During an erratic Newsnight appearance on Wednesday night, Ellwood asked the nation: where does this individual bully get these ideas from? He could do worse than try a little introspection. And if he truly believes that racist playground bullying is so awful, one can only wonder what he makes of his government’s approach to refugees and migration, which continues to see innocent people locked up in detention centres, trapped in camps, or simply left to die. Meanwhile it feels like part of the left, at times, has come to rely on specific incidents and the injustice of our immigration system to make our case. Articulating what a “progressive immigration system” or “anti-racist political education” looks like isn’t easy, so pointing at stories on social media that pull on all of our heartstrings does – of course – make sense. But how much can highlighting individual stories achieve? The shocking picture of the toddler Alan Kurdi drowned on a beach hasn’t really changed government policy or public opinion, or saved lives. The family of the boy in this video are considering leaving Huddersfield because of the sustained racial and physical abuse they say their children have faced. I don’t hold out much hope that the donations and outpouring of goodwill they are now receiving will make life better for all refugees in Britain. It’s right to call out injustice and hypocrisy – but surely that’s not enough. Today I’m asking myself: how could a Labour government ensure no refugee families are abused? Years of hostility to migrants won’t be easily undone. Sympathy with individual victims can’t come at the expense of concrete policy ideas. A couple of years ago, I spent time covering far-right demonstrations as a reporter, but once each one was over I’d try to start conversations with local young people hanging about afterwards. I’d try to understand how they’d found themselves on the march, and to challenge their views. Yes, children should be held accountable for their actions. Violence or racism is never excusable, but children can and do change their ways. Meanwhile, rather than simply posting messages on social media, the rest of us have a far greater task. While we may hear less of the “refugee crisis”, that does not mean the problem has gone away. The UN migration agency reports that more than 100,000 people had already entered Europe by sea in 2018 by early November. Nearly 2,000 are known to have died. It’s all of our responsibility to force this life-and-death issue permanently back on to the agenda, and to reverse years of xenophobia from the top. • Michael Segalov is a journalist and author"
2018-12-10T15:58:07Z,UN states agree historic global deal to manage migration crisis,"The first ever international deal on the migration crisis was signed on Monday by a majority of UN states, despite vociferous objections led by the United States. The historic, non-binding global pact seeking to better manage migration was approved by delegates from 164 nations following 18 months of debate and negotiation. German chancellor Angela Merkel hailed it as an “important day”. The UN’s global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration, signed in Marrakech, is aimed at coordinating action on migration around the world. It was rejected by President Donald Trump a year ago. Since then Austria, which holds the EU presidency, has pulled out of the process, along with Australia, Chile, the Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Slovakia and the Dominican Republic. Merkel, who welcomed hundreds of thousand of refugees from Syria and Afghanistan into her country, received a standing ovation on Monday after an impassioned speech in which she said the UN was founded after the second world war and spoke of the “incredible suffering on humankind” wrought by the Nazi regime. The compact, she said, is about “nothing less than the foundation of our international cooperation”. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, said the pact was being misused by some political parties to spread disinformation. Michel, whose coalition government split over his support for the pact, said in Marrakech that the text had sparked “lively debate” in Europe but was being exploited by political parties “to spread lies and mistruth”. He insisted that signing the compact would place “my country … on the right side of history”. Critics argue the accord could challenge national sovereignty and say they fear an influx of migrants. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday it was a myth that the agreement infringed on the sovereignty of member states. Six countries, among them Israel and Bulgaria, are debating whether to quit the deal, a UN spokesman said after the pact was adopted. Thirty out of the 193 UN countries that agreed on the pact did not attend the conference. Marta Foresti, director of the human mobility initiative at the Overseas Development Institute, described the accord as “very significant” and “remarkable”, given the current political landscape. In Europe, legitimate fears of migrants coming into countries have been hijacked by far right groups and in the US, Trump has not only pulled out of the compact, but made strong efforts to convince others to do so. On Friday, the US described the pact as “an effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states”. Foresti said the accord’s status as not legally binding did not mean it would not work. The Paris climate change agreement, she said, was a hybrid of legally and non-legally binding. She said: “Over the last few years we have seen just how badly governments all over the world have failed to put in place policies that protect the lives of migrants and allay public concerns over messy and incoherent approaches to border management. “The global compact for migration will help governments work together to better manage migration and ensure that people making cross-border journeys can do so in a legal, orderly and safe way.” The idea of the agreement was to create a political platform for states to cooperate, she said. The global pact lays out 23 objectives to open up legal migration and discourage illegal border crossings, as the number of people living outside their country of birth globally has surged to more than 250 million. Unicef described the pact as a “historic achievement” for children and states alike. Laurence Chandy, of Unicef, said: “Today, more than 100 countries still have policies of migration detention for children. Imagine if alternatives to migration detention for children were adopted globally, and the number of detained children fell from a million today to zero. Imagine if we could close the gap in access to education and health for migrant children so that such inequities did not exist.”"
2018-12-11T05:00:03Z,'Cyprus is saturated' - burgeoning migrant crisis grips island,"When Rubar and Bestoon Abass embarked on their journey to Europe they had no idea that Cyprus was the continent’s easternmost state. Like most Iraqi Kurds heading west, their destination was Germany, not an EU nation barely 100 miles from war-torn Syria. “I had never heard of Cyprus,” said Rubar, reaching for his pregnant wife’s hand as they sat gloomily in a migrant centre run by the Catholic charity Caritas in the heart of Nicosia. “The smugglers told us it was much cheaper to get to and was still in Europe. We paid $2,000 [£1,590] for the four of us to come.” Cyprus is in the midst of a burgeoning migrant crisis as smuggler networks take advantage of the Mediterranean island’s partition and proximity to the Middle East. As in Greece, when Europe’s refugee crisis erupted with Syria’s descent into civil war, support groups have rushed to deal with the social ailments that have arisen with the influx. “Cyprus is saturated,” its interior minister, Constantinos Petrides, said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s no longer easy to absorb such flows, or handle the situation, no matter how much money we get.” The island has exceeded every other EU member state in asylum claims in 2018, recording the highest number per capita with almost 6,000 applications for a population of about 1 million. By August requests were 55% higher than for the same eight-month period in 2017, a figure itself 56% higher than that for 2016, according to the interior ministry. With the country’s asylum and reception systems vastly overstretched, alarmed officials have appealed to Brussels for help. “This is a European problem,” said Petrides, adding that closed borders elsewhere in the bloc were placing a disproportionate burden on small frontline states such as Cyprus. “It’s absolutely necessary to find a holistic solution … which means distributing asylum seekers through an automatic relocation mechanism to countries throughout the EU.” Rubar and Bestoon arrived with their two children in August. Like the ever-growing number of Syrians also heading here from overcrowded camps in Turkey and Lebanon, the couple landed in Northern Cyprus, the self-styled state acknowledged only by Ankara in the 44 years since Turkish troops invaded and seized over a third of the island’s territory. They then took the increasingly well-trodden route of sneaking across the dividing buffer zone into the internationally recognised Greek-controlled south. Stretching 112 miles across Cyprus, the UN-patrolled ceasefire line offers innumerable blind spots for those determined to evade detection. Geography’s stark reality hit, Rubar admits, when he was shown Cyprus on the world map adorning the migrant centre’s airy reception room. “If I had known I’d never have come,” said the farmer. “After all, being here we’re much nearer Baghdad than we are Berlin.” Elizabeth Kassinis, Caritas’ executive manager, said the Abbasses’ experience is not uncommon. “Many are surprised to find out where they actually are. When we tell them, they are shocked, stunned, completely speechless. Nearly all arrive expecting they’ll be within walking distance of a job in Germany.” Illicit crossings from the north have made Cyprus’ woes much worse. Reports have increased in recent months of irregular migrants flying into Ercan airport in the Turkish-controlled breakaway state. Hamstrung by politics, not least Turkey’s refusal to recognise the government in the southern part of Cyprus since its 1974 invasion of the island, authorities are unable to send them back. “Because of the illegal occupation in the north we’ve seen phenomena that wouldn’t happen in conditions of legality,” said Petrides. “It’s an open wound, not just for Cyprus but the entire EU.” With international agencies focusing almost entirely on sea arrivals, the real number of migrants on the island has been hugely underestimated, charities say. “We are a humanitarian organisation that addresses poverty, hunger and homelessness and we are seeing across-the-board increases in them all,” Kassinis said. A backlog of 8,000 asylum claims has amassed as authorities struggle to cope with the flows, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. “We’re talking about a process that can take up to five years and an extremely high number of people waiting for final decisions to their claims,” said Katja Saha, the agency’s representative in Nicosia. “It’s highly likely that the vast majority are not refugees and should not be in the asylum processing system but, that said, the lack of infrastructure and social services makes it very difficult to identify those who are vulnerable, particularly victims of trafficking and torture.” As numbers grow, pressure on the island’s two state-run camps has become immense and asylum seekers are expected to find private accommodation after 72 hours. For most that is nearly impossible when rent allowances are little more than €100 (£90) per person a month and employment is limited to manual work such as car washing and farm labour, Saha said. In Nicosia, which houses one of the camps, asylum seekers have resorted to sleeping in parks and buses and the vestibules of buildings. “For the last month I’ve been in a tent in the park with my wife and four children,” said Basin Hussain, who also fled Iraq. “The first three days were spent in the reception centre but then we were told to leave.” There are fears the drama being played out in the eastern Mediterranean will get a lot worse if the situation in Syria deteriorates further and war extends to Idlib, the country’s last rebel stronghold. A Turkish-Russian ceasefire deal is currently sustaining a fragile peace in the province. Cyprus had been spared the refugee crisis until this year as most Europe-bound asylum seekers headed for Greece and Italy instead. “It’s surprising, given its geographic location, that Cyprus has not been more impacted by the seven-year conflict,” said Saha. “Since the spring we’ve seen this increase in Syrians because word has spread that Lebanon and Turkey, as first asylum countries, are saturated.” As elsewhere in Europe the island is not immune to hostility toward the new arrivals. Far-right groups coalescing around the ultranationalist ELAM party have gained increasing popularity as the issue provides fodder for their approval ratings ahead of European parliamentary elections next year. “What we don’t want to do is open more and more reception centres,” said Petrides, emphasising that solidarity was now needed on Europe’s eastern edge. “It’s not the solution, either for the country or asylum seekers.”"
2018-11-19T07:00:23Z,'Cages are more dignified': Colombia brings cold comfort for Venezuelans,"The feet of Estilita López, 78 years old, are bloodied and bruised from the arduous journey from Yaracuy, in northern Venezuela, to Bogotá, the Colombian capital. Together with 460 fellow compatriots, she now lives in a new, city-funded migrant camp that has just sprung up on a football pitch near the airport. “I had to leave Venezuela, but this is all there is for us here,” says López, taking shelter from the beating sun in the yellow tent she shares with her daughter and grandchildren as clothes soaked by an earlier downpour dry out on the grass nearby. “We’re waiting to eat something, and I need to see a doctor about my feet.” Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with rampant shortages in staple foods and basic medicines. Hyperinflation has rendered the currency practically worthless, and crime is widespread. The dire situation has triggered an exodus of Venezuelans, arguably the largest mass migration in Latin America’s history. Three million have now fled Venezuela, with more than a million in neighbouring Colombia, where opportunities are scarce according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. City officials estimate that more than 250,000 Venezuelans are living in Bogotá. Just a few blocks from the bus terminal, where many people arrive with only what they can carry, roughly 300 refugees and migrants had established a shantytown overlooking a sewage-strewn canal. Concerned by reports of crime and disease outbreaks, the authorities shut down that camp and opened the new one, where López now sleeps, on Tuesday. “I lived in the old camp for two weeks,” she says. “I was getting more sick every day there, it was disgusting.” Despite better conditions in the new camp, which has showers, portable toilets, and visiting doctors, the field floods during downpours. With the rainy season approaching, some worry about about the health of the refugees. “It’ll turn into a quagmire when the rains come,” says Ricardo Moscoso, who lives in an upmarket apartment building overlooking the camp. “There’s no heating and no real sanitation there … there are cages that are more dignified than this.” María Gabriela Ruiz, 22, fled Venezuela last year with her boyfriend and had been living in an apartment while working odd jobs across the city. Now, seven months pregnant and unable to find work, she lives in the camp. “I don’t feel like a refugee, I feel more like a prisoner,” she says as a group of boisterous teenagers play tag around her. “We have to wait to be given food, and sometimes it doesn’t even arrive … last night, I went to bed hungry.” The camp is not accepting new arrivals, leading many homeless Venezuelans to beg officials at the gate to bring them some food. Despite the hardship, camp residents say it is still better than what they left behind in Venezuela. “There’s no food on the shelves back home, at least here we have food and water,” says Jesus Rafael Brazón, 45, who fled Monagas, in eastern Venezuela, three months ago with 14 members of his family. He too made much of the journey on foot. “In Venezuela I started working as a taxi driver, but now there aren’t even the parts available for repairs.” Brazon, though grateful for the reception he has received in the camp, says he is desperately seeking the right to work. “It’s the only thing that will really help us,” he says. “We need to be able to work, to support ourselves.” Enrique Peñalosa, Bogotá’s mayor, has called on the government to nationalise Venezuelans. “It would be a huge help, not just from a humanitarian point of view but also an economic one,” says Cristina Vélez Valencia, Bogotá’s secretary for social integration. “Many of the people arriving are young people, so it would be a huge demographic boost to have them in the workforce.” Vélez added that the plan is to shut the camp down in January, though what happens after that remains uncertain. “We’re looking at other options,” she says, adding that more permanent refuges for short-term residents are being set up in buildings across the city. “What we don’t want is to keep opening more and more camps.”"
2018-11-11T05:59:02Z,Shameful neglect of child refugees | Letters,"Mark Townsend draws attention to the shockingly low numbers of unaccompanied child refugees accepted into the UK by the Home Office (“Just 20 lone child refugees given a new home in UK”, News). In 2016, I spent two periods of two weeks working in a medical capacity in the Calais “jungle”. Ahmed, aged 12, came to see me with minor injuries sustained from falling off the back of a truck in an attempt to cross the Channel. “Why did you leave Afghanistan?” I asked. Through an interpreter he replied: “My father came to Calais five years ago and managed to get on a truck to Dover. He worked in London for four years, then the police caught him and deported him. On arrival in Kabul he was shot by the Taliban. My uncle said it wasn’t safe for me to remain in Afghanistan. He sold some land and gave the money to some men at the border with Iran to bring me to Calais.” “How long did it take to get here?” “Three months.” “Which countries did you pass through?” “I don’t know.” “How long have you been here?” “Nine months.” “How many times have you tried to get to the UK?” “About nine times a week.” When I asked refugees in Calais why they particularly wanted to come to the UK, one reason they gave was that the UK is seen as the most welcoming of countries. “You welcomed the Jews during the last war, the Ugandan Asians fleeing Idi Amin, the Vietnamese boat people.” And now…? I weep. Dr Nick Maurice Marlborough, Wiltshire Only 20 unaccompanied children have been allowed into the UK under a scheme begun more than two years ago to resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa. Twenty. Words fail me. Ruth Eversley Barton Well, Paulton, Somerset Reading through elements of last weekend’s Observer, one could be forgiven for thinking that this is what it must have been like reading the paper in the early 1930s: the UK blocking the resettlement of thousands of vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones; KKK supporters marching through Newtownards, Northern Ireland; the rise of white supremacists in the US; the rise of the far right in Italy; the threat of financial instability across Europe and the encouragement for far-right nationalist political parties this is creating; and social tensions between Roma and Pakistani communities in northern England. There is an urgent need for our moral guardians – in politics, academia and the media – to cohere around and campaign on a counter-narrative that can reverse this steady drift towards racism, nationalism and totalitarianism that our mainstream political systems are orchestrating. Dr Charlie Cooper Lincoln War graves not racist Christopher Fountain (Letters) uses one experience to draw incorrect inferences. He points out that in a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery there are graves of Indian soldiers marked “An Indian Soldier of the Great War” and concludes that this was a racist approach to these gallant men. If one visits a war grave in France, one finds three classes of memorial: stone walls with the names of those with no grave (the majority, including my great uncle), graves containing one or more bodies with names and graves containing a body with no name. The last two can be mixed. On gravestones, British troops are often not named and Indian troops are named where possible. Yes, racism was endemic, but the same rules applied in death to both British and Indian troops. Alan Cameron Blackpool No place for hunting Barbara Ellen is correct: trail hunting does not exist and never has done (“Let’s cut to the chase about hunting and how it brazenly flouts the law”, Comment). It is a convenient alibi for illegal hunting and unfortunately is all too often taken as fact. Hunting is a cruel and outdated pastime, with no place in a civilised country. The sooner an outright ban on hunting with hounds is passed, the better for all. Tom Fitton, Greens for Animal Protection Orpington, Kent Too late, Tony Laudable though Tony Blair’s recent energetic efforts to try to reverse Brexit have been, he’s 20 years too late (“Labour MPs, don’t flirt with a ‘lesser evil’ Brexit deal”, Comment). He had 10 years as prime minister in which to educate the British public on the virtues of the EU and membership of it but, in common with his prime ministerial predecessors and successors, he did not manage to fit such a process into his agenda. I cannot recall him ever taking the time to promote the EU to the electorate. When British membership of the eurozone was being debated, the final decision was effectively delegated to Gordon Brown and the inevitable negative conclusion merely conveyed to the public a negative government attitude towards the EU. So, too late Tony, and you must also accept some blame for the pickle in which we now are in relation to the EU. Phil Richards Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire Yes, society affects the mind In her fascinating article, Lorna Martin writes that her “medical records state baldly that I had mental health problems. But now I wonder how much was out-of-synch brain chemicals and how much was caused by our psychologically dysfunctional society” (“Therapy gave me a voice and inspired a TV show”, Focus). These two explanations are not mutually exclusive: a dysfunctional society affects our bodies and brain chemicals in dysfunctional ways and our brain chemicals influence how we feel and interact with society. We are fundamentally networked creatures in constant biological and psychological communication with our surroundings. Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry Trinity College, Dublin Britain not to blame Patience Akumu lays the blame for Tanzanian officials’ action against homosexual activity in the country on Britain, its colonial service and laws (“A tainted imperial legacy that fuels the oppression of gay people in Africa”, Comment). Tanzania gained independence on 9 December 1961; I was there. Blaming the lawmakers of well over half a century ago for today’s events is an insult to them, to the Tanzanian legislators of the intervening years and to the people of Tanzania for being incapable of assuming responsibility for their own laws and institutions. I have lived and worked in the country for some years since and the essence of fair and just law is more evident there than in many other African countries. Paul Carlin Dromore, County Down Wrong side of the track I have sympathy with Anthony Walker in his protest about there being no railway station in Leigh, Lancashire or Washington, Tyne and Wear (Letters). However, the largest town without a railway connection has for many years been my home town: Gosport, Hampshire, population 85,000, and it’s in the south-east! To get anywhere from Gosport by public transport, you have two options: get a bus to Fareham station, six miles along gridlocked roads, or take a short but expensive ferry ride to Portsmouth Harbour station.

2018-06-01T14:20:33Z,Italy vows to 'send home' undocumented immigrants,"Italy’s interior minister, the far-right firebrand Matteo Salvini, has declared that one of the new populist government’s top priorities will be to “send them home”, signalling that he intends to keep a campaign promise to round up hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants in Italy. The political chaos that has engulfed Italy in recent weeks has centred on questions about whether the government, which was sworn in on Friday and is led by the virtually unknown prime minister Giuseppe Conte, will take a tough line on Italy’s fiscal commitments in Brussels. But Salvini’s rise to power, from talk-radio host on his party’s show to his appointment to one of Italy’s most powerful government positions, with oversight of domestic security, civil rights, immigration and asylum and elections, could force more dramatic change. Hours after the government was approved by the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, Salvini said Italy was going to take a tougher approach. “Open doors in Italy for good people and a one-way ticket for those who come to Italy to create commotion and think they will be taken care of. ‘Send them home’ will be one of our top priorities,” he said. Salvini, who is head of the far-right League, a nationalist party that used to favour secession, campaigned on a pledge to deport about 500,000 migrantsliving illegally in Italy. While the rhetoric caused concern among migration experts and humanitarian groups, it was seen as a highly unrealistic agenda, because Italy did not have the resources or legal flexibility to pursue costly mass deportations. Migration experts contacted by the Guardian are nevertheless alarmed by Salvini’s promotion. They fear that the rights of asylum seekers, migrants and refugees will be dramatically eroded in a country that is already struggling to accommodate and integrate the new arrivals into Italian communities. Calogero Santoro is the head of Girasoli, a non-profit organisation that promotes the integration of migrants and refugees in local communities in Sicily. He said: “Fake news about migrants have spread all over Italy during the last campaign. My concern is the future of asylum seekers, people who are eligible for a refugee status. What will happen to them under [Salvini’s] League?” Santoro added: “This is what scares me. The previous government’s deal with Tripoli is making the lives of these people harder and harder in Libya and now Salvini could make their life impossible in Italy too.” Santoro was referring to an agreement between Italy and Libya in which Italians helped to train Libyan coast guards, who have stopped migrant boats and taken people fleeing to Europe back to camps in Libya. The agreement has been condemned by human rights advocates. Multiple reports have described inhumane conditions, rape and other physical abuse. Migration experts are also worried by the possibility that Salvini could reduce funding for reception centres – which have already been criticised by human right groups for poor conditions – and make life even more inhospitable for migrants. “My fear is that Italy’s reception centres will be transformed into little Calais ‘Jungles’ that will make migrants invisible to the public,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo. Salvini has also suggested he would seek to convert reception centres into detention centres and divert funds to be used for mass deportations. Under current rules, every migrant who is deported by plane must be escorted by two Italian agents, at an estimated cost of €3,000 (£2,600) per migrant. A recent study by L’Espresso found that Salvini’s plan to deport 500,000 migrants would cost roughly €1.5bn. Pierre Vimont, a French career diplomat, who works at the Carnegie Europe thinktank, said Italy’s government could be in violation of international and EU refugee law if it follows through with its pledge to send hundreds of thousands of migrants back to their country of origin, potentially breaching the Geneva convention. “If the new Italian government says: ‘I don’t care, I don’t want to accept any refugees’, they may be in contradiction and in violation of this international convention,” he said, referring to the principle of non refoulement, which forbids states from sending refugees back to areas where they may be in danger. Vimont, who led European negotiations on an EU-Africa fund aimed at deterring migrants, said it was “a bit ludicrous” for the government to think they had the answers to problems that had eluded other European governments for 20 years. “The whole problem about the populist approach is that it is pretending and has convinced the electorate that things can be managed quickly and that quick solutions can happen just like that. And on migration more than anything else, this has never been the case,” Vimont added. Sandro Gozi, Italy’s former Europe minister, said the EU had given ammunition to anti-immigration populist parties by not helping Italy deal with large numbers of arrivals. “Europe could and should have done more,” Gozi told the Guardian in a recent interview. “The fact that the Italians feel they have been left alone has fuelled the populists’ agenda.” The EU has spent more than two years trying to overhaul its asylum law, known as the Dublin regulation. Deep divisions remain over proposals for relocation of refugees from one EU state to another. Central and eastern European states, led by Poland and Hungary, say they could never accept mandatory quotas, while southern states, such as Greece and Italy, argue that they are being left to bear the brunt. The issue is heading for a crunch point in June, after a deadline was imposed by the European council president, Donald Tusk, to reach an agreement or abandon mandatory quotas altogether. “Delays in the implementation of the relocation mechanism have been politically devastating,” Gozi said. “Not because relocation would have solved in itself the migration crisis, but because it showed the Visegrád Group did not want to pay any price.” Bulgaria, which is handling negotiations, is trying to move countries towards a compromise but Mediterranean states are unhappy about a perceived climbdown on compulsory quotas. “We are going backwards on solidarity and responsibility,” said an EU diplomat."
2018-12-30T13:45:57Z,UK migrant ‘crisis’ bears no comparison to EU's 2015 influx,"The recent rise in the number of people attempting to cross the Channel to England from France has been referred to as a “migrant crisis”. However, the numbers are minuscule compared to the height of the EU’s 2015 crisis, when 10,000 people landed in a single day in Greece. More than 220 people have attempted the Channel crossing since the start of November, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary, cut short a family holiday to deal with what he has called a “major incident.” Charities and international humanitarian groups say they have witnessed an increased number of Iranians trying to make the crossing in recent months. In the latest incident, six Iranian men were found on a beach in Kingsdown, near Deal in Kent, on Sunday. Three years ago, Europe’s biggest inflow of migrants and refugees since the second world war was taking place. Up to 220,000 people arrived in Europe by boat in 2014, and more than 900,000 in 2015. The number of people landing in Greece rose from 43,000 in 2014 to more than 750,000 in 2015, while arrivals in Italy dropped slightly from 170,000 to roughly 144,000. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees forced Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras to beg for help as islands equipped to deal with a small annual influx of tourists were overwhelmed. The numbers started to fall after a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people each year are still trying to reach Europe. By November, Spain had taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500, according to the UNHCR. The pressure on Greece may have subsided slightly since 2015, but overland arrivals in the year to date have risen to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period in 2017. The Channel numbers are also small in the context of wider UK immigration and asylum statistics. According to Home Office data released at the end of November, 7,444 people claimed asylum in the third quarter of this year, of whom people crossing the Channel made up a very small percentage. Far larger numbers arrive by plane seeking asylum from countries like Uganda and DRC but get little media coverage."
2018-12-01T08:00:16Z,Migrants at Mexico border face an uncertain future on their own,"Authorities in Tijuana have started to relocate more than 6,000 Central Americans to a new shelter, after the rundown sports centre where they have been camped out for more than two weeks descended into squalor. Torrential rains this week have compounded the migrants’ misery, flooding the crowded sports complex where they sleep shoulder-to-shoulder in tents and shelters made from cardboard, garbage bags and blankets. Gustavo Alocer, a representative from Mexico’s human rights commission, described the situation as a humanitarian crisis, while UNICEF has said that it is “deeply concerned” for the well-being of more than 1,000 children who arrived in the string of migrant caravans. Meanwhile, the collective momentum which brought the migrants safely through Mexico has dissipated, as caravan members face the dawning realisation that they may be stuck here for months – and that they will make their next steps alone. “Some of the people have opted to go back home, but many are in the process of applying for visas to stay in Mexico or are planning to wait for asylum in the United States – and they need to be cared for,” said Alocer. Around 350 migrants have opted to be deported back to their home countries. But most are planning to stay in Mexico while they plot their next steps. Many of the migrants admit frankly that, when they set out, they had no real strategy beyond reaching the US border. “I didn’t really have much of a plan when I left Honduras: everyone said that we would be able to cross the border – I thought it would be easier,” said 29-year-old Yocelyn Alvarado as she picked up her 3-year-old son Fernando to stop him wondering into vast puddle of stinking floodwater and sodden trash. They were among the last to arrive at the centre, and the only spot they could find was next to a stinking row of portable toilets. “My son is always sick here,” said Alvarado. “if he’s not vomiting, he has diarrhea and a persistent cough. I want to wait for asylum, but now I’m thinking I’ll arrange my paperwork to stay in Mexico and get a job.” Many of the migrants headed North to escape gang violence or political intimidation in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, and had hoped to apply for asylum in the US. But US border authorities limit asylum applications at the San Ysidro border crossing to between 40 and 100 per day, and thousands of people are trapped in the bottleneck. Even before the caravans arrived, an unofficial waiting list managed by migrants themselves had about 3,000 names, and the waiting time to start an asylum application was about a month. Now, the list has ballooned to over 5,000 and the waiting time has doubled Not all the migrants plan to apply for asylum – either because they cannot prove that their lives are in danger or because they are fleeing economic hardship rather than violence. Many of those are now weighing staying in Tijuana, turning back home, or crossing the US border illegally. Outside the shelter, Carlos Alfaro, a 33-year-old construction worker said his neighbourhood in San Salvador, was on the front line between territory claimed by rival gangs. “You can’t cross the street because if you move from one gang’s territory to the other, they’ll kill you. Because I live on the line, they both want to kill me,” he said. But he had no way to prove his story, and knew that he had little hope of claiming asylum. “I guess I’ll stay in Tijuana and find a job. Then we’ll see – at this point I’d rather be in jail in the US than in my country.” Some migrants – unwilling to wait two months to start an asylum application or unable to pay a $3000-$10,000 smuggler’s fee price, have simply been trying to cross into the US on their own. Several groups have trekked down to Tijuana beach, hoping to find a way to slip through holes in the border fence, or clamber over the extra layers of concertina wire the Trump administration has added in recent weeks. Relocating the migrants to the new shelter, has made such efforts more difficult. Situated in one of Tijuana’s most dangerous neighborhoods, the building – a disused concert venue – is more than 15 miles from the US border."
2018-05-29T16:53:05Z,Hungary to criminalise migrant helpers with ‘Stop Soros’ legislation,"Viktor Orbán’s government has introduced a controversial set of laws to the Hungarian parliament, known informally as the “Stop Soros” plan, that would impose jail terms on people or organisations deemed to be aiding illegal immigration. The legislation was a key promise of Orbán’s Fidesz party before elections last month. Fidesz won with a two-thirds majority, meaning the bill and a number of constitutional amendments can be passed without hitches. The bill is known as “Stop Soros” because it targets some organisations funded by the financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom Orbán’s government has demonised for the past year as the main backer of illegal migration to Europe. Rights activists have been worried about the bill because of the potential for any NGOs working to give legal or other aid to migrants arriving at Hungary’s borders to fall under the definition of supporting illegal migration. The text of the legal amendments, published late on Tuesday, did not contain a number of controversial provisions from previous drafts, which stipulated that NGOs working on migration would be subject to national security checks and a 25% tax on foreign funding. However, it is unclear, given that the new law speaks of prison terms for those deemed to be aiding illegal migration, if the absence of those provisions indicates a climbdown. “Those who provide financial means … or conduct this organisational activity on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison,” read part of the law. “This is a legal framework and it will be up to the courts to decide how they will qualify certain activities,” said Csaba Dömötör, state secretary, at a press conference on Tuesday. Additional provisions make it impossible for anyone to claim asylum in Hungary if they passed through a country deemed safe prior to their arrival. The UN’s refugee agency said the package of laws, if passed, would “deprive people who are forced to flee their homes of critical aid and services, and further inflame tense public discourse and rising xenophobic attitudes”. Human Rights Watch has called for Fidesz to be expelled from the European People’s party grouping in the European parliament if the package is passed. The EPP, made up mainly of centre-right parties, has been tolerant of Orbán’s centralising impulses and populist campaigns, but its leaders have reportedly told the party’s leadership that there are certain red lines, including the closure of a Soros-founded university in Hungary. Since 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through Hungary en route to western Europe, Orbán has based his political programme on harsh anti-migrant sentiment. He ordered the construction of a fence at the border between Hungary and Serbia, and his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament last month after campaigning almost exclusively on an anti-migrant platform. Earlier on Tuesday, Soros spoke in Paris to a gathering of foreign policy experts and suggested Europe needed to do more to support democratic governments in Africa to reduce the number of migrants fleeing them. He described a Europe in crisis, but accused populists of exploiting the situation. “The whole of Europe has been disrupted by the refugee crisis. Unscrupulous leaders have exploited it even in countries that have accepted hardly any refugees. In Hungary, Victor Orbán based his re-election campaign on falsely accusing me of planning to flood Europe, Hungary included, with Muslim refugees,” Soros said."
2018-10-25T08:00:03Z,Is the US in an 'illegal' immigration crisis? Border patrol data suggests otherwise,"Donald Trump rails against an “onslaught of illegal aliens” possibly including MS-13 gang members and “Middle Easterners” poised to invade the US; news organizations cover the slow progress of a migrant caravan heading through Mexico as if it were a looming hurricane; humanitarian workers from California to Texas struggle to provide shelter for an unprecedented number of families released from border patrol holding cells. Going by the headlines of the day, you might be forgiven for thinking that the US is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis of illegal migration across its southern frontier. But illegal border crossings have declined significantly from record highs in the early years of the 21st century. According to the latest statistics from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), 396,579 undocumented people were apprehended after entering the country illegally in 2018. Another 124,511 people presented themselves at ports of entry, many seeking humanitarian protection, but immigration officials found them inadmissible. In 2000, however, more than 1.6 million illegal border crossers were apprehended. In 2001, the figure was 1.3 million. In the early 2000s, the largest group of undocumented migrants caught entering the US were Mexican men crossing to work. When caught, border patrol sent them back without long-term detention or court proceedings. Many crossed again and again and some eventually succeeded in evading border enforcement. The high apprehension numbers certainly include many individuals caught and counted more than once. Small ups and downs in the flow continued until a significant drop off at the end of the decade – from 556,041 in 2009 to 340,252 in 2011 – coinciding with the great recession, and the disappearance of the jobs many migrants came for. In the following years, apprehension numbers continued to fluctuate between 350,000-500,000, with a low of 310,531 in 2017. Observers attribute that steep decline to economic growth in Mexico, ramped-up border enforcement, and the “Trump effect”, which deterred some migrants. But as the numbers of Mexican immigrants decreased, more Central Americans – including unaccompanied teenagers, single parents with children and entire families – crossed the border, many of them fleeing conditions of extreme violence. Young people fled gang recruitment, persecution by police working with organized crime, and threats of rape and death. Mothers and fathers undertook the arduous journey to escape the dangers posed by corrupt officials, gangs and security forces. Families also fled conditions of extreme poverty, multiple crop failures exacerbated by climate change and moribund economies void of jobs. Unlike adults crossing the border looking for work, families with children and individuals seeking asylum cannot be deported quickly; asylum takes months and years in immigration court. Adults are often detained for the duration of the legal process, but current law forbids the government from detaining children for long periods. The government can detain families together, but it doesn’t have nearly enough space to hold all of the families now coming. CBP apprehension statistics released on Tuesday for fiscal year 2018 show steep increases in recent months – mostly families with children – a total of 16,658 people in September alone. Here on the border, Trump’s hardline rhetoric collides with the reality of thousands of refugee families already here who cannot be imprisoned indefinitely, nor can they be quickly removed, at least according to current law. Churches and other volunteers gladly shelter those set free because the government’s immigration prisons are full. Having failed to build his wall, Trump will ramp up construction of detention camps for families and children. Radical anti-immigrant bureaucrats in the executive branch will find new ways to criminalize refugees, separate children from parents, and deploy military personnel on the border. People will keep walking – and they will follow a northern star. Molly Molloy is a border and Latin America specialist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico"
2018-09-03T09:41:49Z,"Sharp rise in proportion of migrants dying in Mediterranean, says UN","Fewer people are making the journey across the Mediterranean to Europe, but the proportion of those losing their lives while trying has risen sharply, the UN refugee agency has said in its latest report. The UNHCR said 1,095 people died on the central Mediterranean route, mainly from Libya to Italy, between January and July this year, amounting to one death for every 18 arrivals. This compares with 2,276 last year, or one death for every 42 arrivals. In June, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals, the agency said, adding that there had been 10 incidents so far this year in which 50 or more people died, most of them after leaving Libya and seven of them since June. “The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,” said Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean. More than 300 people had also died so far in 2018 along the sea route from North Africa to Spain, the UNHCR said – a 50% increase on 2017, when 200 deaths were recorded for the whole year. In April, when more than 1,200 reached Spain by sea, the death rate was one in 14. “With the number of people arriving in Europe falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives,” UNHCR’s Europe bureau director, Pascale Moreau, said. Migration into Europe is down sharply from its 2015-16 peak, but the bloc remains divided over how to handle new arrivals. The interests of “frontline” southern states, such as Italy and Greece, are diametrically opposed to those of northern “destination” states, and some hardline, populist leaders are refusing to take any refugees at all. Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has said his country will “no longer be Europe’s refugee camp”, and sparked a series of diplomatic rows by refusing to allow migrant rescue ships to dock in Italian ports unless other EU states agreed to take in those onboard. Salvini and the equally hardline Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said after meeting in Milan last week they were “walking down the same path” in opposing what they called the “pro-migration policies” of the European commission and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. The UN migration agency, IOM, has demanded a “predictable, regional approach” for the rescue and disembarkation of people recovered in the Mediterranean, and the UNHCR is calling for Europe to provide increased access to safe, legal pathways for refugees by boosting resettlement places and cutting obstacles to family reunification. Cochetel said Europe needed to come together and “take the lead”, avoiding anti-migrant rhetoric and understanding that numbers were sharply down and migrant flows manageable at current levels. The UNHCR also outlined the dangers refugees face travelling to or within Europe by land, saying 78 deaths had been recorded so far this year along land routes in Europe or at Europe’s borders, compared with 45 in the same period last year."
2018-12-25T14:24:09Z,Migrants stuck in Tijuana dream of US as they celebrate uncertain Christmas,"“For us Christmas means tamales,” said Orbelina Orellana, mixing a cauldron of ingredients with a large wooden ladle. In the background, punta music, from Honduras’s northern coast, played from a cellphone lying next to a pile of banana leaves that would later be used to wrap the traditional corn dish. “It’s more than food: it’s family, it’s home, it’s love, it’s us.” Orellana is one of the thousands of Central Americans who arrived in Tijuana, just south of US border with the US state of California, in November. She came with the caravan of migrants and refugees who are spending their Christmas thousands of miles from home, in limbo, many of whom are unsure if or when they will ever make it into the US. In preparation for 24 December, when Latin America celebrates Christmas, Orellana and three other women made 2,000 Honduran tamales in an empty dirt-floor lot with cinderblock walls, just around the corner from the old outdoor concert venue that is housing more than 1,200 caravan members. “We wanted our new caravan family to be able to have our traditions. But being here is hard. I know my son and two daughters are sad right now. I keep reminding myself I’m here for their future,” Orellana, 26, says as she stirs, remembering her children back in Honduras. “They’re all pretty reserved kids, but on Christmas, they love to dance. I’ll miss that.” Throughout Tijuana, volunteers and organizations from around the city and across the border have also been doing their best to inspire holiday spirits. In front of the camp on Saturday, 25 cooks organized by chef Armando Rodiel were preparing Christmas paella for the migrants over wood stoves – a feat that required 1,600 pounds of chicken and pork, 800 pounds of rice, 400 pounds of olive oil, three weeks of planning and one specially ordered seven-foot-wide paella pan. Inside the camp, older men crouched around small shin-high tables playing cards and listening to reggaeton while younger men played soccer using a donated goal. The previous day, church groups from San Diego came to perform a mass for families and prayed over a group of men who lined up between the tents that have become their homes. A meal of egg strata and roasted carrots prepared by chef José Andrés’s organization, World Central Kitchen, was served before mariachis performed. A small group of barbers and pedicurists from Berkeley, California, came down to offer grooming before the big day. Across town, at another shelter housing some 400 members of the caravan, Migrant Vision, a group led by Haitians who themselves arrived in the city two years ago, doled out plates of eggs, rice and beans followed by bags of donated clothes and toys for children. Men with Santa hats crowded around a charging station with their phones as volunteers sang Christmas carols behind them and a group of smiling boys from Honduras played with their new firetrucks. Despite the sheen of holiday cheer, the season’s nostalgia seems to have increased the already palpable undercurrent of disheartenment, disappointment, boredom and anxiety felt by some of the migrants still in the shelters, many of whom did not think they would still be in Tijuana after leaving Central America in mid-October. For several, it is their first Christmas away from loved ones. “We normally have 20 family members over for Christmas and an open door for friends. I make 300 tamales,” said María Reyes, 40, who traveled alone with her four daughters and granddaughter from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and is waiting to apply for asylum in the US. “I say I’m fine, because what choice do I have … I really thought I’d be in the US by now. I don’t know what happens next.” Meanwhile, the gears of the immigration process keep grinding. The first of the caravan to arrive in Tijuana, mostly members of the LGBT community, have started to cross into the US and ask for asylum. A group of trans women was the first to enter last week. While a handful have been released, at least 30 remain in detention in Pearsall, Texas, and in Cibola county, New Mexico, according to lawyers who say they have not been able to contact the women. On Saturday Erick Dubón and Pedro Nehemías de León, one of eight LGBT couples to marry in Tijuana last month waited to cross the border and were resigned to spending Christmas detained. “I’m so nervous, I couldn’t sleep last night,” Erick said as he bit down on his nearly gone thumbnail. “I – we’ve – been through so much, but what if I can’t communicate my story in the right way?” His phone rings. It’s his mom calling to say gang members had beaten his brother and threatened to kill him. Erick said nothing for two minutes, just biting his nails. “Should I try and print photos so they believe me? I can’t even right now,” he huffed taking a seat on the curb. The plan the Trump administration announced last Thursday to make asylum seekers remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed in the US has not yet started in Tijuana. City officials say they do not know when or how the plan will be implemented. “I don’t know when it’s starting. All I know is what’s in the news. I’m worried,” said César Palencia, head of migrant affairs in the city. “Tijuana isn’t prepared for this. There isn’t shelter space. There’s no money allocated for it. The government is adventuring without really understanding the reality of what it has accepted.” On Christmas Eve, Luis García, a 33-year-old construction worker from southern Honduras unwrapped his second tamal. “Yeah, I heard about that plan for us to stay here,” he said. “I don’t really understand, but a group of us – five – have decided to cross the fence tonight.”"
2018-12-20T18:04:24Z,Medical colleges criticise charging migrants upfront for NHS care,"Representatives of more than 70,000 doctors have urged ministers to suspend regulations that force hospitals to charge overseas visitors upfront for NHS care. Three royal medical colleges and one faculty say the charging regime is harming people’s health by deterring them from seeking NHS help when they fall ill. Payments in advance are “a concerning barrier to care”, they say. They have voiced particular concern about pregnant women being denied care and children missing out on treatment for life or death illnesses. Their plea is the strongest opposition yet from the medical community to hospitals in England being compelled to charge migrants up to tens of thousands of pounds before they treat them. The statement has been signed by the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Faculty of Public Health. They want Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, to suspend regulations brought in in 2015 and 2017 that specify when overseas visitors should be charged for receiving NHS care. Charges should not be enforced until a full independent review is undertaken of how they are affecting migrants’ access to healthcare, the four groups say. Citing evidence of mothers-to-be and children being left without medical aid, the colleges say: “We do not believe that regulations that lead to such situations are appropriate. They are having a direct impact on individual health and have potential implications for wider public health. “Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to improve patients’ outcomes and – in the case of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV – to protect public health.” Some patients have been wrongly charged because they could not prove they were entitled to free care, the statement adds. Charging migrants in advance for care threatens to weaken the bonds of trust that should exist between doctors and patients, the four groups say. “The role of doctors in this process has the potential to damage the vital trust between us and our patients, and is likely to lead to poorer outcomes and contribute to already low morale in our profession.” Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the British Medical Association and the former NHS England chief executive David Nicholson have all previously voiced their unease about the regulations. Groups campaigning against the charges, such as the health NGO Medact and Doctors of the World, welcomed the colleges’ move. “These short-sighted, poorly implemented policies around upfront charging are a step backwards in the fight for good public health and universal healthcare. Everyone has the right to healthcare, regardless of immigration status, and intimidating patients to stay away from hospital under the guise of cost-saving on the back of eight years of under-funding has no place in the NHS,” said Joanna Dobbin, a junior doctor and a member of Medact’s migrant solidarity group. Prof Shirley Hodgson, a cancer specialist, said the “harsh” charges were in breach of the NHS’s founding duty to provide universal healthcare. “It is unconscionable to ask health workers to act as gatekeepers for medical services, putting them in a position to decide who is eligible for healthcare and who is not,” she said."
2018-12-19T21:18:05Z,Theresa May will be ‘forced to back down’ over migrant curbs,"Rebellious ministers believe Theresa May will be forced to allow workers earning at least £21,000 to enter the UK after Brexit in the face of intense lobbying from businesses demanding the right to employ low-skilled workers from abroad. The prime minister had wanted to limit the vast majority of immigration to people with jobs paid £30,000 and over, but had already had to concede there would be a further year of consultation on the threshold after a cabinet revolt. And within hours of the publication of the government’s long-awaited immigration white paper on Wednesday, uproar from business groups over the proposals deepened the cracks in what had been intended as one of the flagship policies for May’s vision of post-Brexit Britain. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Greg Clark, business secretary, who led the revolt, now expect employers’ groups to lobby hard to slash the prime minister’s preferred £30,000 threshold. The white paper sets out how free movement from the EU will end after 2021. Free movement is widely regarded as one of the key reasons for the Brexit vote. The document proposes a skills-based system that makes no distinction between EU and non-EU countries, but the cabinet standoff meant that no final decision on the all-important salary threshold could be reached. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, presenting the white paper, told the Commons that the original £30,000 level proposed by the independent Migration Advisory Committee was “not set in stone”. Conceding that ministers needed to do further work, Javid added: “We will have to have more engagement to ensure that we get it right and come up with a threshold that we believe works for all parts of the UK.” One cabinet source said that given the pressure from employers they expected the final outcome “to be likely to be closer to £21,000 than £30,000”. Allies of Hammond said he was “very content” with the outcome and looked forward to the consultation taking its course. Home Office officials also refused to predict whether the new regime would reduce immigration, saying that future migration levels would depend on a range of factors that were hard to predict. That reticence echoed Javid’s own refusal to repeat May’s 2017 election manifesto pledge to bring net migration down to “tens of thousands” in a morning radio interview on the BBC. When asked directly if the target of “tens of thousands” had been abandoned, Javid would only say: “What was clear from the manifesto was our commitment to bring net migration down.” The goal of cutting net migration – the difference between the annual number of people arriving in the UK versus the number leaving – was set by David Cameron’s coalition government in 2010. The target has never been met, with annual net migration standing at about 244,000. The white paper itself refers indirectly to May’s long-held target. It said the government is still committed to “reduce annual net migration to sustainable levels as set out in the Conservative party manifesto”. Downing Street has been trying to get the immigration white paper published for a year, believing that the introduction of strict border controls is a trump card at a time when May is struggling to persuade rebellious MPs to sign off on her Brexit deal reached with the EU. Insiders believe publishing the document remains an important achievement given how contentious the subject has been within government. No 10 sources also argued that the prime minister was following the advisory committee recommendation, which had originally floated the £30,000 figure. Business organisations immediately began the next phase of lobbying, voicing concerns about the effect of the £30,000 salary threshold on the British economy, which has sucked in lower-paid workers from the EU in the past two decades. Josh Hardie, the deputy director of the CBI, said: “Hospitals, housebuilders and retailers are all struggling to find the people they need at salaries well below £30,000. These proposals must change.” Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), warned that seven in 10 small employers relied on mid- or low-skilled staff who could be disqualified from working in Britain if the £30,000 limit was used. “Getting this threshold wrong will cause serious disruption to the economy. With the employment rate at a record high, small firms are already struggling to access the skills they need,” said Cherry. Sectors such as construction and social care, where low pay predominates and employers have become particularly reliant on EU workers, are among those highlighted as likely to be affected. Brian Berry, the chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, which represents construction firms, complained about the “obsession with salary thresholds” and said the £30,000 figure “was met by fierce opposition from almost all sectors” when it was floated by the advisory committee. No 10 had tried and failed to head off the political and business revolt with a pledge to introduce a temporary low-skilled workers scheme, as an insurance policy for the most affected sectors. The transition measure, to be introduced for five years, will allow people with lower-paid jobs to come to the UK for a maximum of 12 months, with a cooling-off period of a further 12 months to prevent people settling in the UK as a result. The new immigration rules are due to be come into force at the end of the post-Brexit transition period, at the beginning of 2021. The long consultation means businesses could have no more than a year to adapt once the threshold is set. An additional “small-scale” scheme for fruit pickers and other seasonal agricultural workers will be trialled in 2019, but no other specific sectors of the economy will be allowed special treatment, the white paper says."
2018-12-19T18:10:41Z,Fleeing home alone: the migrant children blocked at Mexican border,"For years, Dora waited impatiently to turn 15, the age her mother had agreed she would be old enough to leave their home in El Salvador – where she suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her grandfather – and head to the US, in search of a new life. Her goal was to join two older sisters who had resettled in Los Angeles after fleeing the same abuse five years ago. But even after her birthday in May, Dora did not feel ready to brave the hazardous 5,000km journey, until local news reported that a caravan of migrants was heading north – and she decided to set out with a friend of her mother and her two small children. “Seeing them leave together … that gave me hope and gave me the courage to finally leave,” said Dora, who is now living at a children’s shelter in Tijuana, on the border with California. This year, more than 49,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the US border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Jakelin Caal, the seven-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in US custody this month was with her father, but the group they were traveling in included some 50 children who were traveling alone. Most unaccompanied minors come from some of the most dangerous countries in the hemisphere – El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala – but the journey north exposes them to new risks: migrants are often targeted for rape, murder, kidnapping and robbery. Those who survive the journey are not out of danger: bureaucratic hurdles can delay them from pleading their case to US officials – or even prevent them from seeking asylum altogether. Meanwhile, they are forced to wait in border cities that have become battlefields in Mexico’s raging drug war. On Monday night, US border patrol blocked 15 Honduran migrants, including eight unaccompanied children, from seeking asylum at the Otay Mesa port of entry north of Tijuana despite two members of Congress traveling with the group. After four hours, the unaccompanied children were let in while the rest waited to plead their case. As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on migration, the US government has put a limit on the number of people who can apply for asylum each day, a practice known as “metering”. Meanwhile, the Mexican government routinely diverts unaccompanied children into the foster care system or simply deports them – regardless of the dangers they face at home. “It is a timebomb of tensions and vulnerabilities,” said Michelle Brané, the director of the migrant rights and justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission. Brané, who recently visited Tijuana, said metering was creating an especially dangerous situation for children who remain exposed to violence and gang recruitment while they wait to apply for asylum. At some ports of entry, metering has been in place for more than two years, but in the past six months, it has become the standard across the US-Mexico border, according to a report released this month by three research institutes. Nowhere is the precarious situation for unaccompanied children more visible than in Tijuana, which has been overwhelmed by thousands of asylum seekers in the final months of 2018. According to an unofficial list of asylum seekers, some 5,000 people are currently waiting to present their claim, with an average waiting time of 12 weeks, according to the report by the Robert Strauss Center’s Mexico Security Initiative, UC San Diego’s Center for US-Mexican Studies and the Migration Policy Centre. Child protection groups in Tijuana estimate there are hundreds of unaccompanied children in the city, but the figure is hard to confirm because minors traveling alone are hesitant to identify themselves for fear of gangs, traffickers – and the Mexican government. Mexican child protection officers are obliged to take unaccompanied minors into custody, where they are filtered into foster care or deported. “Even if they are lucky enough to get information about the asylum system in Mexico, they very often still don’t have access to actually apply, but then even beyond that, they don’t get any information about the United States,” said Brané. Those unaccompanied children who make it to the San Ysidro port of entry in Tijuana can also still be turned away by US Customs and Border Protection agents. According to Amnesty International, the border patrol has since April turned away at least five unaccompanied children seeking asylum at San Ysidro. DHS said in an emailed statement: “No one is being denied the opportunity to make a claim of credible fear or seek asylum.” But on a visit to Tijuana last month, the US congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, intervened when five asylum seekers, including two unaccompanied children, were stopped from presenting themselves for asylum at the border by US officials. “It shouldn’t take intervention from a Member of Congress and an incredibly compassionate Border Patrol Chief for those fleeing violence and persecution to seek asylum in the United States,” Jayapal tweeted after the incident. When Dora tried to apply for asylum at San Ysidro, she was intercepted by Mexican immigration agents who sent her to the children’s shelter where she now spends the day watching television, playing cards and hanging out with new friends. She is not able to contact her family because their cell service is patchy in the city where they live. She hopes eventually to apply for asylum again. With her dream of reaching Los Angeles just out of reach, Dora said she was still grateful to have escaped the chaotic environment around her grandfather. “When he wasn’t drinking it was fine, but it got to be every day,” said Dora. “He would hit me hard and then when my mom would try to intervene, he would hit her. You never knew exactly what would set him off. Living on edge like that, it’s constant fear and anxiety. I feel much more at peace here, like it’s going to be OK.” But Jenny Villegas, an organizer at the advocacy group Caracen who has been working closely with unaccompanied children in Tijuana, said that many of the youngsters are only just realizing the scale of the risks they still confront. “Some have faced very terrible things on their way, some have been kidnapped by cartels,” Villegas said. “So they are dealing with a lot. And on top of that, they are realizing it’s not as easy as they thought it would be when they got here.” Without adult supervision, unaccompanied children are very vulnerable to gangs and traffickers in Tijuana, where homicides soared to a new high in 2017 because of gang violence. “There are active gangs here who recruit minors,” she said. Many of the unaccompanied children who reach the city are unaware of the risks and obstacles they still face, preoccupied as they are by homesickness and the violence they have left behind. Orlin, 17, and his brother Marcos, 15, described a steady life with their grandparents in Zamora in northern Honduras, until they declined to join a gang – and were given two weeks to leave town. “Honduras is a beautiful country but the gangs make it an ugly place to be,” said Marcos, speaking in the same shelter. “I don’t ever want to go back.” The two brothers had left school before age 10 because the costs of pencils, backpacks and notebooks was too much of a financial burden for their family. “We almost never leave the house because of the gangs – we definitely don’t go out at night, but during the day even we really only go out if we have to run to the store or something,” Orlin said. Orlin has two round scars on his knee and a third on his left thigh from being shot by gang members who robbed him two years ago . “That really shook me,” he said. “Our father had been killed by the gangs and I didn’t want to be next.” The ultimatum from the gangsters came just before the first caravan set out from Honduras. The two brothers have family scattered across the US and said they hope to become fluent in English, work in construction and eventually make their own families. Orlin nodded northwards, towards the US border. “The dream – our dreams – are there.”"
2018-06-13T16:49:31Z,EU migration row boils over as Italy and France trade insults,"France and Italy have traded insults, rifts have widened in Germany’s ruling coalition and Austria has called for an “axis of the willing” to take action as a simmering row over how Europe should handle irregular migration finally boiled over. Rejecting French criticism of its immigration policies, Italy summoned the French ambassador on Wednesday and cancelled a planned meeting between the Italian economy minister and his counterpart in Paris. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was reportedly considering postponing a visit to Paris on Friday for talks with Emmanuel Macron after the French president said Rome had acted with “cynicism and irresponsibility” in turning away a migrant rescue ship. Italy’s hardline new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said the country had “nothing to learn from anyone about generosity, voluntarism, welcoming and solidarity” and demanded a formal apology. Salvini, the leader of the far-right, anti-immigration League party, blocked the Aquarius from entering Italian ports this weekend, prompting an international outcry. The rescue vessel, which is carrying 629 migrants, was also refused by Malta and is now heading to Spain escorted by two Italian ships. The case has reopened one of the main unresolved faultlines in European politics: how to share responsibility for migrants trying to enter the bloc from conflict zones and poor countries, mainly across Africa and the Middle East. More than 1.8 million people have entered Europe irregularly since 2014 and Italy is currently sheltering 170,000 asylum seekers. Salvini’s League scored its best election result in March elections after pledging to deport an estimated 500,000 unregistered migrants. In Germany, the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, pulled out of an integration summit hosted by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, saying Berlin should cooperate with Vienna and Rome in combating illegal immigration. Seehofer, of the Bavarian conservative CSU party, met Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. He declared his support for Kurz’s proposal for a three-way “axis of the willing” with Italy to fight illegal migration. Kurz, who leads a coalition government with the far-right Freedom party, said a growing number of European governments were now agreed on the need to curb uncontrolled migration and crack down on people trafficking. Seehofer told reporters he had spoken to Salvini, who also supported the proposed alliance. “Rome, Vienna and Berlin should work together at the interior minister level in the areas of security, fighting terrorism – and the core issue of immigration,” he said. “I accepted that … and we will push ahead with it.” Seehofer has put himself on a collision course with Merkel, his coalition ally, by pushing a tougher line on immigration, including a proposal as part of a new draft national “migrant masterplan” that Germany should turn away at the border migrants registered in other EU states. Merkel, who is working to pull together a Europe-wide deal on redistributing asylum seekers and find a more lasting solution to illegal migration involving enhanced controls along the European Union’s external border, has dismissed the plan as in breach of EU law. It would also represent a complete reversal of the open-doors migrant policy she adopted in 2015, which saw more than 1 million migrants enter Germany and which is seen as having fuelled a sharp rise in support for the rightwing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and caused deep rifts within her conservative bloc. With xenophobia on the rise across the continent, and hard-right parties either in government or riding high in the polls in countries from Italy in the south to Sweden on the north, immigration has become an issue of existential importance for the bloc. But member states remain deeply divided over burden-sharing plans aimed at warding off any repeat of the 2015-16 migration crisis, with “frontline” states like Italy, Greece and Spain complaining they are shouldering an unfair share of arrivals, wealthier destination countries such as Germany and the Netherlands arguing they have done enough, and hardline central European governments including Hungary and Poland flatly rejecting all compulsory refugee distribution schemes. Salvini, who said last week he would not allow Italy to become Europe’s “refugee camp”, told the Italian senate he was open to a possible “axis” with Germany and Austria, ahead of a key EU summit at the end of June that will consider possible changes to asylum law to better share the burden. “With my German and Austrian colleagues … we will propose a new [immigration] initiative,” Salvini said, adding that it would apply both to the EU’s external borders and to how member states manage migrants internally. But he demanded an apology from France, challenging Paris to take in the migrants it had promised to accept under an EU agreement and accusing it of turning back 10,000 at Italy’s northern border. He said France had committed to accepting 9,816 migrants under a 2015 EU redistribution scheme to relieve pressure on frontline countries, but in three years had accepted only 640 people. “So I ask President Macron to pass from words to action and tomorrow morning welcome the 9,816 France promised to welcome as a sign of concrete generosity and not just words,” he said. Conte called France’s approach to the migrant crisis hypocritical. Macron later appealed for the two sides not to “give in to emotions that certain people are manipulating”, insisting that France was “working hand in hand with Italy” to handle migration. A French foreign ministry spokeswoman said Paris was “fully aware of the burden migration pressure is placing on Italy”. Filippo Grandi, the head of the United Nations refugee agency, said the bitter dispute over which European country should take in the Aquarius vessel was “profoundly shameful”, but said more such incidents could be expected in the coming weeks as long as the bloc remained divided on its policies toward migrants and refugees. Aloys Vimard, the Médecins Sans Frontières project coordinator onboard the rescue ship, said there was an urgent need for “politicians to discuss this, and for the EU to find a dignified solution for these vulnerable people. We are very, very concerned because political considerations are being prioritised over the safety of vulnerable people.”"
2018-06-28T17:10:06Z,We need a paradigm shift in the way we think about migration | Letters,"Like climate change, migration is a global issue that needs to be addressed both locally and internationally. The regulation of population movements has long been a pitfall of international cooperation. The European asylum crisis of 2015 revealed that, even in highly integrated and cooperative contexts such as the EU, unpreparedness, political confusion and misinformation generate inadequate and humanly costly policy responses. At the global level, from the 1990 convention on migrant workers’ rights to the currently discussed “global compacts”, attempts to coordinate policies and foster global governance fell short of providing innovative and impactful solutions. The recent inflow of Syrian asylum seekers in Europe forced upon EU leaders and citizens a brutal awareness regarding the global refugee crisis that is mostly unfolding in the global south. This particular refugee inflow resonates with broader discussions on immigration, integration and diversity in European societies fragilised by the 2008 economic crisis. The current European crisis is made of the confusion of short- and long-term policy issues, of asylum and migration regulation, of debates around rights, politics and economics, which cannot be solely addressed at the national level. Beyond Europe, the emergence or entrenchment of political crises around migration and asylum issues calls for an urgent reaction of all stakeholders. Scientists, civil society organisations, activists, concerned citizens and policymakers must join forces to bring about a better understanding of migration, both forced and voluntary, of its determinants and consequences for host societies and countries of origin. By doing so, we will provide grounds for evidence-based policymaking and sound practices beyond ideological constructions and discourses that obfuscate debates in the media and political arena today. This call for a change of approach has become urgent. • Migration and asylum policies in Europe and North America as well as other countries (Kenya, Saudi Arabia etc) have created unprecedented attacks on individual human rights for mobile populations and on asylum rights. • Since the 1990s, attempts by the UN or regional organisations such as the EU to regulate migration and asylum have failed (The 1990 convention, the Dublin agreements in Europe, up to the global compacts) and collapsed when confronted by the trial of either refugee arrivals (Iraq, Syria, South Sudan, Burma) or political crises around migrants’ incorporation and diversity. The policy options adopted by OECD countries in the past decade – building walls, externalising control at high political and financial costs – will neither prevent people leaving their country, nor will it impact the determinants of migration in the long run as often repeated by scientists and shown by recent experiences. The lack of understanding of the impact of migration in host and receiving societies generates enduring mismanagement. Fearmongering discourses infuse policy agendas and ignores scientific knowledge. Although scientific controversies on migration and asylum do exist, some well-established facts remain unheard and unused in policymaking: • Migration mostly occurs within regions and not between continents. Migrants are mostly located in the global south, especially refugees. • 246 million migrants only represent 3.4% of the world’s population, far less than in the 19th century. • Visa restrictions increase the settlement of immigrants already present in a host country: migrant workers stay instead of moving back and forth across countries. The absence of visa opportunities for asylum seekers in countries of origin and transit also increases criminal practices and smuggling. • Border closure not only restricts mobility but also exchanges and transfers of funds, knowhowand ideas across borders. • Rapid access to housing, education as well as the formal labour market increases the quality of incorporation of migrants and asylum seekers in host societies, further reducing inequalities and disenfranchisement. • The impact of migration on population trends is short-lived as fertility behaviours rapidly catch up with demographic patterns in host countries. • Financing development can increase emigration in poor countries, making the migration-development relations much more complex than what current policies present as grounds for action. The effect of immigrant inflows on labour market outcomes and national growth is neutral or positive overall, depending upon economic conditions and dynamics, upon workers’ mobility and labour market regulations. In understanding the impact of immigration, analyses that are both context-specific and connected to global dynamics are crucial to determine the effects of migration. Recent concern has been formulated about the lack or unreliable quality of migration data. Beyond data, we argue that robustness and clarity in the analytical premises of policymaking is the key to sound and efficient regulation of population movement. One-size-fits-all and ideology-based policies do not work. We therefore urge the ending of the short-term and inadequate political solutions that brought us to political and humanitarian crises. We ask for a radical change of paradigm in dealing with migration and asylum, based on a rational, realistic, scientifically informed and humanist approach. We thus call for an emergency meeting of scientists and experts to inform policymaking, and for the creation of an International Panel on Migration and Asylum.

2018-12-25T06:30:16Z,The volunteers welcoming refugees on Canada's 'new underground railroad',"It was once a vital corridor for Americans seeking to escape slavery. Now a stretch of land in the north-eastern US is in the spotlight again, as thousands traipse across the world’s longest undefended border in search of asylum in Canada. “You can call it the new underground railroad, I think,” said Martha Swan of John Brown Lives, a humanitarian group named after the 19th-century abolitionist based in Westport, New York. “An informal network of people trying to help people who are under siege and who are trying to get to safety.” Since the start of 2017, more than 30,000 people – many of them driven by fears of Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants – have entered Canada at unmarked locations along the border. By doing so, they hope to skirt a longstanding pact that bars most refugee claimants in the US from applying for asylum in Canada. What started as a cross-Canada phenomenon, with migrants braving freezing temperatures, fields of waist-deep snow and icy ditches at times to enter the country, has narrowed to a few key spots along the border. The bulk of those crossing into Canada by foot now do so at Roxham Road in Quebec, where thousands entered last year in hopes of finding a safe haven in Canada. The crossing has become a flashpoint in Canada, attracting anti-immigrant protesters as well as counter-protesters who hold up messages of welcome aimed at those entering. And in an echo of the region’s rich history, the crossing – once also vital to those looking to avoid fighting in Vietnam or escape wars in Central America – has also become a focal point for a loose coalition of activists, organisations and faith groups on both sides of the border. Swan is quick to qualify her parallel with the underground railroad. “The difference is – and it’s an important difference – thus far, it’s not breaking any laws to provide some information and to hand out winter gloves and to help people on this crossing.” Still, the actions of those supporting the asylum seekers have at times landed them in crosshairs. After Canadian media reported on a pamphlet designed for migrants and which detailed the cost of taxis to the border and offered legal and emergency contacts, the group behind the flyer – a volunteer coalition of hundreds known as Plattsburgh Cares – saw a torrent of hateful comments flood their Facebook page. The comments were “just vulgar, really hurtful”, said Janet McFetridge of the group. “We weren’t telling people how to come, we were telling them how to be safe.” McFetridge, who lives next to the US side of the crossing, began visiting the crossing last year, handing out anything from winter hats to snacks. “It was like a brief moment of kindness. It had to do with people that I felt were in need and that maybe I could offer a little bit of assistance,” she said. “It had nothing to do with politics, it didn’t even really have anything to do with immigration.” Her actions, however, had unwittingly tapped into Canada’s simmering debate over the issue. Long buffered from irregular migration by its three coasts and the United States, a small number of Canada’s politicians have seized on the soaring number of asylum seekers, stoking fears about those crossing the border. Ontario’s Conservative government, led by Doug Ford, has withdrawn its support for the resettlement of asylum seekers who enter Canada irregularly, while this fall’s election in Quebec saw the leader of the province’s nationalist party muse about constructing a wall along the US border. McFetridge’s social media account became a target for angry Canadians – including a threat that she turned over to the New York state police. “I hope that doesn’t represent most Canadians – I have a lot of admiration for Canada,” she said. Many bristled at the idea that Americans would be providing any sort of support to those crossing into Canada irregularly. “It’s been hard to convince people that they’re not really coming to Roxham Road to get a hat from me. They’re really coming to go to Canada – it really has nothing to do with me,” said McFetridge. “With or without me, they’re still going to come.” Her organisation works closely with Bridges not Borders, a coalition of Canadian volunteers who live along the border. “People in need are coming to our border and are making a great deal of effort to get here,” said Wendy Ayotte of the group. “And we want to see them having a fair chance to go through the asylum process and contribute to our country as so many other refugees have contributed in the past.” Every Sunday, members of the group travel across the US border to Roxham Road. “And we’re just a welcoming presence, we don’t encourage or tell people what do to.” Part of Ayotte’s motivation is a deep conviction that Canada, home to some 36 million people, can do more. “There are so many people in distress and refugees in distress in the world, Canada takes in relatively so few. We’re such a wealthy nation – there were 50,600 people who came last year in total – that’s really a drop in the bucket. We’re well able to cope with that number of people.” Her organisation has long lobbied the Canadian government to scrap the Safe Third Country Agreement, the pact with the US that forces Canada to turn away most asylum seekers who attempt to enter the country at official border crossings. Doing so would allow asylum seekers to make claims at official ports of entry and ensure people aren’t returned to a country where their lives or liberty are at risk, she said. “People wouldn’t be risking their lives in the winter to come into Canada, the RCMP wouldn’t be deployed, their resources wouldn’t be used in this way,” Ayotte added. “And the optic that the far right is using – using this as a way of stirring up a very false sense of Canada being invaded and our borders are threatened, which is not the case – they would no longer be able to use this argument.” For some like Swan, the desolate dirt road and shallow ditch – now the busiest unofficial crossing between Canada and the US – has become a broader symbol amid a political climate marked by a rising anti-immigrant sentiment. “We have a choice to make as individuals, as an organisation … We have to ask ourselves, what kind of a people are we?” Swan asked. “Our abolitionist forebears, they had to ask themselves the same question,” she added. “What is going to be our response?”"
2018-11-27T05:00:08Z,Immigrants in Greece face winter crisis after public sector cuts,"Greece’s asylum system is hamstrung by public sector cuts imposed during the country’s EU bailouts, a UN envoy has said, as campaigners warned of a looming winter crisis for refugees and migrants. MEPs blame Europe’s asylum system for humanitarian conditions in Greece, where thousands are stranded in squalid camps that are a danger to physical and mental health. Philippe Leclerc, the UN refugee agency’s representative in Athens, said EU policy on Greece during the debt crisis was “totally legitimate”, but pointed to unintended consequences for migration. “It is a state that is affected by the consequences of the financial crisis and public control spending measures … [so] you have an emergency situation on the islands and the mainland, where the state is not fully equipped to respond.” He was speaking to the Guardian days after the UNHCR called on Greece to take “urgent steps” to improve conditions for 11,000 people in dirty and unsafe camps on the islands of Samos and Lesbos. Senior European sources are appalled by the camps, especially Samos, where 4,000 people are living in wretched conditions at the Vathy reception centre, six times above capacity. New arrivals are pitching flimsy tents on steep slopes around the camps and have no access to electricity, running water or lavatories. Inside the camps, broken toilets and showers mean that people live next to raw sewage. Camp dwellers also have to contend with snakes, and rats feeding on uncollected waste. “This is supposed to be the richest and most civilised continent in the world,” said the Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld. “This is happening under our noses.” EU officials think that Greek ministries are unable to coordinate or spend EU funds to help asylum seekers: the EU has allocated €1.6bn (about £1.4bn) since 2015, but at least €554m has not been spent by Greek authorities. Brussels is suspicious that the defence ministry, which is led by Panos Kammenos of the nationalist right party Independent Greeks, is not prioritising the humanitarian needs of refugees. The ministry, one of the key government departments overseeing refugee camps, has been at the centre of alleged misspending EU funds, claims that it has rejected as “fake news”. The EU’s anti-fraud agency, Olaf, confirmed that it has “opened an investigation into alleged irregularities concerning the provisions of EU funded food for refugees”, but declined to comment further. The EU is increasingly worried about a rise in arrivals in Greece, which is piling pressure on a system beset by delays. Greece is sheltering 67,100 refugees and migrants and has seen an abrupt surge in numbers crossing the land border with Turkey. The number of detections of illegal crossings at the northern land border has tripled, said Krzysztof Borowski, at the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). “This is adding to pressure on Greece.” Most making the treacherous journey across the fast-flowing Evros River separating the two nations are Turks fleeing political persecution. By October, registrations of Turkish nationals had jumped from 6,500 last year to 18,700, according to Frontex. Increasingly, Syrians and Iraqis have also joined the flows as word has spread that the land frontier is easier to cross. As winter approaches, NGOs are warning of a crisis in the making. “There are around 400 people in the north still living in tents,” said Ruben Cano who heads the Athens branch of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “The reception system in Greece is overwhelmed partly because the country is being made to shoulder too great a burden.” The influx has put increasing strain on an asylum service labouring under severe fiscal constraint. “People are working under adverse conditions. There is clearly an issue of staff capacity that we need to resolve,” said Markos Karavias, director of the Greek asylum service. Deep public sector cuts have contributed to Greece’s notoriously slow asylum procedures. Greece does not have enough judges to hear appeals, nor doctors and psychologists to carry out assessments of vulnerable claimants. One consequence is that few asylum seekers and migrants are being returned to Turkey, a possibility created by a controversial EU deal with Ankara in 2016. Brussels thinks that people-smugglers, aware of administrative shortcomings, are stepping up efforts to get people to Greece. “By not returning [from the islands to Turkey] you create a powerful marketing model [for smugglers],” said an EU source. MEPs say it is wrong to blame Greece. The Dutch MEP in ‘t Veld blamed “the dysfunction of the council” – EU leaders and home affairs ministers – for the asylum system’s inadequacies. EU member states remain deadlocked over a permanent system of refugee quotas, a dispute that threatens to delay a broader overhaul of the European asylum system, comprising seven laws. Péter Niedermüller, a Hungarian centre-left MEP, thinks it unlikely that the legislation will be agreed before European elections in 2019. “The whole refugee issue has been captured by the far-right political movements in Europe,” said Niedermüller, who led a European parliament delegation to Greece last year. “Italy, Austria, Poland and Hungary have nationalist anti-immigrant parties in government,” he added. “Many of the member states are not really ready to join a common European asylum policy and I think this is the problem.”"
2018-06-29T18:05:48Z,"EU's migrant centres could breach human rights, say campaigners","Secure migrant processing camps that may be set up in Europe under a deal reached by EU leaders risk becoming de facto detention centres breaching basic human rights, campaigners have said. The summit’s vaguely-worded conclusions after marathon talks in Brussels gave no details of what the “controlled centres” would look like or which states might volunteer to host them, but diplomats said they could resemble “improved versions” of existing – and heavily criticised – EU “hotspots” set up in Greece and Italy. “Rapid and secure processing” at the proposed EU-funded centres would allow economic migrants to be identified and returned home, the statement said, while those identified as “in need of international protection” would be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them “on the principle of solidarity”. Arrivals across the Mediterranean have fallen by more than 90% compared with 2015, but a political crisis has erupted across the bloc, with deep divisions emerging among member states about how to handle the problem. Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights programme director for Amnesty International, said the latest plan looked like “more of the same”. The proposals made the prospect of “lengthy and indefinite detention” look more likely, he said, in potential breach of EU and international law and the convention on human rights. Catherine Woollard, the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said her organisation’s prime concern was that the centres could become permanent detention hubs, particularly for migrants whose asylum claims have been rejected but cannot be returned. “We would also be concerned about them possibly becoming magnets for smuggling and trafficking groups,” she said, adding that some potential host countries the EU might approach, such as Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia or Serbia, had “serious problems” with organised crime. Further issues, including ensuring refugees’ rights to legal assistance and appeal, could arise if the EU gets into the business of processing asylum claims under EU asylum law in countries outside the EU or trying to join. The European commission introduced its controversial hotspots – intended as hubs where arrivals in so-called frontline states would be fingerprinted, identified, registered and moved on – as part of an effort to streamline the reception of asylum seekers at the height of the 2015 migration crisis. Ten centres, five in Italy and five in Greece, were opened, but EU member states failed to accept even a small fraction of the refugees they had pledged to take, so the centres rapidly turned into squalid, overcrowded camps. According to an official EU audit last year, migrants’ lives were plagued by a shocking lack of basic security, water, decent food, blankets and medical facilities. Sexual abuse and exploitation of the large numbers of unaccompanied minors in the camps was widespread, adding to concern about fundamental human rights violations including the deprivation of liberty. “In Greece, people have been held for a very long time, in terrible conditions, basically trapped and with no progress at all to resolve their asylum claim … or establish who is responsible for them,” Valdez-Symonds said. The Danish Refugee Council last year found evidence of a broad range of rights violations, including de facto detention. Humanitarian standards were branded appalling in some hotspots: the Moria camp in Lesbos, built to house 1,800 people, was holding 6,250 migrants and asylum seekers at one point, but only had one functioning latrine. Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, said on Friday after a five-day visit to Greece that the country must process asylum claims significantly faster and relocate asylum seekers from its islands, where many continue to live in cramped and dangerous conditions."
2018-10-11T05:34:12Z,Thursday briefing: Migrants languish in costly detention,"Top story: ‘Scandalously inhumane and unjustifiable’ Good morning. It’s Warren Murray with the essential news of the morning. A snapshot by the Guardian of 200 migrants held in seven British detention centres found more than half were suicidal, seriously ill or victims of torture, with 84% not told when they would be deported. Almost half the detainees had not committed a crime but had been detained for an average of four months. The situation appears to contravene UN human rights guidance that immigration detention should be a last resort. The government detains just over 25,000 people every year pending deportation, at an annual cost of £108m. But fewer than 50% of those held in removal centres actually end up being deported, and most have lived in the UK for five years or more. A handful of private firms are paid hundreds of millions of dollars to run the detention centres, raking in up to 30% profit. The UK is the only European country without a limit on how long these people can be detained. The Labour shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “This is a scandalously inhumane and unjustifiable system.” James Price from the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: “A bureaucratic and lengthy wait [for deportation] is bad for the welfare of those detained, as well as costing taxpayers and meaning less money for essential services.” A Home Office spokesman said the home secretary, Sajid Javid, wanted to “go further and faster” in finding alternatives to detention. Our investigation compiled data from 11 law firms and charities that work with those facing deportation. It should be treated as a snapshot and not a sample representative of the whole population in immigration detention. We will be publishing more of our findings here this morning. * * * Hurricane Michael’s havoc – The strongest storm to ever hit the Florida Panhandle has caused widespread damage. In Florida a man was killed by a falling tree, and a child died in Seminole County, Georgia, when a house was damaged. More than 311,000 homes and businesses in Florida, Georgia and Alabama were left without power. Donald Trump described the storm as a “monster” and acknowledged that poverty in some areas had held back evacuation efforts. “A lot of people are very poor … And it’s very tough for them to leave,” he said. The hurricane was downgraded to a category 2 storm last night, with Georgia and the Carolinas next in its path. In addition to the morning briefing, we now have a US briefing to bring you a view of the news from stateside. Here’s how to get it. * * * House price downturn – “A disaster for the property market,” says one property surveyor, about Brexit uncertainty, though people trying to find a home they can afford may feel differently. Prices are continuing to fall in a depressed property market and that trend has spread beyond London, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Outside the south, Brexit uncertainty is having less of an impact. “House prices continue to rise firmly across much of the UK, with the West Midlands, Northern Ireland and Scotland posting the strongest growth,” says Rics. * * * Guardian digital pack – get a free trial Subscribing to the Guardian means investing in our journalism.

The sticking point with the Northern Ireland unionists is the “backstop” provision to keep the Irish border open come what may. The hard-Brexiter, Chequers-hating Tory faction ERG is also threatening to vote against the budget, which would be a crisis for May’s authority. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has claimed a deal could be within reach by a crunch meeting next Wednesday but warned the PM that impediments on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of UK could be avoided only if she abandoned a key red line and agreed to a customs union. * * * Perils of wet wood – People burning wet wood on inefficient stoves are poisoning themselves and their neighbours, the IPPR thinktank has warned. Its study highlights the “shocking contribution” of wood and coal fires to UK air pollution, which causes 40,000 early deaths a year and health problems for many others. Burning wood, coal or other solid fuels in the home is the largest single contributor to production of the most dangerous pollutant, known as particulate matter: tiny particles that penetrate deep into the body. The IPPR calls for the sale of wet wood and smoky coal to be banned no later than 2020, and for near-zero domestic emissions by 2050 of the worst particulate emissions, known as PM2.5. * * * A fandango into literature – Anthony “the Mooch” Scaramucci is back with bouquets for Donald Trump and brickbats for Steve Bannon. The man who lasted only 10 days as White House communications director is publishing a memoir entitled Trump, the Blue-Collar President wherein he trashes Bannon as a hypocrite and a weirdo, while hailing Trump as having “an intellect that is uniquely suited to the presidency”. The Briefing will let the Mooch explain that one: “He never let anyone know he was gathering information to make policy out of it … So he made it seem like he was chatting, talking economics and trade policy the way you’d talk about the New York Mets. Then he synthesised all the responses into one position, letting in the good bits and keeping out the bad.” Lunchtime read: ‘Soft hair’ – Hawking’s final legacy Stephen Hawking’s final scientific paper has been released by physicists who worked with the late cosmologist on his career-long effort to understand what happens to information when objects fall into black holes. The work tackles “the information paradox”: the rules of the quantum world demand that information is never lost, even when something falls into a black hole. But when an exhausted black hole evaporates out of existence, what happens to all that information? Researchers who collaborated with Hawking now believe that, at least in part, it goes into “soft hair” – a haze of photons at the event horizon, a black hole’s point of no return. Malcolm Perry, Cambridge professor and co-author of the paper, Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair, said the information paradox was “at the centre of Hawking’s life” for more than 40 years. The paper was completed in the days before Hawking’s death in March.

2018-08-28T18:19:30Z,Matteo Salvini and Viktor Orbán to form anti-migration front,"The Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, have said they are “walking down the same path” after discussing the formation of a common anti-migration front they said would oppose the policies of the French president. “We want to change Europe’s commission. We want to protect our borders. We are going to fight pro-migrant policies supported by [Emmanuel] Macron and [George] Soros,” Salvini said after the pair met in Milan. The talks between two of Europe’s most vocal hardline leaders followed a standoff with Brussels after Salvini prevented 177 asylum seekers disembarking from the coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti for almost a week as he called for guarantees that other EU member states would take most of them. After his request was refused, Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League, announced he would meet Orbán to discuss “alternative strategies”. “European elections are coming. We have to change a lot of things,” Orbán said on Tuesday. “There are two sides at the moment in Europe. One is led by Macron, who is supporting migration. The other one is supported by countries who want to protect their borders. Hungary and Italy belong to the latter.” It is not the first time Salvini has attacked the French president, who in turn has shown no sympathy for the Italian interior minister. Macron said in June that extremists in “neighbour” countries were betraying European values. Orbán, whom Salvini has described as a political role model, has been among the most hostile to immigration in Europe and appears to be a natural ally for Salvini. His Fidesz party was re-elected in April, promising to crack down on aid groups it said supported migrants. “Hungary has shown that we can stop migrants on land. Salvini has shown migrants can be stopped at sea. We thank him for protecting Europe’s borders,” Orbán said. “We must send migrants back to their countries. Brussels says we cannot do it. They also had said it was impossible to stop migrants on land, but we did it.” Despite sharing the same anti-migration platform, the two leaders appear to disagree on the relocation of asylum seekers. Salvini is pushing for their distribution among EU nations, whereas Orbán stands with Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in saying no. Orbán brushed off their differences before the meeting. “Me and Salvini, we seem to share the same destiny. He is my hero,” he told reporters. He again described Salvini as a “hero” after their talks, saying he “could win the elections in Hungary if he would decide to run”. Thousands of leftwing activists had gathered in Milan to protest against the two men. During the standoff over the Diciotti the Italian government threatened to suspend its EU budget contributions. Those stuck onboard were allowed to disembark on Saturday, with Ireland, Albania and Italy’s Catholic Church agreeing to take most of them. The European commission said threats were unhelpful and called on all countries to find a solution to help the people onboard. “The consequences of the Diciotti case and the way Italy is dealing with migration in general risks destabilising the equilibrium of a Europe that is still glued to its national interests,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “Italy has become a laboratory of European populism and risks moving away not only from Europe, but also from western democracies and getting closer, together with Orbán’s Hungary, to [Russia’s Vladimir] Putin, who enjoys Salvini’s manifestations of sympathy.” The meeting followed talks between the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and his Czech counterpart, Andrej Babiš, who has opposed relocating refugees and migrants. Conte would visit Moscow in October, Russian news agencies said on Tuesday. Salvini was placed under investigation last week by Italian prosecutors from Agrigento, Sicily, for potential abuse of office, kidnapping and illegal detention, relating to his refusal to allow those onboard the Diciotti to disembark. Their release will not stop the investigation into Salvini, who governs in coalition with the populist and anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after an election campaign this year in which he vowed to adopt tough polices on immigration. Salvini has repeatedly said Italy will “no longer be Europe’s refugee camp”, and as first evidence of the new government’s hardline approach closed all Italian seaports to rescue boats operated by non-government organisations in the Mediterranean."
2018-09-24T16:20:07Z,Italian government approves Salvini bill targeting migrants,"A series of hardline measures that will see the Italian government abolish key forms of protection for migrants and make it easier for them to be deported has been approved by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s cabinet. Drafted by Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister and leader of the League, the decree will also suspend the refugee application process of those who are considered “socially dangerous” or who have been convicted of a crime. Salvini, who has blocked NGO rescue ships from Italian ports to cut the number of migrants arriving in the country by sea, said the bill was a “step forward to making Italy safer”. He claimed it would also strengthen the fight against the mafia and people traffickers, give the police greater powers and “expel offenders and fake refugees”. Parliament has 60 days to debate and modify the decree before it becomes law. The plans include abolishing humanitarian protection, a form of protection for those not eligible for refugee status but who for various reason cannot be sent home, and replacing it with a special permits system that will limit eligibility to people such as victims of a natural disaster or those with a serious illness. Salvini pledged last week to stop giving permits to “crafty migrants not escaping war”. Christopher Hein, a professor of law and immigration policies at Luiss University in Rome, said the measures could have a dramatic impact on the lives of tens of thousands already in the country. The majority of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years have been granted humanitarian protection status, which is valid for two years and entitles them to a residency permit and enables them to work. “Far more people are on this permit than the number of recognised refugees – last year it was around 25% of all asylum seekers,” said Hein. Salvini’s move may, however, also lead to an increase in the number of irregular migrants. “If people do not have a chance to obtain this kind of protection, or they no longer make an attempt, or they get rejected, it does not mean that the next day they simply go home,” said Hein. “The ultimate aim is to have no refugees at all in Italy through a combination of efforts: closure of seaports, criminalising migrant rescue NGOs, enhancing collaboration with the coastguard and now, with this decree, they target those who are already here, or who may come in future and not get any kind of protection – it is a deterrent measure.” The plan to suspend the asylum requests of those considered “socially dangerous” could result in people being expelled on the basis of accusations of deviance rather than convictions. The decree did not include measures against the Roma community, although Salvini said he was in talks with the mayors of major cities to ensure that all camps were closed."
2018-07-24T10:51:22Z,Italy dismisses plan to pay EU countries to host migrants as 'charity handout',"Italy’s far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini dismissed the European Union’s latest migration plan as a “charity handout”, after Brussels proposed €6,000 (£5,346) payments to member states for every migrant hosted at a secure centre on their soil. The European commission said member states would be entitled to the payment for every migrant rescued in the Mediterranean and taken to a “controlled centre” in an EU member state to process their asylum claims. Brussels hopes the payments will ease the pressure on Italy, by encouraging other states to take in migrants. But Salvini said it was not enough. “We aren’t asking for charity handouts. Every asylum seeker costs the Italian taxpayer between €40,000 and €50,000. Brussels, they can keep their charity for themselves,” he said. “We don’t want money. We want dignity.” Although numbers taking the life-threatening voyage across the Mediterranean have fallen sharply, the issue has become a political crisis, after Salvin refused to allow boats carrying migrants to dock at Italian ports. Softening this line on Monday, the Italian government said it would allow boats to dock for five weeks while the EU works out a new asylum policy. EU leaders – including Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte – agreed to create secure centres for processing asylum claims of Mediterranean migrants at an all-night summit last month. But the plans were immediately thrown into doubt when Austria, France, Germany and Italy indicated they had no intention of hosting such centres. Although no country has offered to set up a “controlled centre”, on Tuesday the EU’s executive arm attempted to flesh out the details while pledging “full operational support” – teams of EU border guards, asylum officers, translators and officials to return failed asylum seekers to their country of origin. For a boatload of 500 people, the commission estimates providing 150 staff from the European Border and Coastguard Agency plus 145 from the European Asylum Support Office, two agencies set to grow in power as part of the EU response to migration. The EU police agency, Europol, would provide up to 20 officers per boat to carry out security checks. Member states would be expected to provide doctors, nurses and other medical staff. All costs would be covered by the EU budget, including the €6,000 payment per person. The proposals are the latest attempt by the commission to spread the cost of migration, which falls heavily on Mediterranean states and countries that have taken in large numbers of refugees. Hanne Beirens, an associate director at the Migration Policy Institute, argued that one weakness of the plan was its voluntary basis, as no country is compelled to act. “The question of solidarity is a big question mark and it is not clear how this will be resolved.” The commission hopes to convince member states, partly, by stressing the temporary nature of the centres. Claims would be processed in four to eight weeks, much faster than usual. German authorities, for example, require nearly eight months per claim. “If you want to sell a concept to member states, you don’t want to propose a warehouse; that’s a big concern,” Beirens said. But she said it remained to be seen whether the process could be sped up, especially when officials will be dealing with people from several different countries, possibly without documents. The commission also restated the EU’s intention to set up migrant processing centres in non-EU countries to assess asylum claims of people rescued at sea. That plan is also in question, after Tunisia and then Libya flatly refused to get involved. The EU said it was ready to provide “financial and logistical support” to host countries without spelling out details. Senior commission officials said they never intended setting up such centres in Libya, where thousands of people are being held in detention camps in appalling conditions. Instead, the commission hopes to work with Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, although hopes of getting these countries to sign up are low. Anxious to avoid making it easier for migrants to reach Europe, the commission proposes setting up the centres “as far away as possible” from disembarkation points to avoid a “pull factor”. The EU hopes to set up the centres with the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration. Both agencies insist the centres cannot be closed detention camps if they are involved. The numbers of people making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean has sharply fallen since record numbers arrived in Europe in 2015-16. So far this year, 17,838 people have crossed the central Mediterranean Sea to Italy, compared with 119,369 who arrived in 2017 and 181,436 the year before, according to the IOM. But migration remains a big electoral issue: it has been blamed for bringing Italy’s far-right League party into a coalition government, while the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had to hold crisis talks to preserve her coalition with Bavaria’s centre-right party. The latest ideas will be discussed by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, but it remains unclear whether member states will back the commission’s vision. • The picture caption was amended on 25 July 2018 to give the year that it was taken, 2016.

2018-12-05T19:08:54Z,Syrian aid worker who swam refugees to safety freed from Greek jail,"After 107 days of incarceration, Sarah Mardini – the Syrian human rights worker who saved 18 refugees in 2015 by swimming their waterlogged dinghy to the shores of Lesbos with her Olympian sister – has been freed from Greece’s toughest jail. The 23-year-old was released late on Wednesday from the high-security Koryallos prison in Athens, where she was being held in pre-trial detention on charges of people-smuggling. She was allowed to walk free after her lawyers posted €5,000 (£4,450) in bail. Sean Binder, a 24-year-old volunteer born in Germany and resident in Ireland, was also freed from custody in Chios along with two others from the NGO for which both had worked. “We are all incredibly happy, incredibly relieved,” said Dr Florian Becker, the managing director of Bard College in Berlin, where Mardini had been enrolled before her arrest in Lesbos in August. “But sadly this is not the end. While copious evidence has been produced to prove their innocence we still don’t know if the charges will be dropped against them.” Greece was strongly criticised by human rights groups following the aid workers’ arrests. Amnesty International and other organisations insisted the case embodied efforts to criminalise humanitarian work in a climate that has become increasingly hostile towards migrants and refugees across Europe. Mardini and Binder had faced prison sentences of up to 25 years after being accused of facilitating people-smuggling through membership of a criminal organisation. Charges of espionage and money laundering were also levelled at the activists. Both had been volunteering in search and rescue operations with the now-defunct Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI), an NGO based on Lesbos. In an unusually long statement following six months of inquiries, police said the activities amounted to “organised migrant trafficking rings” by people who had knowledge of “specific refugee flows”. Zaccharias Kesses, the lawyer heading the aid workers’ legal team in Athens, confirmed that Mardini would be free to return to Berlin, where her supporters have taken to the streets. Previously a judge had rejected appeals for the aid workers to be released, citing the risk of re-offending. “The release of all of them at the same time is proof that there is not enough evidence against them,” Kesses told the Guardian. “The arrests were clearly part of an organised plan to criminalise humanitarian aid and to a great degree it worked. Hundreds of volunteers have been discouraged and on Lesbos many have left. Their release today is a great success.” But Kesses said a trial was still likely to take place. “The charges may be amended but I think it very unlikely that the trial will be dropped. There is vast pressure in local society against NGOs, who are perceived to be pull factors for refugees at a time when few want them.” Although arrivals on Greek shores have abated since the peak of the migrant crisis at the height of Syria’s civil war, the influx has increased this year with growing numbers dying or being reported missing while attempting to reach Greece from Turkey in rickety boats crossing the Aegean Sea. Amnesty International’s Greece researcher Kondylia Gougou said: “Whilst we welcome the news that these dedicated humanitarians will be back with their families tonight after more than 100 days behind bars, the fact that they still face absurd charges and potentially long prison sentences is an outrage. To detain dedicated volunteer humanitarians who helped people in need defies logic … these baseless charges should be dropped.”"
2018-12-07T05:00:07Z,Vulnerable migrants made homeless after Italy passes 'Salvini decree',"Dozens of migrants, including victims of sex trafficking and a child with mental health problems, have been removed from so-called “welcome centres” in Italy as the populist government’s hardline immigration measures kick in. The “Salvini decree” – named after Matteo Salvini, interior minister and leader of the far-right League – won a vote in parliament last week and was formally endorsed by the president Sergio Mattarella on Monday. The main element of the bill, which abolishes humanitarian protection for those not eligible for refugee status but who cannot be sent home, was however retroactively applied by the interior ministry’s representative in Crotone, a province in the southern Calabria region, where last Friday 24 people were forced to leave a centre in the town of Isola Capo Rizzuto. The evictions are not only affecting those whose request for protection on humanitarian grounds is pending approval, but also those in possession of permits to stay, despite the law stipulating that their status should be maintained. The majority of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years have been granted humanitarian protection, with some 100,000 people estimated to hold the permit, which is valid for two years and enables them to work. Among those stranded in Isola Capo Rizzuto were a young couple with a five-month-old daughter, two victims of sex trafficking and a boy suffering from mental health problems. “When the police came to tell us that we couldn’t stay there anymore, I couldn’t believe my ears,” Blessing, a 31-year-old victim of sex trafficking from Nigeria, told the Guardian. “They took all of our belongings and escorted us out. There was a young girl in our group. This is outrageous. I have a legal permit to stay. And soon I may not have a roof over my head. I’m really frightened.” Blessing found temporary shelter in a Red Cross charity facility in Crotone while the rest have also been accommodated with the help of other charities and the town hall. “What happened here is crazy,” said Francesco Parisi, president of Crotone’s Red Cross. “You can’t just leave vulnerable people on the street. This is a violation of human rights. We are going to take care of these people now, but I hope things will change.” Alessia Romana, a social policies councillor in Crotone, said the local authority was trying to manage the situation. “The council has a moral obligation but also the juridical obligation to take care of these people,” she said. “Up until now, the system in Crotone worked well. We managed to give reception and there wasn’t any trouble; migrants and locals co-existed.” A similar measure was applied in Potenza, a city in the southern region of Basilicata, with the interior ministry prefect there announcing last week that “humanitarian protection holders” must be “invited to leave” welcome centres. Once humanitarian protection permits are received, people are supposed to leave centres on the first rung of the migrant reception system and move to an accommodation in which they can benefit from integration programmes. But slow-moving bureaucracy and limited space means that those with permits end up staying in the first-rung centres for longer. A dozen or so others have been asked to leave a welcome centre in Caserta, Campania, according to Italian press reports, while hundreds are expected to be evicted from Cara di Mineo, Europe’s second largest migrant reception centre, in the coming days. The number is likely to rise as the bill, which Salvini has described as a “gift to Italians”, takes effect. The loss of protection will also mean hundreds of people suddenly becoming “illegal” immigrants, with Italy’s national statistics office estimating that the decree will make 130,000 migrants illegal by 2020. “What we have been witnessing recently leads us to believe that there will be negative effects not only on vulnerable people, but also on Italian society generally as people enter into a formally illegal status,” said Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in southern Europe. “We fail to understand why, at this precise moment, even those individuals with legal protection have been told to leave. The decree is not retroactive, so why are they telling them to leave? Sending families away, women and children, pregnant women. It seems cruel.” Cities including Bologna, Turin and Rome, the latter two of which are managed by the Five Star Movement, the League’s coalition partner, have refused to implement the measures, arguing they will increase homelessness and risk social unrest. “We are really worried about a bill that is meant to manage immigration and increase security for citizens, but will instead create social marginality and destroy integration, while also creating social risks and the potential for radicalisation,” said Valeria Carlini, a spokesperson for the Italian Council for Refugees."
2018-07-25T03:20:31Z,Dutton says Australia won't 'surrender our sovereignty' by signing UN migration deal,"Australia will not sign a United Nations migration agreement it helped negotiate “in its current form”, Peter Dutton has declared, insisting it is a matter of sovereignty. Human rights activists have condemned the decision not to become a signatory of global guidelines for dealing with migration as an attempt to avoid further inspection of Australia’s policies. Confirming the contents of an article which appeared in the Australian earlier this week, the home affairs minister told Sydney radio 2GB that Australia would not sign the UN global compact for migration, which aims to address migration issues in a “safe, orderly and regular” way, if it stayed in its present incarnation. Australia has taken umbrage at parts of the final draft, which insist “migration detention” should only be used “as a measure of last resort and work towards alternatives”. The final draft also includes a commitment to “review and revise relevant legislation, policies and practices related to immigration detention to ensure that migrants are not detained arbitrarily, that decisions to detain are based on law, are proportionate, have a legitimate purpose, and are taken on an individual basis, in full compliance with due process and procedural safeguards, and that immigration detention is not promoted as a deterrent or used as a form of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment to migrants, in accordance with international human rights law”. Dutton told Alan Jones that while Australia was happy to negotiate “in good faith”, “we’re not going to sign any document that’s not in our national interest and it’s not in our national interest to sign our border protection policy over to the UN”. “We’re not going to sign a deal that sacrifices anything in terms of our border protection policies,” he said. “We’ve fought hard for them,” he said, adding Australia would not sign at all if it was deemed by the government to be “not in our national interests”. “We’re not going to surrender our sovereignty – I’m not going to allow unelected bodies dictate to us, to the Australian people.” The director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, Daniel Webb, criticised the decision as an attempt to avoid oversight. “Our government has detained 120 children in an island prison for five years. Twelve people have died. Children as young as 10 are trying to kill themselves,” he said. “It’s no wonder our government is trying to shirk scrutiny.” Amnesty International’s head of refugee and migrant rights, Charmain Mohamed, said a second, related global compact on refugees had been an ambitious endeavour that should have created wholesale change in the way refugees were treated by governments all over the world. “Sadly, world leaders were not up to the challenge of delivering the bold and brave solutions that are so urgently needed.” Mohamed said the final text entrenched the current approach where states felt they could pick and choose which measures to adopt and which to reject, and that the responsibility for caring for the world’s displaced population, currently at record levels, would remain largely with developing countries least equipped to support them. And governments were already defying the intent of the compact, Mohamed said. “As diplomats were negotiating the compact at the UN, European governments were attacking NGOs’ capacity to rescue refugees stranded at sea and hatching new plans to deter and detain refugees, while Australia continued to justify its cruel and torturous detention practices on Manus and Nauru. “What is needed more than ever is a human-rights based, compassionate response to refugees’ needs, based on global responsibility sharing not responsibility shirking.” The United States left negotiations on the global compact on migrants late last year, while last week, Hungary became the second UN member state to withdraw, with its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was elected on an anti-immigration platform, pulling his nation from the deal. Labor has stayed relatively quiet on the issue, with immigration becoming the latest flashpoint in the super Saturday byelection campaigns, an issue which will continue to dominate the political agenda, as the nation heads to a general election in less than a year. Earlier this month, Dutton contradicted Scott Morrison’s claim that lower immigration levels would cost the budget, after it was revealed just under 162,420 people had permanently migrated to Australia in the last financial year, a drop from the 183,608 people who followed the same path the year before. Morrison had warned that following Tony Abbott’s proposal to cut migration numbers by 80,000 people would cost the Australian economy between $4bn and $5bn over four years, but Dutton argued there was an economic argument to make for cutting migration numbers. “It’s [the impact of lower migration numbers] a positive one, because if we’re bringing more productive people in, then there’s more economic benefit for our country and there’s also greater societal benefit as well.” On Tuesday, Dutton’s office announced 600 people smugglers had been arrested since Operation Sovereign Borders was initiated under the Abbott government in 2013, with 33 boats turned back and 70 people-smuggling operations interrupted. Dutton released the information in an attempt to bolster his argument that Labor, under pressure from a push from its left factions, was seeking to dump the government’s policy and “restart the boats”. In response, Bill Shorten said “the people smugglers will not get back into business regardless of who is the government of Australia”, while accusing Dutton of attempting to provoke people-smuggling operations into action. “I think the government is trying to goad the people smugglers and goad the boats,” Shorten said. “You almost get a sense they miss them. That’s the only issue they can talk about in the byelections.”"
2018-12-29T14:36:23Z,The US government deliberately made the desert deadly for migrants | Natascha Elena Uhlmann,"This month, Jakelin Caal Maquin, a seven-year-old Guatemalan girl, died less than 48 hours after being detained at a remote New Mexico border crossing. Felipe Gómez Alonzo, an eight-year old Guatemalan boy, spent his final days in custody before tragically passing on Christmas Eve. Both were brought to the United States by families seeking a better life for their children. In the United States, all they found was death. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have been quick to deflect the blame. “[Jakelin’s] family chose to cross illegally,” Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen asserted. In the case of Felipe, the DHS pointed to migrant shelters in Mexico as possible sources of disease. These desperate attempts do little to obscure the full weight of US culpability. When trying to make sense of these two tragic deaths – and while details are still emerging – one thing is clear: the journey they undertook is designed to be deadly. In the 1990s, then president Bill Clinton introduced Prevention Through Deterrence, a border security policy which closed off established migrant routes. This forced migrants like Jakelin and her father through more remote and trying terrain. Jakelin and Felipe would probably not have died had it not been for the extreme conditions that Prevention Through Deterrence forces migrants to withstand. As the No More Deaths spokeswoman, Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, notes: “Crossing from the US border in any location, there’s no physical way as a human being to carry the kind of water you’ll need to survive those conditions for three, four days of walking.” Those who survive the immediate journey still face significant health risks if they are not immediately granted medical treatment – at present, border patrol relies on self-assessment, and, as in Jakelin’s case, the documentation is often in a language they can’t read. Prevention Through Deterrence meant tremendous investments in surveillance and border militarization, with the aim of pushing migrants ever deeper into the unforgiving Sonoran desert. Though the border patrol denies accountability for deaths along the US-Mexico border, their very metrics for success under the policy include “fee increases by smugglers”, “possible increase in complaints”, and “more violence at attempted entries”. These children’s deaths were by no means unpredictable. Violence is built into the plan. The immigrant advocacy group No More Deaths charges that the US border patrol uses the desert as a weapon. Armed with night-vision equipment, border patrol agents chase migrants blindly into hostile desert terrain. In the ensuing chaos, migrants fall to their deaths, or get hopelessly lost. Hundreds disappear each year, their remains too decomposed to be identified. Prevention Through Deterrence has done little to curb migration, but it has led to an explosion in needless suffering. As accessible routes are abandoned in favor of remote terrain, what was once a straightforward journey becomes life-threatening. In 1994, the year of the strategy’s inception, there were an estimated 14 deaths alongside the US-Mexico border. Last year, a staggering 412 deaths were documented in the region. As migrants are funnelled deeper into remote areas, they face not only the capricious desert terrain, but fatigue, dehydration and a host of heat-related ailments. Seizing on an influx of vulnerable, disoriented travellers, cartels lie in wait to extort and kidnap their next victims. Stories of rape along the migrant trail are so overwhelmingly common that many take contraceptives before the journey. Prevention Through Deterrence assumes that migrants will simply stop coming if the journey is difficult enough. But migration is as old as human history itself. While the US decries an explosion of immigrants, policymakers would do well to consider their role in perpetuating migration flows. From exploitative trade deals – Nafta put more than 1 million Mexican farmers out of work – to outright imperial aggression – see US-backed coups in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala and Honduras, among others – the US is a harbinger of death and destruction across the continent. To turn away those who flee the disastrous results of our policies is victim blaming of the most vile sort. US immigration officials have expressed regret at the passing of these children. Don’t take their word for it. Just last year, No More Deaths released video evidence of border patrol officials vandalizing water left for migrants. An unidentified agent grins at the camera while emptying water jugs, and others kick over bottles with glee. In the arid Sonoran desert, it is physically impossible to carry enough water to survive, a fact that is not lost on those who are employed to monitor the terrain day in and out. Within hours of the video’s release, a member of No More Deaths was arrested on charges of harboring immigrants. He will face 20 years in prison if convicted. A popular immigrant refrain asserts: “We are here because you were there.” US policies of economic extraction and militarism put children like Jakelin and Felipe at risk every single day. To put an end to deaths at the border, the US must stop penalizing those who flee its very own destruction. Natascha Elena Uhlmann is a writer and activist from Sonora, Mexico.

2018-10-04T14:09:40Z,Libya is a war zone. Why is the EU still sending refugees back there? | Sally Hayden,"“Some around the world are arguing that human rights are outdated, that national interest can justify the suppression of individual and collective rights,” declared Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, last week at the UN general assembly. “We are here today to state the opposite … Human rights are real.” As she said this, I was getting desperate WhatsApp messages from some of the thousands of refugees locked up indefinitely in detention centres in Tripoli, after being forced back to Libya under EU policy. The same day, hundreds in the Abu Salim detention centre had been threatened by unknown men with guns, while a pregnant woman collapsed from sickness amid heavy rain. Since 26 August, Tripoli has experienced the worst fighting in years, as rival militias fight to take control of the city. As the UN-backed government declared a state of emergency and shells began to fall indiscriminately, refugees and migrants were abandoned or released on to the dangerous streets. Some resorted to drinking toilet water to survive. Others were stuck on front lines, shot at or abducted by suspected traffickers, or cowered together as bombs went off beside them. Using a smartphone shared among hundreds of people, the first group contacted me to appeal for help after one man’s brother found my number online. Since then, around 20 more migrants and refugees have got in touch, describing periods of up to five days without food, sending pictures of men with anti-aircraft missiles driving around outside, or photos showing a newborn baby, whose mother gave birth inside an open hall as the conflict raged on. “The buildings around us are smoking,” one Eritrean man messaged me, as he pleaded for evacuation – something that Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has repeatedly called for. Europe’s “stop the boats” policy now resembles Australia’s, as African migrants and refugees are locked up indefinitely after being returned to Libya by the EU-backed Libyan coastguard. They have no recourse to judicial review, instead waiting for help from the UN, while praying not to be sold to traffickers by Libyan authorities who regularly threaten and insult them. There are roughly 7,000 people in “official” Tripoli detention centres, including 640 children, according to the UN. Many of those currently incarcerated described the moment they came closest to freedom: a point in the Mediterranean when they thought help had come, in the form of Italian boats, only for the boats to block their way until the Libyans arrived to pull them back. Provisional figures released by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies this week show that one in five migrants who tried to escape Libya by sea in September died or disappeared – the highest percentage recorded. Seven in 10 were caught and returned by the Libyan coastguard, while only one in 10 made it to Europe. One of the last operating private rescue ships, MSF’s Aquarius, has just lost its registration because of political pressure. While the EU has been effectively treating Libya as a safe country, despite consistent reports of rapes, torture, exploitation, forced labour and physical abuse of returnees, the fighting that broke out in August exposed how untrue this was. As refugees called me and begged for help, I contacted international organisations including the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration. Again and again, they said there was nothing they could do while the fighting continued. The refugees have been left on their own to fight for survival. Some have even been forced to become actors in the war, after militias pulled them out of detention centres and made them move heavy weapons or pack bullets, beating those who resisted. It also became increasingly clear that, in some cases, the messages sent out by the UN seemed to be sugarcoating the reality on the ground. While the UNHCR claimed to have “evacuated” refugees “out of harm’s way” in a statement on 30 August, the hundreds who were moved were abandoned in a battleground days later, and starved for even longer than before. While the UN said it had distributed blankets, the refugees said they still hadn’t arrived, and when they did they were stolen by their fleeing guards. In some centres, less than a quarter of the people from refugee-recognised countries say they have been registered with the UNHCR, despite the UN having a mandate to protect them. Some have waited as long as eight months. Last week, the UNHCR finally admitted that it had no access to the centres and had evacuated most of its own people. “We have less than a handful of international staff that are in the country currently,” Kelly Clements, deputy high commissioner at the UNHCR, told me in New York. A second ceasefire between Libyan militias was announced last Tuesday, though it remains to be seen if it will hold (a previous ceasefire, agreed on 4 September, lasted just a few days). For the thousands of detainees who have escaped dictatorships or war zones, only to survive torture and abuse by smugglers, the proclamations about human rights by European politicians are total hypocrisy. “We are losing hope, even from God,” one previously responsive refugee messaged me recently, after a long break in contact. “My mind is not working [like] before. Everything is becoming darkness.” • Sally Hayden is a journalist focusing on migration, conflict, human rights and humanitarian crises"
2018-06-28T16:36:37Z,"Future of EU hinges on solving migration issue, says Merkel","Angela Merkel warned on Thursday that the future of the European Union hinged on whether it could find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, as she received muted support from some of her fellow leaders arriving for a crucial summit likely to determine whether her fraying coalition government survives. Addressing the Bundestag before heading to Brussels, the German chancellor said European leaders should find a solution to asylum challenges “by allowing ourselves to be guided by values and rooting for multilateralism rather than unilateralism”. If the heads of government gathering in Brussels failed to do so, Merkel warned, they risked creating a situation where “no one believes in the value system that has made us so strong”. Migration is dominating the EU summit in Brussels, whose agenda has been dubbed by some insiders as Saving Private Merkel. Germany’s coalition government is under immense strain, after the hardline interior minister Horst Seehofer threatened to turn away any asylum claimants already registered in another EU country, unless Merkel came up with a solution by 1 July. Merkel fears that if Germany closes its borders it will set off a chain reaction that destroys Europe’s border-free travel zone, regarded by the EU as one of its greatest achievements, as well as a lynchpin of jobs and prosperity. The leaders of Spain, Finland and Luxembourg expressed support for Germany to curtail “secondary movement” of migrants who have made an asylum claim in another European country. “I understand when Germany says ‘why do we have to deal with everything?’” said Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel. The Spanish PM, Pedro Sánchez, said European solidarity on migration was vital, “especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis”. But Italy threatened to veto the summit agreement if it did not meet Rome’s demands for more help managing arrivals to its shores. European leaders are at odds over how to reform EU asylum policy, which is based on the principle that the first country of arrival takes responsibility for asylum claims. The system has put frontline states Italy, Greece and Spain under immense pressure, while Germany faces “secondary movements” of migrants, who may be seeking to speed up asylum claims. Greece said it was ready to help Germany by taking back asylum seekers, a political boost for Merkel, but one that does not solve her problem, as the numbers returning to Greece would be small. Merkel also needs help from Italy, but its new populist government wants European countries to share the burden of looking after the migrants arriving on its shores. Since Italy began turning away migrant rescue boats from its ports, Europe’s divisions over migration have burst into the open. After days adrift in international waters, the German NGO ship Lifeline, carrying 234 people, has now been allowed to dock at Malta. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, announced that nine European countries, including Malta, had agreed to accept people rescued at sea. European leaders are likely to sidestep the divisive issue of refugee quotas that has roiled the EU since 2015, when Brussels attempted to force through mandatory quotas. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who was recently re-elected after a harsh anti-immigration campaign, made clear his country would not be welcoming refugees. In typically uncompromising language, he said the EU had to stop migrants arriving. “The invasion should be stopped and to stop the invasion means to have a strong border.” Faultlines over managing internal migration means EU leaders will focus on action to prevent migrants arriving in Europe, a policy that commands consensus. EU leaders are expected to call for migrant processing centres to be set up in north African countries, but details remain sketchy. The rightwing Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said that “being rescued in the Mediterranean must not automatically become a ticket to central Europe”. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the EU needed to come to a “Turkey-like agreement” with African countries, a reference to the 2016 migration pact with Ankara that led to a 97% fall in arrivals across the eastern Mediterranean. “We are not ready for the next crisis,” Rutte said, adding that it was not right that countries such as Spain and Italy were left to shoulder all the burden. The EU needed to decide “how to kill the business model of cynical boat smugglers, people dying in the migration sea”, he said. Questions persist about the proposed migrant processing centres, which no African country has agreed to host. The EU will call for further study of “regional disembarkation platforms”, a vague term for a scheme that EU officials admit is lacking detail. Merkel, the architect of the EU-Turkey deal, told German MPs that it was time to seek conversations with African states about deals to return migrants “who absolutely have no right to stay”, modelled on the 2016 agreement. In a 26-minute speech to the German parliament, notably in Seehofer’s absence, Merkel sounded a note of pessimism about the chances of striking an EU-wide deal on migration. Throughout Merkel’s speech she was heckled by delegates of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland. At one point she interrupted her own speech with the words: “My God, seriously now.”"
2018-12-29T16:44:44Z,Sajid Javid cuts holiday short to tackle Channel migrant crossings,"The home secretary, Sajid Javid, is cutting short a family holiday to deal with the growing number of migrants trying to cross the Channel by boat, the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, has said. Javid has faced calls to deploy Royal Navy vessels after he declared the surge in people attempting to cross the channel by boat a “major incident” on Friday. He has appointed a gold commander to deal with the growing crisis and asked for an urgent call with his French counterparts. Speaking during a visit to Dover on Saturday, Nokes said: “I can’t comment on his [Javid’s] whereabouts for security reasons, but he is on his way back and he will be at his desk on Monday. He is taking control of the situation and I am in regular contact with him, and we had a conference call just yesterday.” On Saturday, there were calls from some MPs for the Royal Navy to be sent in or for Border Force cutters to be brought back from the Mediterranean to target traffickers. The MP John Woodcock, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, told the Sun: “The public is losing confidence in the struggling Border Force. It’s time to stop the rot by sending in the Royal Navy. If the civilian force can’t cope, the navy must stop this crisis becoming a catastrophe.” Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, said it would be better to bring Border Force cutters back from the Mediterranean, where they are taking part in search-and-rescue operations. “Border Force officials are trained to protect borders rather more than the Royal Navy,” Elphicke told Sky News. “The navy are very important and very good, but they do other things and border protection is not their key thing.” He called on the French authorities to “match the home secretary’s determination” by stepping up action on their side of the Channel to curtail trafficking routes and prevent people attempting dangerous crossings. However, Nokes said: “It is feasible that were we to put additional craft [out] they might act as a magnet – encouraging people to make a perilous crossing. “What we want to make sure is that we continue to work with the French so that people are prevented from leaving beaches in northern France; to make sure we are providing joint operations both in terms of intelligence [and] policing; and indeed when people are out on the water assisting the French response.” She rejected suggestions not enough was being done to tackle smugglers, saying there was an “enormous intelligence-led operation to make sure that arrests are made in France”. She continued: “Where people’s lives are at risk, people are rescued where necessary.” A union representing Border Force staff said it was “very difficult to know” what the French authorities were doing to prevent people-smuggling from migrant camps in Calais. “We are being told that those touting for these crossings are absolutely open about it,” Lucy Moreton, of the immigration services union, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday. “They are around and about in the camps, they are in the cafes in those areas of Calais. They are very clear, very open, touting for crossings that night. If it’s that obvious to journalists and staff in those areas, then presumably it is obvious to the French authorities too.” Moreton said the two cutters available to Border Force staff patrolling the Channel were “woefully inadequate” but increasing their number would take considerable time. The Home Office has not given official figures about how many migrants have crossed the Channel over the past few months, but the Guardian understands that between January and November 2018, at least 250 migrants were intercepted in the Channel. This includes 65 people, mainly Iranians, in the last three weeks of November alone. Around 82 migrants have been detained crossing the Channel since Christmas Day, with a further 12 men from Syria and Iran intercepted at the end of last week. Ingrid Parrot, the spokeswoman for the French maritime prefecture for the English Channel, told the Today programme: “Before 2018, we didn’t have smugglers. But now we have smugglers on the French coast and it is really a network. “Before that it was not a network, it was individual migrants who were trying to cross. Now it’s a network, a criminal organisation.” She said French authorities exchanged “a lot” of information with UK counterparts about smuggling operations, adding: “When migrants call us, we call MRCC (Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre) at Dover and Border Force to co-operate at sea to help these people, because we really fear finding bodies on the beach.” Charities said the spike in numbers could be due to the difficult conditions in the camps in France, and a growing sense of “now or never” as Brexit loomed. Since the beginning of the year migrants have been crossing the Channel on small boats but charities agree it is a relatively new route for those desperate to reach the UK. Caroline Gregory, who works with Calais Action, which has been supporting migrants in northern France for the past three years, said migrants often attempted to hide themselves on lorries and vans crossing the Channel, a very dangerous method."
2018-12-30T06:00:13Z,"El Paso aid agencies overwhelmed as 1,600 migrants are cast on to streets","The US government has released more than 1,600 migrants on to the streets of El Paso, Texas, this week, overwhelming aid agencies that have scrambled to find shelter for families left to fend for themselves. Advocacy groups said the mass release was “unprecedented”, as volunteers turned out in droves to bring food, water and medicine to migrants stranded in the border city. “It is unacceptable to release families with children, some of them very young children, to the street,” said Ruben Garcia, executive director of Annunciation House, El Paso’s largest migrant shelter operator. “That, we have to say, is a non-negotiable, that is simply not acceptable. Whatever logistics, whatever pressures may exist, we have got to find a system to ensure families are not released to the street.” The chaos began last Sunday night, when 214 people, all families, were released without the usual warning given by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to Annunciation House, Garcia said. Volunteers worked until at least 2am or 3am trying to find shelter, Garcia said. Hundreds of people were then released on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Thursday. Garcia said immigration authorities had coordinated travel for released families with Annunciation House and its network of shelters for “the last five years”, until this week. “I cannot explain to you why that was done,” he said. Garcia said Annunciation House and its local partners have provided space to about 2,200 people a week, and are hoping to expand to at least 3,000 beds a week. The group is spending $150,000 a month for hotel rooms because its shelters are full. On Friday, the El Paso Community Foundation and the Prudential Foundation gave $40,000 to Annunciation House to help pay housing costs. El Paso’s incoming US representative, Veronica Escobar, a Democrat, told CBS News the situation could be exacerbated by an annual college football game, the Sun Bowl, taking place this weekend, because it will bring in tourists who have booked hotel space. She called on the government to build temporary holding facilities and to invest in programs that could help address the poverty and violence driving people to flee from Central America. “As a community, we are going to do whatever we need to do to take care of these people,” Escobar said. “They are vulnerable. They deserve compassion. And help. And support. And El Pasoans always rise to that occasion.” Ice, which must take custody of families within 72 hours of their apprehension by border patrol, said it does not have the capacity to detain or remove families quickly and has cut back reviews of post-release plans for migrants held at the border. In an email, a spokeswoman said: “Ice is redoubling its efforts to work with local and state officials and NGO partners in the area so they are prepared to provide assistance with transportation or other services.” Across the border in Ciudad Juárez, the city’s biggest migrant shelter, Casa del Migrante, said on Christmas Eve it would no longer be able to accept new migrants. Javier Calvillo, director of Casa del Migrante, said the facility only had enough food, water and medicine to care for the nearly 500 people it was already housing. “I think it is important to recognize the limitations, what we have and what we can do,” Calvillo said. In recent months, border towns have been overwhelmed by Trump administration efforts to restrict asylum while thousands of Central Americans continue to arrive. At some of the busiest ports of entry, journalists and humanitarian groups have documented the US government limiting the number of people who can apply for asylum each day, a practice known as “metering”. This month, the supreme court confirmed people can seek asylum anywhere along the US-Mexico border, despite White House attempts to prohibit the practice. Such efforts to curb legal and illegal immigration come as apprehensions of people illegally crossing the border are at their lowest levels since the peak of 1.6 million people in 2000. As of October, 396,579 people had been apprehended this year. The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, visited El Paso on Friday, after being pressured by lawmakers to provide more information on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two Guatemalan children in US Customs and Border Protection custody this month. Jakelin Caal, seven, died on 8 December, less than two days after being apprehended. Her cause of death is not known. Felipe Gómez Alonzo, eight, died late on Christmas Eve. New Mexico authorities said an autopsy showed he had flu, but more tests were needed. Nielsen did not immediately address the situation in El Paso, but did acknowledge that the immigration system was broken. “The system is clearly overwhelmed and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable populations,” Nielsen said in a statement on Saturday, minutes after Trump blamed the children’s deaths on Democrats holding out against his demands to fund a border wall (for which, on the campaign trail, he had promised that Mexico would pay). The Department of Homeland Security has also said it will hold more thorough health screenings for migrants. Bishop Mark Seitz, of the Catholic diocese of El Paso, said he understood government facilities were overcrowded but turning people on to the street without money, food or access to phones was “inhumane and unconscionable”. “Our government has a responsibility when it takes these refugees into custody to provide for their basic needs. We do as much for death row inmates,” Seitz said in a statement. “With the recent deaths of two young children, the accounts of mistreatment in holding cells and the heartless expulsion of these families an undeniable picture is coming into focus and it is not one of which we Americans can be proud.”"
2018-11-02T15:41:03Z,"Migrant caravan families face illness, exhaustion and danger","As their fellow travellers rested along the side of the road, Walter Hernández and his four-year-old son David tossed a bouncy yellow ball back and forth amid the black soot of burned-off brush. The acrid smell of smoke still lingered as they played. But all was not well, confided Hernández. “My son has a cough and can’t sleep, and my daughter has a fever,” he said, nodding towards two-year-old Génesis, whose face was buried in her mother’s shoulder. In the three weeks since setting out from San Pedro Sula in Honduras, the caravan of migrants travelling across southern Mexico has crossed two borders and covered more than 1,000 km (621 miles), passing through police roadblocks, disaster zones, sweltering heat and torrential downpours. And the trek is taking an increasingly heavy toll on the travellers, especially parents and young children – many of whom are too small to understand the epic journey. The group – which at one point swelled to around 7,000 people – has now shrunk to about 4,000 as members chose to seek asylum in Mexico or succumbed to exhaustion and illness. Members of the group complain of coughs and colds, blisters and sunburns, insect bites and eye infections. Nobody knows how many children are with the caravan now, although last week the UN children’s agency put the figure at around 2,300. They travel sprawled in strollers, or slung sweatily across their parents’ chests – or they trudge along the roadside. There has been at least one death – a man, who fell from a truck soon after the group entered Mexico – and one birth: a baby girl was born on Wednesday, to a Guatemalan woman in the town of Juchitán. On Thursday, the first members of the group reached the town of Matías Romero on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the slender waist of Mexico where Pacific and Gulf coasts lie just 220km (137 miles) apart. Although few in the caravan have a clear idea of their eventual route, crossing the isthmus will lead them to the Gulf state of Veracruz – a region which has long been a death trap for migrants. Farther away, Donald Trump has seized on the caravan ahead of US midterms, tweeting feverishly about an “invasion”, mobilizing troops on the US border, and promising to intern migrants in “tent cities”. By now – thanks mainly to the sizable media pack which has followed the caravan for most of its journey – most members of the group are aware that Trump does not want them. But they remain hopeful that they will reach the US, a country they often see as an idealised country of justice and opportunity – in contrast, they say, to the corruption and violence back home. And parents say they have no choice but to bring their children to avoid forced recruitment, sexual assault or murder by the gangs which dominate many Central American towns. Hernández, a wiry farmhand from the north coast of Honduras, fled with his family after gangs gave him an ultimatum: join “or we’ll mess with your family”. Like many others, he heard about the caravan on local news, and decided that travelling with others would improve his chances in Mexico, where migrants are often targeted by organised crime. On a recent afternoon, he and his family were travelling in a party of 10, who had taken a break amid the burned-out scrub at the roadside. He had turned down offers of rides for his wife, Kénia, and their ailing daughter Génesis, because they didn’t want to risk being separated, and they were hoping that a Red Cross ambulance might pass by and give them a lift as they had before. Others weren’t so choosy: a family of four climbed out of the bed of a farm vehicle hauling cows and goats, dung still stuck to the wheels of their stroller, which had given them a lift. The journey remains fraught with danger: when the group crossed the international bridge from Guatemala several families were separated in the crush; some parents bound themselves to their children with lengths of cord so they could stay together. Rumors abound that child snatchers are shadowing the caravan, said Keila Castro, 29, who was begging by the roadside with her son Gerson, six, to raise money for a ride in a minibus. They left Honduras with nothing more than the clothes on their back after a local gang threatened Castro’s husband. Gerson grinned bashfully, but Castro said it was tough to travel with a six-year old. “He’s not as tough as us and he gets very tired.” The caravan tends to splinter throughout, as each member makes their way to the next way station, only to regroup each night in the square of the next town, where they often sleep. Castro and her husband always try for a spot in the centre of the group, and squeeze Gerson between them for safety. “You sleep with one eye open,” she said. So far, the group has averaged about 60km (37 miles) a day. They gather in evening assemblies, and vote on major decisions, such as when to rest, and where to head to next. All the way, they have depended on the kindness of strangers, hitching rides in rubbish trucks and taxis, and sleeping in town squares, local people’s homes, or collapsed on the wayside. Earlier this week, they reached the town of Niltepec, which was almost completely destroyed in a 2017 earthquake, where residents – who still live amid the rubble of that disaster – welcomed the caravan with homemade soup. “We wish we had a space dignified enough to offer our visitors,” Zelfareli Cruz Medina, the local mayor told the Associated Press. At each stop, a team of missionary nuns has tended to the migrants’ blistered feet; many of the walkers are on their second or third pair of flip-flops or crocs. Churches, municipal governments and generous locals have kept them clothed and fed. The local distributor of the baked-good behemoth Bimbo donated more than 1,000 loaves of white bread at one of the stops. The caravan sets out early, often hitting the road at 2am or 3am to take advantage of the cooler temperatures before sunrise. But the day was already sweltering on a recent afternoon when a group of weary marchers caught up with a line of traffic which had ground to a halt at a federal police roadblock. One exhausted father yelled out to a taxi stuck in the jam: “How much for a ride? I’ll pay you double.” “I’m full,” the driver replied. “I’ll pay triple.” The taxi driver shook his head. Meanwhile, young men from the caravan climbed aboard slow-moving vehicles, including delivery trucks and a gasoline tanker. They also swarmed a double flatbed trailer, pushing past families to take the coveted spots. “They’re just so selfish,” said Sebastian Castillo, who was pushing his five-year-old daughter in a stroller. Jenny Gutiérrez, 18, watched the trucks laden with young men roll past her as she walked along the roadside. She was four and a half months pregnant – something she had only discovered after setting out on the journey. “The worst is the sun,” she said, but that was closely followed by the nausea, the sore throat, and having to bathe in rivers. Gutiérrez had fled her home to escape gang members who demanded a cut of the meagre income she made selling fruit on the streets. She had no idea where she was heading, but no intention of turning back. “There’s no future in El Salvador,” she shrugged."
2018-12-19T18:11:07Z,UK and German immigration: a tale of two very different laws,"Two European countries announced radical overhauls of their immigration rules on Wednesday, but there the similarity ended. Britain, where concerns about long-term impacts of immigration helped drive the 2016 vote to leave the European Union, billed its stricter regime as “a route to strengthened border security and an end to free movement”. Germany, however, facing such a shortage of workers that is threatening economic growth, said it was easing immigration rules to attract more foreign job-seekers. In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the British home secretary, Sajid Javid, stressed that the Conservatives’ 2017 election manifesto had made clear the party’s “commitment to bring net migration down”. His counterpart in Germany, Horst Seehofer, said: “We need manpower from third countries to safeguard our prosperity and fill our job vacancies.” The economy minister, Peter Altmaier, hailed the new law – keenly awaited by business - as historic. Britain’s priority appears primarily to be establishing a system of tough controls capable of keeping certain people out. Business has accused the government of putting a political imperative for restriction before the needs of the economy. In contrast, by introducing looser visa procedures and reducing red tape Germany’s emphasis appears to be on making it easier for certain people to enter and to stay. Some in Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance and in the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have said such a move ignores public concerns about immigration. The UK’s system does not put a cap on numbers but aims to reduce annual net migration to “sustainable levels”. It requires skilled workers to earn a minimum salary, to be decided next year. After Brexit there would be no more special treatment for EU citizens; a transitional temporary worker scheme would allow them, and workers of any skill level from other “low risk” countries, to enter Britain without a job offer for up to 12 months. Business leaders have warned that the system will leave the UK poorer, depriving industry of a migrant workforce on which it has depended. The proposed £30,000 salary threshold for skilled workers would leave hospitals, the contstruction and hospitality sectors, manufacturing, agriculture and logistics desperately short of labour, they said. Germany’s Fachkräftezuwanderungsgesetz, or skilled labour immigration law, will allow skilled workers such as cooks, metallurgy workers and IT technicians to enter the country for six months to try to find a job, provided they can support themselves financially. More controversially, the law will offer the prospect of permanent residency to asylum seekers who have a job and speak good German but currently face deportation if their asylum applications are turned down. Immigration has been a key political issue in Germany since Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, when the country absorbed more than 1 million mostly Muslim refugees and migrants, sparking a xenophobic backlash and surge of support for the anti-immigration AfD in federal and regional elections. Ministers stressed the new rules were a “pragmatic solution” to a pressing economic problem. The AfD said they would fuel immigration, providing “a fresh incentive for people from around the world to come”. In Germany, however, those politics have not, so far, prevailed."
2018-06-26T15:19:31Z,What Europe could learn from the way Africa treats refugees | Alexander Betts,"Across Europe, asylum policies are failing both refugees and citizens. Attempts to negotiate a fair distribution of refugees within Europe are deadlocked, and this week’s emergency EU summit on migration seems unlikely to yield a breakthrough. Just about the only thing that European governments have been able to agree upon is the creation of migration partnerships with African countries. These agreements focus on strengthening borders, reducing departures, and increasing the number of returns of migrants trying to cross to Europe. Niger has become Europe’s largest recipient of development aid; not because of a surge in altruism but because it is the most significant migrant route to Libya and the Mediterranean. But when it comes to refugees, Europe should think differently about African states. Instead of just being objects of inducement and coercion, many should offer inspiration. Africa now hosts more refugees than any region of the world. And yet some are adopting pioneering solutions from which the rest of the world might learn. Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, was correct when he said this week: “Those shouting about a refugee emergency in Europe or America should visit African communities giving refuge to millions with small resources.” Take three East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. Their average GDP per capita is about 20 times less than Europe’s. And yet they collectively host about* 2.8 million refugees, more than the entire number to arrive in all of Europe’s 28 member states during the entire 2015-16 “refugee crisis”. Uganda has been widely lauded as one of the most progressive refugee-hosting countries in the world. In contrast to many low-income host countries, it allows refugees the right to work and freedom of movement. It recognised from independence that enabling rural refugees to cultivate under-populated plots of land offered a means to support national development. By the 1990s, the approach had been formalised as “the self-reliance strategy”. Research shows that both refugees and the host community benefit from the approach. Refugees can establish businesses, many of which trade with and employ host nationals. Even as Uganda’s refugee numbers swelled to 1.4 million during the recent South Sudanese and Congolese conflicts, the government remained staunchly committed to the approach. As new emergency camps have been created to accommodate recent arrivals, the right to work has encouraged the development of new local market towns, creating opportunities for many Ugandans. Neighbouring Kenya’s refugee policies are generally regarded as far more restrictive than those of Uganda. Its “encampment policy” has denied its 500,000 refugees the right to work or move freely since the early 1990s. However, there has been recent progress, with Kenya recently opening a new refugee camp in Kalobeyei along a similar self-reliance model. In contrast to the country’s established camps, it creates greater opportunities for agriculture and entrepreneurship, and a shared marketplace for refugees and the local population. The evidence suggests the model leads to higher incomes and better food security than in more traditional camps. Ethiopia is also gradually moving from an approach based on encampment to one that supports self-reliance. At a global summit in New York in September 2016, it announced that it would commit to a series of nine pledges to refugee protection. Chief among these is the right to work and freedom of movement for its 900,000 refugees. The government is also pioneering new operational models to support job creation. For example, it is building state-of-the-art industrial zones, which will provide jobs to both refugees and Ethiopian nationals from 2019. One of the main lessons we can learn from these examples is that the economic inclusion of refugees can be good for everyone. And yet European governments limit asylum seekers’ right to work. In the UK, refugees have to wait 12 months before they can apply for a restricted set of jobs. But in order to make full economic participation possible, the communities which they are settling in need to support refugees. This becomes possible if they share in the benefits. Across Africa, development agencies preach the idea that effective refugee policies must also empower host communities. In Europe, host communities should similarly receive additional support for public services and jobs so that they perceive the presence of refugees as a benefit. Africa’s progressive models have only been possible because of local political champions, like Josphat Nanok, the governor of Kenya’s Turkana County. Creating change in Europe will require similar leadership. Given that the overwhelming majority of refugees are not in Europe, it makes sense to invest in supporting refugees where they are, especially in African states with progressive approaches. Not all refugees need to come to Europe and most probably would not want to. Ironically, the numbers coming to Europe may be more likely to go down if we focus on creating socioeconomic anchors rather than deterrence and building walls. None of these African models is perfect. But they remind us that, when it comes to refugees, positive things are happening beyond Europe. We should support Africa’s economic inclusion of refugees, and we might even learn from it. • Alexander Betts is professor of forced migration and international affairs at the University of Oxford."
2018-12-01T14:29:06Z,Police with batons and teargas force migrants to flee Calais camp,"French police have stepped up attempts to drive out refugees from Calais, with camp evictions in the area running at a record 20 clearances a week, according to comprehensive new analysis. The data reveals that the French authorities carried out 78 separate camp clearances in October and 77 in September, a figure that has steadily increased over the year and is seven times higher than the number of Calais evictions being reported during the summer. Charities say the tempo of operations is causing unprecedented hardship for the 1,500 refugees currently gathered in makeshift camps around the French port. Refugees often lose their tents, provisions and other possessions during evictions, which are also blamed by charities for prompting a recent spike in attempts to cross the Channel by boat. More than 100 people have entered British waters in boats from northern France this month, with traffickers said to be charging each of them up to £6,000 a trip. A detailed report to be released this week by the Calais-based organisation Human Rights Observers and French group L’Auberge des Migrants shows that between November 2017 and November 2018 French police carried out 393 separate camp evictions against refugees in the port area. The repeated destruction of the camps around Calais has forced many of the refugees – largely Afghan, Eritrean or Sudanese men aged between 18 and 25 alongside a much smaller population of Iranians – to sleep without shelter in woods or beneath motorway bridges on the outskirts of Calais. One Eritrean man, Hlebi, 22, nodded towards an open field beside the Avenue Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and said: “That is where I sleep with my friends. The police took our tent and when they come we run away because they have beaten us before.” One of his friends, a 27-year-old called Ife, also from Asmara, and who has been trying to reach the UK for more than a year, said: “Most nights the police looking for us, sleeping is dangerous.” Another, Mehari, 21, visibly shaking in the stiff winter breeze, added: “They [the police] have slashed our tents many times; why can’t they leave us in peace?” The report, to be released on Wednesday, also documents alleged levels of violence and intimidation by French police against refugees with almost 1,000 complaints collated by researchers during the 12 months to November. It is the first time that levels of violence and harassment by the French authorities against refugees have been documented in detail over a sustained period. As temperatures fall, conditions for the refugees camped around Calais have, according to charities, never been worse, with many cases of hypothermia already reported. Maddy Allen, field manager in France for the charity Help Refugees, also revealed that in recent weeks tuberculosis had made a comeback with three cases of the disease recently diagnosed. Allen said the five current camps established in the Calais area had recently been levelled four times each per week, a policy they said was also inflicting profound psychological damage on the occupants. She added: “It forces people to be constantly on the move. Tents once used to last six months, but because of this they now last barely six days. It’s an incredibly hostile environment at the moment, conditions are the worst they have ever been.” Further figures corroborate the misery now facing migrants, with local charities revealing that refugees were taken to a special medical unit at the city’s hospital 570 times in September alone. Injuries included broken bones allegedly caused by police batons, and the effects of teargas. Dozens of testimonies from migrants alleging police violence are chronicled in the report, including a number of minors who experienced physical violence and were targeted by “chemical agents” allegedly fired by officers. In total it reveals 972 complaints were made by refugees in Calais against police over the 12-month period, with 244 of these involving alleged violence involving batons or teargas. Charlotte Head, of the Human Rights Observers project, an organisation set up in October 2017 to specifically quantify and investigate levels of violence by the French police against refugees, said that one case currently being investigated involves allegations that a 15-year-old was blinded by a projectile that may have been fired by French police. Head added: “Other cases include chemical agents sprayed in the mouths of refugees, minors kicked in the head while they are lying on the floor. The incidents are a tiny fraction of what we suspect actually occur. Most incidents occur at night-time to avoid us being witnesses or when the victim is alone. People are becoming very isolated and very vulnerable, and we are seeing high levels of police violence.” Paul Leclerc of L’Auberge des Migrants said that the present situation was far more grave than when the Calais refugee camp – then known as the Jungle – was destroyed in October 2016. “Conditions are much worse now,” he said. “The Jungle was a slum – we called it Bidonville – but it was still a ville [town], with its own community and support. Now people are spread out without shelter. “Many do not manage to sleep more than four hours a night; that in itself has severe psychological effects.” News of the French attempts to make life intolerable for the Calais refugees comes as it emerges that the UK will not accept any more children under the Dubs scheme – even if they are eligible. Last week France Terre d’Asile, the French charity that works with government to identify unaccompanied minors, told local groups that it had no more available spaces for the transfer of children from France to the UK, after filling up an extra final allocation of 60 given to it by the Home Office. By contrast, said Allen, Greece has so far sent only a handful of unaccompanied minors to the UK under the Dubs scheme and almost 2,000 unaccompanied children are on a waiting list for shelter."
2018-12-27T12:43:22Z,Home Office tried to remove second migrant over Christmas period,"The Home Office attempted to remove from the UK a second vulnerable migrant over the Christmas period, the Guardian has learned. The 29-year-old woman, believed to be a victim of trafficking, was scheduled for removal by the Home Office on Boxing Day despite officials accepting she is at high risk of suicide. Her removal was deferred after her lawyer made urgent representations to the Home Office about the trafficking victim’s unfitness to fly. Her case followed that of the Congolese asylum seeker Otis Bolamu, 38, who was facing forced removal from the UK on Christmas Day. Bolamu’s removal was also deferred at the 11th hour after the Guardian reported his story, and following a petition launched by his supporters. The 29-year-old woman was trafficked from South America and detained in Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre after she was found to be working illegally. She disclosed that she had been trafficked and had been forced to hand over her wages to her trafficker, but due to minor inconsistencies in her account the Home Office rejected her trafficking case. The Home Office accepted that the woman is an “adult at risk” and placed her on constant suicide watch. Officials also placed her in segregation. However, despite the concerns about her mental health she was due to be removed back to her home country on Wednesday. Medical notes from Yarl’s Wood state that the woman’s “accounts of events are consistent with her scars and she could be a victim of torture”. She was assessed by an independent psychiatrist who found her to be in a state of “severe mental distress” and “at significant risk of suicide”. He said that she was not fit to fly. Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who is representing both the woman and Bolamu, expressed concern about the Home Office’s practice of removing vulnerable people during the festive season, when they are less likely to be able to access legal advice that could stop their removals. Bolamu was imprisoned and tortured by government agents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a result of his opposition to the government of Joseph Kabila. He had been living in Home Office accommodation in Swansea and volunteering at an Oxfam shop. He was seized in a dawn raid at about 4am last Thursday and, after first being held in Bridgend, was taken to Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick. Bell said: “The Home Office attempted to remove a potential victim of trafficking and domestic abuse who was segregated due to her active self-harm and suicidal ideation to the country where she was horrendously exploited. She was totally confused and terrified of returning, so much that she planned to take her own life. “The policy of Christmas removals is one that severely impedes full and entitled representation. We struggle to see how arresting Otis Bolamu in a dawn raid at 4am on 19 December and telling him that he was to be returned on Christmas Day can be considered reasonable and proportionate action. We are very happy removal was deferred and we will have time to work on his further submissions. “The holidays are supposed to be a time for joy and togetherness, not for the Home Office to take advantage to try to forcibly remove individuals to countries where they are fearful of return.” ﻿A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection. All asylum claims lodged in the UK are carefully considered on their individual merits against a background of relevant case law and up-to-date country information.”"
2018-06-17T04:59:06Z,The Observer view on migrants dying because Europe is pandering to populism | Observer editorial,"The plight of Aquarius, the rescue ship carrying 629 migrants, stands as a potent reminder of the dire failings of European migration policy. No matter that the ship carried seven pregnant women and more than a hundred unaccompanied children rescued at sea as they tried to make the desperate, dangerous crossing from Libya to Italy. First Italy, then Malta, refused the ship entry to their ports. Eventually, Spain offered to let it dock in the port of Valencia, four days away in harsh sailing conditions. Spain’s socialist foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said this was a “symbolic act” to try to impel more coordinated action from a continent engaged in “ostrich politics”. But the sad truth is that since 2015 – the year that the scale of the migration crisis became clear – the European appetite for a common, humanitarian approach to migrant and refugee flows from Africa and the Middle East has only dwindled. The Spanish gesture seems highly unlikely to prompt a desperately needed rethink. In recent years, the thrust of European policy has shifted from improving conditions for those seeking refuge within Europe, to stemming irregular migration flows regardless of the humanitarian cost. The philosophy appears to be that, so long as there are no drowned toddlers washing up on Greek beaches, Europe is discharging its moral and legal duties, regardless of whether ultimately they end up dead elsewhere. As a result, the numbers of people coming across the Mediterranean have dropped dramatically, not because of an easing of the conflicts that drive them to seek sanctuary, but because European leaders have struck unsavoury deals with dictatorial states and repressive regimes to stop people arriving. Europe has channelled cash to Turkey and countries in Africa in exchange for their help in deporting unwanted migrants and preventing people from leaving for Europe. This has simply shifted the focus, not the scale, of the humanitarian problem – from drownings in the Mediterranean, to exploitation, rape and torture elsewhere. Conditions in Libyan detention camps are appalling, and UN agencies say the Libyan coastguard – funded by the EU to return migrants to its shores – is co-operating with smugglers. Aid money is flowing to some of the most repressive and dictatorial regimes, such as in Sudan, whose abuses are driving the exodus of people trying to escape dangerous and desperate conditions in the first place. The millions of Syrian refugees living in countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan face terrible and worsening conditions as a result of cutbacks to UN aid. This approach is entirely counter-productive: the more that Europe focuses on making it less safe for people fleeing war and destruction to cross the Mediterranean, the more they are driven into the hands of criminal smugglers. The European-backed destruction of the wooden boats used by smugglers for the Libya-Italy crossing has simply led to more people attempting to make the journey on even more dangerous rubber dinghies, pushing up the death rate further. Meanwhile, in Europe, thousands of refugees and migrants are trapped in intolerable conditions in camps on the Greek islands as they wait for their asylum applications to be processed, where there is a huge backlog. There have been no meaningful efforts to reform the Dublin regulation, which says refugees must be processed by the first EU country they set foot in and be sent back there if they move on to other parts of Europe. This has created the preposterous state of affairs in which two of Europe’s poorer countries, Italy and Greece, have been left to process the biggest volumes of asylum claims. Some argue that the Fortress Europe approach, based on preventing people from arriving here in the first place, is the only pragmatic response to the populists who have sought to make hay from the migration issue. But the truth is that in buying into the populist frame of irregular migration flows as a European crisis, and a mortal threat to European values, mainstream politicians have created the oxygen populists need to thrive. In Italy, the policy of closing ports to migrant rescue ships did not originate with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s new populist interior minister, but with his centre-left predecessor, Marco Minniti. A failure to develop a fair, pan-European system based on resettlement quotas and a commonly funded network of reception centres has fuelled the anger of citizens in southern Europe; it is not surprising that far-right parties have capitalised on it. Today, Europe remains more divided than ever. The populist nationalist approach, long championed by the Visegrád bloc, is gaining wider traction, with the interior ministers of Austria, Italy and Germany announcing a new “axis” of cooperation on security and immigration. Support for once-fringe ideas, such as asylum processing centres in Africa, is growing; even as Macron has offered to take in some of the Aquarius migrants who dock in Spain, he has reiterated his backing. This is being talked of as an existential crisis for an increasingly isolated Angela Merkel, whose own interior minister has threatened to defy her by introducing controls on Germany’s southern border. But – far more than Brexit – it is an existential crisis for the EU itself. Will Europe continue in its race to the bottom, or will leaders be able to come together to develop a shared, humanitarian approach to irregular migration? The answer will shape the very future of the European project."
2018-12-02T04:14:37Z,Setback for Australian refugee football player arrested in Thailand,"A refugee football player who was hoping to return to Australia over the weekend after being arrested in Thailand has been put into detention instead and is facing deportation to the country he fled from. Hakeem Al-Araibi was arrested at Bangkok airport last week on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain’s request. The 25-year-old told SBS News on Sunday that Thai authorities “discreetly” ordered him to book a flight out of the country. He booked a flight to Melbourne departing Saturday at 9pm. But three hours before the flight he was told he would not be flying to Australia and was taken to Bangkok’s immigration detention centre. Al-Araibi’s lawyer, Latifa Al-Haouli, told SBS News that authorities from the Bahraini government and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs were “pleading their cases” in regard to his detention. “I haven’t heard of Hakeem yet as of this morning. We’ve been told that Dfat is doing all that they can but I think they need to be doing more,” she said. The Bahraini embassy in Thailand issued statements on Twitter on Sunday saying they were “following up with the relevant security authorities” and that “the suspect is wanted for security cases”. Last week Al-Araibi told Guardian Australia he was arrested on an Interpol red notice for his conviction over an act of vandalism in Bahrain which he denies and says allegedly happened while he was playing in a televised football game. Since 2015 Interpol has said it would not allow red notices against confirmed refugees and asylum seekers from the countries they fled from. “When I arrived at immigration in Thailand they took me to detention and said you have a red notice from Bahrain,” he said from detention. “I told them I am a refugee in Australia. I said [Bahrain] is not allowed to take me … I have been in Australia for four-and-a-half years now. But they took me to detention.” Al-Araibi arrived in Australia in 2015 and was granted refugee status and permanent residency three years later. A former member of Bahrain’s national football team, he has previously described being tortured and beaten by authorities who had accused him and other football players of setting fire to a police station, and he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in jail. Al-Araibi denies the charge and claims he was playing in a televised football match at the time of the alleged incident. The players and their families are believed to have been targeted for their involvement in peaceful protests against the ruling family during the Arab Spring of 2011. A number of the players targeted alongside Al-Araibi were also reportedly granted refuge in Australia, where Al-Araibi now plays for a Melbourne team. He has since publicly spoken against Sheikh Salman Alkhalifa, cousin of the Bahraini king and current president of the Asian Football Confederation, doing multiple interviews with media while Alkhalifa campaigned for the presidency of Fifa. Last week a spokeswoman for Dfat told Guardian Australia: “Australian embassy officials in Bangkok are in direct contact with Thai authorities regarding this issue. Owing to our privacy obligations we will not provide further comment.” Al-Araibi’s support team have expressed concern that he would get less assistance from the Australian government because he is not a citizen, and called for urgent action to prevent his deportation to Bahrain. “I spoke to someone from the Australian embassy in Thailand. She said just wait for immigration in Thailand because she sent them more information,” said Al-Araibi. He said he checked with Australian and Thai authorities before leaving, and both had assured him of his safety. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “Interpol has violated its obligations, as Hakeem holds refugee status and returning him to Bahrain puts him at significant risk of torture and imprisonment. “His deportation would undoubtedly damage the reputation of Interpol’s newly elected president early into his tenure.”"
2018-10-24T17:29:25Z,The Guardian view on the migrant convoy: a heroic journey | Editorial,"The six or seven thousand people – men, women, and children – who have set out to walk 3,000 miles through Mexico to reach the US are brave, resourceful and determined to better themselves. They might become the kind of citizens that every country needs and whose support any politician should be proud of. Naturally, they are objects of loathing for President Trump, a man whose entire life has been cushioned by privilege. He has done his best to exploit their misery in advance of the midterm elections, claiming that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” are mixed in with them. There have been many such caravans before now, and there will be many afterwards. They are a natural reaction to the difficulties and dangers that lone travellers, especially women and children, face when they attempt to reach the prosperous world. The wise and sensible thing to do would be to treat them as an opportunity to manage migration – but the nativist reaction is to treat them as a giant jailbreak. For Mr Trump and, indeed, for some other western policymakers, the function of poor countries is to keep poor people locked up. Aid to the Central American countries from which the caravan has fled is conditional on their “doing the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the US” to quote another of his presidential tweets. This view of Central America as a prison colony is grimly reflected in the US justice system. Many experts point out that the chaos in Central America can in part be attributed to the mass deportation of gang members and suspected gang members from the US, whether or not they grew up there. These gangs originated inside the Californian prison system and among its clientele on the outside. They are not native to the countries they are now destroying. It is their victims who are fleeing on foot to the US. The murder rate in parts of Honduras is the highest anywhere in the world outside of war zones. Much of this violence is fuelled by drugs, and the money from the drug trade, which also comes in the last analysis from the US. The idea that these countries and their inhabitants can be walled off from US politics, and the US economy, is a poisonous fantasy. But it has served Mr Trump well and he will continue to exploit it. In theory there is a policy of enlightened self-interest that would help to mitigate the worst effects of this traffic. Sufficient aid to the countries from which they come would help to enable the development of both the economy and the kind of security and access to justice that they desperately need. This was the policy pursued under the Obama administration, which Mr Trump is now demolishing. Since 2015, “addressing the root causes of migration” has also been a key theme of official EU strategy. As a means of stemming the flow of refugees this will be effective only in the long term. Civil societies grow over time. They can’t be prefabricated abroad and helicoptered into place like disaster housing. But increasing aid to help stabilise societies is a policy still worth pursuing, though care must be taken not to undermine poorer countries’ ownership of development policies. In the meantime, these caravans should be treated as the humanitarian emergency they are, and their inhabitants welcomed for their courage and spirit."
2018-12-03T06:22:25Z,Fears grow for Australian-based refugee detained in Thailand,"There are fears an Australian-based refugee could swiftly be deported to Bahrain from Thailand, after the man’s wife said she was told by local immigration authorities he had been “taken” and “would not return”. He was later able to call his wife and told her he was in a prison near the airport and his travel documents had been taken from him. Hakeem Al-Araibi arrived in Bangkok for a holiday last week but was arrested on the basis of an Interpol red notice, which is not supposed to be issued against refugees. The red notice was issued by Bahrain, the country Al-Araibi fled and was granted asylum from by the Australian government. His lawyer, Latifa Al-Haouli told Guardian Australia Al-Araibi’s wife said he was “taken” but didn’t know where. She was only told “he will not return”, the lawyer said. The Australian department of foreign affairs would not comment on the development, reiterating its earlier statement that its Bangkok embassy officials were in “direct contact” with Thai authorities, but it could not comment further due to privacy. There is a direct flight from Bangkok to Bahrain at 8.50pm local time. Thai immigration authorities had told 25-year-old Al-Araibi on Sunday they would allow him to return to Australia on Tuesday if Bahrain had not sought his extradition by then. He was told on Friday to book a flight home to Australia for Saturday night, but then on Saturday afternoon he was told he was no longer allowed to leave, and he was transferred from the airport to immigration detention. The abrupt change came shortly after a tweet from Bahrain’s embassy in Thailand which said “the suspect is wanted for security cases which the Embassy is aware of”. The embassy said it was “following up with the relevant security authorities in this regard. “I don’t want to stay here,” Al-Araibi told Guardian Australia shortly before he was taken. “I’m a refugee in Australia, I’m scared of the Bahraini government … They will kill me. I don’t know what’s going to happen there. My life will end if I go to Bahrain.” The existence and acceptance of the red notice raised concerns about alleged abuse of the international arrest warrant system. “Under no circumstances can he be sent to Bahrain,” the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Phil Robertson, said. “Interpol Red Notices do not apply to recognised refugees like Hakeem al-Araibi”. Al-Araibi said last week he had spoken with an Australian embassy employee who told him to wait, but he wanted someone to visit him. “No one has come to see me,” he said. “No one has come here. My lawyer said maybe someone from the Australian embassy would come here to meet me but no one has come here yet.” Al-Araibi fled from Bahrain in 2014 after being detained and tortured, and has been living as a refugee in Australia, playing football for a team in Melbourne. A Bahrain court sentenced him in absentia to 10 years in jail over an alleged act of vandalism which he has long denied and said occurred at the same time he was playing in a televised football match for the Bahrain national team. The couple had planned to holiday in Thailand, and Al-Araibi said he checked with Australian authorities that he was OK to travel. He flew to Bangkok ahead of his wife on Australian travel documents. Al-Araibi told Guardian Australia the Thai officers had shown him the red notice when he was arrested but he didn’t have a copy, didn’t know when it was issued, and didn’t know it existed until that point. Human rights observers have pointed to the fact that in 2015 Interpol’s general assembly officially changed its policies to ban the issuing of red notices against refugees by countries which they fled from. It said this was to formalise a process already in place after being adopted in mid 2014. Al-Araibi was not officially granted asylum in Australia until 2017, more than three years after he arrived. He had previously travelled internationally without issue. Supporters suspect the red notice may have been issued after Al-Araibi spoke to media in 2016, alleging torture and abuse at the hands of Bahraini authorities. In media interviews he was also critical of the current president of the Asian Football Confederation, Sheikh Salman Alkhalifa, during Alkhalifa’s bid for the FIFA presidency that year. Guardian Australia asked Interpol a number of questions about Al-Araibi’s red notice but was told the agency could not comment on specific cases “except in special circumstances and with the approval of the member country concerned” – in this case Bahrain. The 2015 policy change enabled Interpol to “support member countries in preventing criminals from abusing refugee status, while providing adequate and effective safeguards to protect the rights of refugees”, a spokesman said. “In general, the processing of Red Notices and diffusions against refugees will not be allowed if the status of refugee or asylum-seeker has been confirmed and the notice/diffusion has been requested by the country where the individual fears persecution. “However, a challenge still facing this process is the reluctance of countries to confirm if they have granted refugee status to an individual.” The human rights organisation Fair Trials has campaigned for changes to Interpol, including the way it issues and reviews red notices. “We believe that its systems – particularly its international ‘wanted person’ alerts (“Red Notices”) are being abused by countries around the world in order to persecute refugees, journalists and peaceful political demonstrators, at huge personal cost to these individuals,” the organisation has said. Fair Trials has previously assisted others including Sayed Abdellatif, an Egyptian man sentenced in absentia in Egypt after he fled in 1992, who was held – and remains – in immigration detention in Australia."
2018-10-24T16:19:32Z,Where is the migrant caravan from – and what will happen to it at the border?,"Thousands of Central American migrants, including men, women and entire families, are walking through southern Mexico, in the hope of reaching the US. How many people are in the caravan? The group has grown steadily since setting out from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula on 12 October, but the exact size is unclear as there is no single organizing group. Mexico’s interior ministry put the figure at 4,500 on Tuesday; local officials in the town Huixtla estimated the number of participants at closer to 6,000, while UN officials said there were 7,200 migrants. Some people have already abandoned the caravan: 1,699 people have applied for asylum in Mexico, and 495 Hondurans have asked to be repatriated, according to the Mexican government. Where are they from? The caravan started in Honduras and most of its participants are from that country, as well as El Salvador, Guatemala and some from Nicaragua. Reporters travelling with the caravan have seen no evidence to support Donald Trump’s allegation that “Middle Easterners” had infiltrated the group, although migrants from Africa and Asia routinely travel through Mexico to reach the US. Adam Isacson from the Washington Office on Latin America said that US and Mexican statistics show that just 869 people from the “Middle East, Af-Pak and Saharan countries” were detained in the US border zone in 2017 – which represents 0.5% of total apprehensions in Mexico and an even smaller percentage of the US total. Who organized the caravan? In interviews, Honduran members of the group said that they learned about the caravan from Facebook posts, and a report on the local HCH television station, which erroneously suggested that a former congressman and radio host would cover the costs of the journey. After that, rumours spread quickly, including the mistaken promise that any member would be given asylum in the US. Darwin Ramos, 30, said he was desperate to flee threats from a local drug gang, and when news of the caravan reached his neighbourhood, he seized on it as his best chance to escape. Why did people join the caravan? People in the group say they are fleeing grinding poverty, and the violent crime which has helped turn Central America into one of the most dangerous regions of the world. Brian Delarta, 30, a mechanic from La Ceiba, Honduras, showed a pair gunshot wounds in the shoulder and leg – the result of a gang shootout in his neighbourhood, he said. Like many other Honduran migrants, he said that low pay, rising prices for basics such as food, water and electricity and extortion demands from the local gang had made it impossible to make ends meet. A few Nicaraguan families in the group say they fled their country to escape political unrest and the violent government crackdown which has claimed more than 300 lives. Migrants say traveling en masse saves them from having to pay a coyote, or people smuggler, and offers some hope of protection from bandits who target migrants for kidnap, extortion and rape, as well as Mexican migration checkpoints which have sprung up across the country. Where are they going? No one in the group seems to know exactly which route they will take through Mexico. At the moment, the caravan is moving along the sparsely populated coast of the southern state of Chiapas, more than 1,243 miles (2,000km) from the US border. According to activist Jorge Andrade, migrants used take about 10 days to reach the US, but Mexico’s migration crackdown forces people to take more circuitous – and dangerous – routes, and the journey can now take months. Some people have mentioned climbing aboard the freight train known as La Bestia to hitch a ride through Mexico, but migration officials and bandits have made that a much less popular route in recent years. Some have speculated that the caravan might take a longer route towards California where they may hope to receive more sympathetic treatment in immigration courts than they would do at closer border crossings in Texas. Who is helping the members of the caravan? The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has said that the Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, told him that the caravan was being financed by the Venezuelan government, but neither has offered any evidence to support the claim, and reporters traveling with the group have seen no sign of Venezuelan involvement. Instead, most of the practical support has come from ordinary Mexicans, who have given everything from bottled water and clothes to tamales and ice cream to the passing migrants. Restaurant owner Rafael Gómez served 200 plates of beans, rice and tortillas to the group when they reached the town of Huixtla. “The people with the least are the ones helping the most,” he said. The local mayor, José Luis Laparra Calderón, said the municipality chipped in with food and drink, and also provided tarpaulin shelters. “There’s no assistance from the federal or state governments,” he said. Members of the migrant advocacy group Pueblo Sin Fronteras – which organized a similar, though much smaller caravan in April – are accompanying the migrants. But its staff deny any involvement in convening the current caravan. Members of the caravan say that there is no single organizer. What challenges will the migrants face? Red Cross paramedics are treating the marchers for blisters, dehydration and other maladies aggravated by physical exertion in hot and humid conditions. Temperatures in Chiapas have hovered in the low 30s celsius (around 90F) and show little sign of dropping, despite occasional heavy rains. As it heads north, the group will pass through several zones where violence is rife, and migrants are routinely targeted for extortion or kidnapping. They will also pass through towns which were devastated in last year’s earthquake. For now, Mexican police appear to be letting the migrants pass by unhindered. “Their hands are tied,” Mayor Laparra said, who said that a crackdown was unlikely because the large numbers of reporters and human rights observers travelling with the group. What will happen at the border? Most of the people who make it to the border are likely to turn themselves in to US authorities and claim asylum, although a few – mostly younger men – have said they will attempt to cross illegally if that is not possible. Trump has said he will not let caravan members in, but the US is legally obliged to consider the cases of asylum seekers. If they pass the first step of the asylum process, known as a credible fear interview, they will be held in detention or released in the US and face an immigration court months, but more likely years, later. If they do not pass the screening, or are denied entry to the US on other grounds, they will be deported. The April caravan of 1,500 people had shrunk to a few hundred by the time it reached the border. Of that group, 401 requested asylum, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Of those, 374 passed the credible fear interview, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it was not tracking the outcome of their asylum cases. Another 122 tried to enter illegally, but they too are able to apply for asylum and the outcome of their cases is unknown."
2018-11-25T07:00:00Z,"Will Britain’s beaten, betrayed migrant children find justice at last?","They were sent abroad, often without their parents’ consent. Large numbers were sexually and physically abused, while hunger and neglect were familiar enemies. Their education tended to be poor and they were often forced to perform exhausting manual work. Between the end of the second world war and 1970, successive UK governments allowed thousands of children, almost exclusively from deprived backgrounds, to be removed from their families, foster carers and care homes to be sent to institutions or families in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Southern Rhodesia, ostensibly in the belief that they would enjoy a better life. Some 4,000 were sent to Australia, a mass emigration captured in the 2010 film Oranges and Sunshine, which starred Emily Watson as Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham who uncovered the scandal. But for many children, the promised land failed to deliver. Recognition of just how spectacularly the UK had failed them came in 2010 when the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, officially apologised, stating: “We are sorry that instead of caring for them, this country turned its back.” Eight years on, however, victims complain that their betrayal continues. Despite a government-commissioned inquiry recommending the urgent creation of a compensation scheme, there has been little sign of action, they say. Their lawyers are now taking the first steps in a high court challenge to obtain redress, a legal manoeuvre that threatens to further embarrass a government accused of having failed the Windrush generation. For some, it is likely to be the last chance for justice. “We cannot sit by, waiting for the government to do the right thing,” said Norman Johnston, president of the International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families (IAFCM&amp;F). The action follows the March publication of a report on the children’s experiences by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). Witnesses described “care” regimes which included physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well as neglect. “Some described constant hunger, medical neglect and poor education, the latter of which had, in several instances, lifelong consequences,” the report found. “By any standards of child care, then or at the present time, all of this was wrong.” A former child migrant said his experiences at one school were “better described as torture than abuse”, and recounted how he was locked in a place known as “the dungeon” without food or water for days. Another told of “backbreaking” work on the construction of a school building. A third spoke of a failure to give him medical care, which resulted in the loss of an eye. In some places, there were persistent beatings, and one witness described how he had tried to kill himself at the age of 12. Michael, who was placed with the Christian Brothers in Perth, Western Australia, where he was raped, abused and starved, told the inquiry he felt abandoned by his country. He recounted how one Brother “organised special punishment days for the boys, during which he would make them watch horses being killed”. The children were so hungry they hunted in bins for scraps and on one occasion roasted a cat to eat. When it published its findings, the IICSA recommended that a redress scheme for all child migrants should start within 12 months – 1 March 2019 at the latest. A similar inquiry in Australia established a redress scheme in little over six months. In July, Jackie Doyle-Price, the mental health and inequalities minister, confirmed the government intended to give a formal response to the recommendations by the summer recess. But the deadline came and went, according to the IAFCM&amp;F, a delay it says has meant some victims will never receive what the UK owes them. “To date, at least 21 former child migrants are known to have passed away without justice since the report was issued,” said Johnston, who was abused at an Australian Christian Brothers’ home. “For them, for those child migrants who gave their painful testimony before the inquiry, and for those of us still waiting, we cannot sit by waiting for the government to do the right thing.” Acting for the association, the law firm Leigh Day has sent a Letter Before Claim to the Department of Health and the Home Office, threatening a high court challenge over the perceived failure to respond to the inquiry’s recommendations. The legal challenge threatens to embarrass the government after accusations it was slow to pay compensation to members of the Windrush generation whose status as British citizens was disputed by the Home Office. “Consecutive governments have let these British citizens down,” said Alison Millar, a partner at Leigh Day. “First as children deported to foreign lands without any safeguards, then as adults left to cope alone with what they had endured and now this government, faced with recommendations from its own inquiry, is letting them down again in their advancing years. Following the shameful delays to establish compensation to help the Windrush generation, this again appears to be a case of putting elderly British citizens at the back of the queue while internal political squabbles take precedence.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “We are carefully considering the findings and recommendations made in the report and will provide a considered response to the inquiry’s recommendations in due course.”"
2018-11-23T13:11:52Z,Home Office 'wrongly tried to deport 300 skilled migrants',"The Home Office has wrongly tried to force at least 300 highly skilled migrants to leave Britain under an immigration rule used in part to tackle terrorists and those judged to be a threat to national security, government figures show. The figures, revealed in a governmental review of its use of the controversial 322(5) provision, also suggest that up to 87 highly skilled migrants – including teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers and IT professionals – have actually been wrongly forced to leave the UK under the terrorism-related legislation. A further 400 people may have been affected. They are largely people who have lived in the UK for a decade or more and have British-born children. Many were given just 14 days to leave and were no longer eligible for a visa to visit the UK or any other country. The Home Office directly identified 56 cases where a formal reconsideration of its decision to make people leave was required. This included 37 cases where “we concluded … that it is appropriate to give the applicant the benefit of any remaining doubt and grant indefinite leave to remain”. But the review also shows 143 cases where people won on appeal in the first-tier tribunal and 101 cases that were won in the upper tribunal, at judicial review. The number of those wrongly affected is likely to be substantially higher as the review only considered cases between January 2015 and May 2018. In addition, the first-tier tribunal has 372 cases outstanding and another 242 cases that could be allowed, which suggests that about a further 400 people could have been wrongly affected. All the victims were denied the right to work, rent property or use the NHS during their appeals. Some chose to leave the UK but many of those who chose to stay and fight their cases were forced into destitution, debt and mental health issues, with some considering suicide, the review found. Children had suffered severe trauma and their parents feared it would have a life-long impact on them. The Home Office has not responded to questions about whether it will provide compensation to those affected by its mistakes, whether those potentially wrongly forced from the UK will have their cases reconsidered, and if so, whether they will be invited back to the UK if it is found they were wrongly expelled. These actions were taken with victims of the Windrush scandal, to which this issue has been repeatedly compared. The Home Office was forced to instigate a review of its use of the controversial paragraph of immigration law after an eight-month campaign by the Guardian that highlighted repeated uses of the power, suggesting it was being used to force migrants to leave the UK after making minor mistakes or legal amendments to their tax records. The review revealed that 65% of Home Office 322(5) decisions were thrown out by the first-tier tribunal while 45% of applicants were successful at judicial review, against an ordinary applicant success rate of 28%. An extra 32% of “complex cases” could be wrongly decided, the review said. It also revealed that across all immigration categories refusal of settlement applications was 5% until mid-2015, when it increased to 52% for tier 1 (general) migrants. Paragraph 322(5) of the rules has been a central reason given for the Home Office’s refusal of those in this group. Paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, which has been condemned as “truly wicked” and “an abuse of power” by MPs and experts, forces migrants to leave the country citing “the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C), character or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national security”. Those affected argue that they made legal amendments to their tax records after discovering mistakes while preparing to apply for indefinite leave to remain. The latest review looked at 1,697 applicants refused under paragraph 322(5). If the numbers of Home Office mistakes remained constant, this would mean up to 87 people have been wrongly forced to leave the UK. Alison Thewliss, the MP for Glasgow Central, who has constituents fighting against removal under 322(5), said the government must offer all those affected a compensation package. She tabled a parliamentary question on Thursday asking whether the cases given the “benefit of the doubt” by the Home Office were those highlighted in the media. “This review proves that the Home Office is overstepping and using paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules inappropriately.” The review found that the most common mistake made by the Home Office was its failure to distinguish between a late submission of tax and an amended tax return. “It’s incredible that the Home Office is employing case workers who don’t have even the most basic tax knowledge,” Thewliss said. Syed Naqvi, the head of the immigration department at ITN solicitors, said the review tried to downplay the real picture behind the use of 322(5). “The Home Office acknowledge in the review that 65% of appeals and 45% of judicial reviews have been successful; however, despite spending a great deal of taxpayers’ money on this self-serving review, they still have the arrogance to claim that there isn’t a systematic problem with their approach in such cases,” he said. “For them to say it’s not a dramatic issue is arrogance. This review is an exercise in them trying to cover their backs while blackening the names of applicants.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “These calculations are purely speculative. The courts agree the Home Office’s use of paragraph 322(5), where the evidence shows applicants have attempted to misrepresent their earnings, is reasonable and to suggest otherwise is misleading. “The immigration rule in question is one for general grounds of refusal and it’s completely wrong to say its primary use is fighting terrorism.” A red bucket and two toy cars Owais Raja, an engineer forced into homelessness by a Home Office error, thought his nightmare was over two months ago when he was finally given his visa as a result of the government review. For almost three years, his young son had been unable to have potentially life-saving treatment for a hole in his heart and his wife had not been able to receive treatment for severe health problems. The family was forced into destitution after wrongly being deemed a security threat over a tax error. Raja had his right to work, rent property and access the NHS wrongly removed from him. After the Home Office admitted it was wrong to try to force Raja to leave the UK under paragraph 322(5), he found work as a lecturer at City College Plymouth. However, he could not return to the course he had been teaching because it had closed after no one with Raja’s expertise could be found to replace him. Despite having a part-time job, Raja cannot rent a property: his history with the Home Office and the years of not being allowed to work mean he cannot pass the necessary credit check or show three months of payslips. “Thanks to the Home Office, we have been homeless since September. The council keep moving us,” he said. “On Friday, we will move into our fourth one-bedroom B&amp;B, where there will be no kitchen or facility for us to even warm our youngest child’s milk.” Three years ago, the family had a modest but comfortable lifestyle. “Now we have just one suitcase and a holdall between us all,” Raja said. “We’ve sold everything we can, because we have no money, and got rid of everything else that doesn’t fit into these two bags..” Raja’s sons have three toys: a red bucket and two toy cars. They have no books or pens, one thin jacket between them, and shoes that are too small and have holes in them. “I look back at the life we led just three years ago and it seems like a dream,” Raja said. “The Home Office have forced us into destitution. It has subjected us all to a trauma that will impact heavily on us for our entire lives. “The Home Office … behaved as if they wanted to destroy us and even though they’ve had to admit they were wrong, they’ve largely succeeded in doing that anyway.”"
2018-06-24T08:57:24Z,EU leaders' migration summit offers lifeline to embattled Merkel,"EU leaders gather for an emergency summit on migration on Sunday, with the aim of shoring up Angela Merkel’s government. The informal “mini-summit”in Brussels is seen as a lifeline for the German chancellor, whose CDU party is involved in a bitter dispute over refugee policy with its conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU. Following a row with Italy about the purpose of the meeting, Merkel is downplaying expectations. “The meeting on Sunday is a consultation and working meeting at which there will be no concluding statement,” she said. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed to go to Brussels only after Merkel abandoned a set of pre-written conclusions. A pre-cooked summit communique that emerged last week angered Conte, who said it neglected the “emergency” of migrant arrivals in Italy. Migration has become a political football in Germany and Italy, despite a sharp drop in the number of arrivals. About 41,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2018, and 960 people are confirmed or suspected to have died, according to the latest data from the International Organisation for Migration. The arrival figures are 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016. The issue has shaken Merkel’s government after the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is also the CSU leader, set a two-week deadline for her to come up with a policy to deal with asylum claimants arriving in Germany from other EU member states. Udo Bullmann, a German Social Democrat MEP, accused the CSU of provoking a crisis to bolster its chances in the state election this autumn. “The Bavarian CSU is doing what they always do when the face a crisis, they are organising a crisis with their sister party,” said Bullmann, the leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament. “They are frightened of losing their absolute majority. They see they are declining in numbers, so they think ‘where is my conflict with Berlin, where is my conflict with Brussels’. But in the real world, games can get out of control.” The summit guest list started with eight countries, but the leadersof 17 member states were expected to attend. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced his country and three other central European states would boycott the meeting, although none was expected or obliged to attend. Marta Foresti, the director of the Overseas Development Institute, said the EU was “in disarray on migration and the probability of reaching EU-wide consensus is at an all-time low”. “With the number of arrivals significantly decreased, but a higher proportion of those migrants dying during their journeys, taking concrete steps to address the reality of migration from Africa to Europe could not be more manageable and at the same time more urgent,” she said."
2018-10-15T22:57:17Z,"'Yes, we can': caravan of 1,600 Honduran migrants crosses Guatemala border","A group of more than 1,600 Honduran migrants who are attempting to reach the US border overland have crossed into with Guatemala – despite warnings that they would be turned away at the border. Singing the Honduran national anthem, praying and chanting, “Yes, we can,” the group, who say they are fleeing violence and poverty, crossed the border on Monday afternoon and headed towards the city of Esquipulas. “We are not criminals, we are migrants,” said Keilin Umana, a pregnant nurse who told the Associated Press that she had fled her home after receiving death threats from gang members. The migrant caravan set off from the city of San Pedro Sula on Friday, the day after the US vice-president, Mike Pence, urged the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home. “Tell your people: don’t put your families at risk by taking the dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United States illegally,” said Pence at a regional security event in Washington DC. The Guatemalan government, which is seeking US support in its controversial attempt to shut down the UN-backed crime fighting force investigating the president and his close allies for corruption, pledged to comply with Pence’s demands and halt the mass migration. In a statement, the country’s Institute of Migration (IGM) condemned the migrant caravan as illegal, and vowed to stop the migrants from crossing its border: “Guatemala does not promote or endorse irregular migration in any forms, [and] therefore rejects movements organized for unlawful purposes which distort human rights, like migration, for their own end.” About 100 Guatemalan police officers met the caravan at the border, but after a tense standoff of about two hours, the migrants began walking again. The migrant caravan has swelled from 160 to 1,600 since setting out last week from San Pedro Sula, which has become one of the world’s most dangerous cities thanks to a toxic combination of gang and state-sponsored violence, corruption and impunity. Jari Dixon, a Honduran congressman, tweeted: “They are not seeking the American dream – they’re fleeing the Honduran nightmare.” The group includes dozens of families with infants and children who hope travelling in numbers will reduce the risk posed by criminal gangs that prey on vulnerable migrants. The passage through Mexico is one of the world’s most perilous migration corridors. This is the second Central American migrant caravan this year. In April, Donald Trump threatened to cut foreign aid after hundreds of people, mainly Hondurans, applied for asylum in the US. Since then, thousands of Central American children have been separated from their parents at the US border as part of an anti-immigration crackdown. But rampant violence and poverty in Central America continues to force people to abandon their homes in search of safety and jobs. Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world, despite official figures that claim a record-breaking drop in murder rates. Two-thirds of Hondurans live in poverty, with remittances accounting for a fifth of the country’s GDP."
2018-12-21T16:54:06Z,"Guardian and Observer charity appeal passes £500,000 in a fortnight","The 2018 Guardian and Observer appeal supporting five charities that helped to bring the Windrush scandal to light has raised more than £500,000 in a fortnight. The charities provide legal assistance, advice, advocacy – and often welfare support – for migrants and UK citizens facing injustice, homelessness and destitution caused by “hostile environment” immigration policies. The total raised so far includes £45,000 pledged by readers during the appeal telethon last Saturday, when journalists including Marina Hyde, Gary Younge, Owen Jones, Polly Toynbee and Katharine Viner were on hand to take donations. The appeal remains open until 6 January. Guardian reader Bela, who arrived in the UK from Kenya with her family in 1968 when she was a child, said her own experiences inspired her to give to donate: “This country welcomed me and now it’s my turn to welcome others.” Arten Llazari, the chief executive of Refugee and Migrant Centre, one of the charities, said: “The success of the appeal is another demonstration of the profound decency of the British public and the way it cares for the vulnerable and marginalised.” The five appeal charities are: Praxis Community Projects; Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI); Refugee and Migrant Centre Black Country and Birmingham (RMC); the Runnymede Trust; and Law Centres Network. Many individuals whose heartbreaking stories were revealed by the Guardian’s award-winning coverage of the Windrush scandal were supported directly by our charities. Their work ensured clients were not unjustly deported and detained, and in some cases received the vital NHS treatment wrongly denied to them. According to the charities, the injustices are continuing, despite the government’s acknowledgement of the problems caused to citizens with a Caribbean background. They anticipate similar problems for EU migrants post-Brexit. Satbir Singh, JCWI’s chief executive, said: “I would like to thank everyone for their generous donations. The money raised will help us respond to this crisis by doubling the amount of free legal advice we are able to offer vulnerable individuals and families, reaching out into communities to provide vital support and build the kind of early warning systems that could prevent another Windrush from happening.” Please donate to our appeal here."
2018-12-16T15:51:16Z,Anger grows after death of Guatemalan migrant girl held in US,"The family of the young Guatemalan girl who died in the custody of US border officials after crossing the border is disputing the American government’s claim that she had not had food or water for days beforehand. Anger is growing over the death of Jakelin Caal Maquin, seven, which emerged last week and immediately sparked uproar about harsh immigration and border policies being pursued by the Trump administration. On Saturday, lawyers for the family released a statement insisting that the girl had been fed and hydrated and appeared to be in good health as she travelled through Mexico to the US southern border with her father, intending to seek asylum. She had not been travelling through the desert for days, the family asserted, before being taken into custody by US officials along with many other migrants on 6 December. Jakelin died less than two days later, according to immigration officials. Border patrol officials last Friday said agents did everything they could to save the girl – but that she had not had food or water for days when she began vomiting and eventually stopped breathing, later dying in a Texas hospital. Tekandi Paniagua, the Guatemalan consul based in Del Rio, Texas, said on Saturday that he spoke with Jakelin’s father, Nery Caal. He said Caal told him the group they were travelling with was dropped off in Mexico about a 90-minute walk from the border, and Jakelin had not been deprived of food or water and appeared to be in good condition. Border patrol officials did not immediately respond to the family’s comments. The family’s statement was released on Saturday during a news conference in El Paso, Texas, at an immigrant shelter where Jakelin’s father is staying. Her family did not attend and has asked for privacy. What is known is that in the evening of 6 December seven-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin was picked up by American border officials after crossing a remote part of the US-Mexico border with her father and 161 other asylum seekers. She would have been exhausted, perhaps already running a fever, when she got to a tiny outpost called Forward Operating Base Bounds. The Guatemalan pair had barely eaten or had anything to drink for several days, her father later told officials. However, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials signed her off as in good health, and left Jakelin and her father Nery Caal waiting nearly eight hours for a bus to take them to a larger centre. Before they boarded the bus in the early hours of the morning, her father told officials that his daughter was sick and vomiting; by the time they arrived an hour and a half later her breathing had stopped. A helicopter rushed her from New Mexico to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, but treatment came too late and she died 27 hours after entering the US. “The initial indication from the Providence Hospital is that she passed due to sepsis shock,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that was posted more than a week later. The death of such a young child in custody has caused national outrage, and led to calls for an investigation from Democrats. “A seven-year-old girl should not be dying of dehydration and shock in Customs and Border Protection custody,” said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. He demanded that the Department of Homeland Security and its leader, secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, be held accountable. The incoming speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said: “All Americans grieve the tragic death of a young girl whose family sought a future of freedom and safety for her in our country.” Both of New Mexico’s senators and Democratic congressmen and women from the state and neighbouring Texas also demanded an investigation in an open letter. There were also questions about why the CBP commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, did not mention Jakelin’s death when he testified to the Senate judiciary committee on Tuesday that the agency was struggling to deal with the large numbers of families and children crossing the border. The CBP only confirmed that a child had died in response to a Washington Post inquiry on Thursday, nearly a week after Jakelin had died. The White House, CBP and DHS say border agents tried to save her once they were alerted to a problem. But the interview with Caal was in Spanish, while the family’s mother tongue was Q’eqchi’, a Mayan language, the Washington Post reported. The family come from the Alta Verapaz province, a poor area in the country’s north plagued by drug-related violence. Once it was clear she was unwell, agents “did everything in their power to provide emergency medical assistance for Jakelin Caal Maquin immediately after her father told agents of her distress”, McAleenan said in a statement. A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, emphasised the dangers of crossing the border illegally. Cynthia Pompa, the advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union border rights centre, said the number of migrant deaths had increased last year even as the number of border crossings fell. “This tragedy represents the worst possible outcome when people, including children, are held in inhumane conditions. Lack of accountability, and a culture of cruelty within CBP have exacerbated policies that lead to migrant deaths,” she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2018-10-19T19:06:39Z,"Caravan of 3,000 Central American migrants crosses into Mexico","Hundreds of people in a caravan of migrants that crossed from Honduras into Guatemala staged a dramatic bid to breach the Mexican border on Friday, as local governments began preparing to disperse the convoy under pressure from Washington. Migrants poured through Guatemalan border posts in the town of Tecun Uman and on to a bridge leading to Mexico, only to be halted by dozens of Mexican police in riot gear. Mexico’s president sharply rebuked the migrants for the border surge. US president Donald Trump has warned the Central American caravan must be stopped before it reaches the United States, and Honduras and Guatemala said late on Friday they were mobilising to assist the return of Honduran migrants to their homeland. Some migrants violently shook fences at the border and police said a few officers were injured in clashes. A handful of migrants jumped into the Suchiate river below to swim for rafts. Others turned back toward Guatemala. Carrying backpacks and small children, many bedraggled migrants sat down on the bridge. Some said that they had been teargassed. Jose Brian Guerrero, a 24-year-old Honduran traveling with neighbours and his extended family, said he had joined the caravan to escape violent street gangs, and to find work. “There’s nothing for us in our country,” said Guerrero, who used to sell beans in Honduras. On Friday evening, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales for clearance to send civil protection personnel to help the Hondurans and to find transport for those wanting to return. “We’ll continue this operation for as long as is necessary,” Hernandez said in a post on Twitter. Ivys Osorio, 31, said he was trying to return to Houston, where he lived for 16 years before he was deported in 2016 – and where his wife still lives. “I thought they weren’t going to let us cross – but now I feel getting closer to her,” he said. An army helicopter hovered on the northern bank of the river, some at the front crowd clashed with a line of Mexican police with riot shields, who fired pepper spray at the migrants. A few dozen migrants managed to push past, but most of the crowd formed lines on the bridge as they waited to be processed by Mexican migration officials. The dramatic scenes came a week after a group of migrants set out from the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, to escape crushing poverty and the violence which has turned their country into one of the most dangerous nations in the world. The exhausted marchers had spent the night under rainy skies on the streets and in a park in the border town of Tecún Umán, where the shelter for migrants and a local Catholic parish were filled to capacity. Few were aware of Trump’s attempts to deter the caravan with threats to cut aid payments and deploy troops on the US border. “I think he’s just trying to scare people,” said Heidy Bonilla, 19, rocking her six-month old son, Jeyden. Bonilla had joined the caravan with her mother Mayra, 52; both women were – like many female migrants – trying to escape domestic violence. “God has the final word – only he can decide what happens next.” What awaited them across the border was uncertain. Mexico’s government has said only migrants with the proper papers will be allowed entry into the country, although anyone wishing to seek asylum was free to do so. In Tecún Umán on Friday morning, representatives from the UN refugee agency were handing out leaflets explaining how to claim refugee status in Mexico. Mexico received 14,596 claims in 2017 – more than a six-fold increase from 2014 – but half of the claims made last year are still unresolved, prompting the National Human Rights Commission to warn of the “pending collapse of the refugee protection system in Mexico”. Mexico appeared to be attempting to avoid a rerun of a previous caravan of migrants, which formed over Easter and swelled in size, capturing the attention of conservative US media – and Trump. One of that caravan’s organisers, Irineo Mujica, a dual US-Mexican citizen, was arrested during a peaceful protest on Thursday. Video on social media showed him being stuffed into an immigration institute van as protesters resisted. Late on Thursday, Trump retweeted a video of Mexican federal police arriving at the Guatemalan border and wrote: “Thank you Mexico, we look forward to working with you!” But for many in the caravan, Trump’s hostility seemed illogical. “Latinos are the base of the USA; he needs people like us,” said Carlos Orellana, 23, who said he was heading north in search of employment as a welder. Illegal immigration to the US from Mexico is much lower than in the early 2000s, but growing numbers of families are fleeing the “northern triangle” of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to escape poverty, violence and the early effects of climate change. Omar, 48, was travelling with his 17-year-old daughter who didn’t want to be named because they were fleeing threats and extortion by one of the many street gangs that dominate the region. He was scornful at Trump’s threat to withhold aid to the Honduran government of President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was re-elected in December amid allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Like many Hondurans, Caballeros blames the US for supporting the 2009 military coup against the country’s elected government. “They destabilise our country, wreck our economy, and protect the corrupt, who keep all the money the US sends. We don’t care if they stop the aid – we never see any of it,” he said. Caballeros ran his hand through his white hair, then wiped tears of anger from his face. “All we want is to get out of that hell we were living in San Pedro [Sula],” he said. • This article was amended on 24 October 2018 to remove some personal details."
2018-10-19T15:36:31Z,Trump baselessly claims Democrats are behind migrant caravan,"Donald Trump thrust a caravan of migrants heading toward the US border into the midterm election campaign, saying at a rally on Thursday night that the race will be “an election of the caravan”. A group that now numbers about 3,000 people has left Honduras and has reached Guatemala’s border with Mexico, with the ultimate goal of reaching the US – infuriating Trump. “It’s going to be an election of the caravan. You know what I’m talking about,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Missoula, Montana, declaring his intention to use the migrants’ journey as a bludgeon against Democratic candidates. There is evidence that Trump’s use of the caravan as a campaign issue may be effective among the Republican base. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 75% of voters who intend to vote for a Republican congressional candidate consider illegal immigration a “very big” problem for the country. That makes it the top-rated issue for Republican leaning voters. By contrast, only 19% of voters supporting a Democrat called illegal immigration a very big problem. Democratic voters instead called gun violence, the affordability of healthcare and college education, government ethics, the gap between the rich and poor, and a host of other issues very big problems. Trump claimed, without any supporting evidence, that Democrats were behind the caravan, and raised conspiracy theories that the Central Americans had been paid to come to the United States for political reasons. “Now we’re starting to find out – and I won’t say it 100%, I’ll put a little tiny question mark at the end. But we’re probably not going to need it, but we have the fake news back there,” he told the crowd, adding a familiar jab at news reporters covering his campaign appearances. “A lot of money’s been passing through people to come up and try to get to the border by election day, because they think that’s a negative for us. Number one, they’re being stopped. And number two, regardless, that’s our issue.” Trump appeared to be referring to a video posted by the Florida representative Matt Gaetz, which he claimed showed women and children being given cash to “storm the US border @ election time”. He suggested without evidence that the source could be “Soros? US-backed NGOs?” referring to George Soros, an American billionaire who is the frequent subject of rightwing conspiracy theories. A journalist who interviewed people on the ground where the video was taken reported that local merchants had collected money and given it out as aid to migrants. He located the site in Guatemala, not Honduras as the congressman had claimed. Gaetz later posted a tacit correction, saying he had believed the video was taken in Honduras because it was sent to him by a Honduran official. Speaking of Democrats, Trump said: “They wanted that caravan. And there are those who say that caravan didn’t just happen. It didn’t just happen.” Trump threatened on Thursday to close the US-Mexico border and deploy the military if caravan members approach the frontier. The Mexican government said it was in touch with members of the caravan, some of whom have arrived at the country’s southern border seeking refuge, and will process any legitimate claims for entry in an orderly manner. Mexican officials have said that anyone who enters illegally will be subject to deportation. Despite the extremist campaign trail rhetoric, the Trump administration has supported a Mexican government plan to work with the United Nations refugee agency to deal with the caravan, USA Today reported. The Mexican government plans to ask the UN high commissioner for refugees for help identifying legitimate asylum claims from migrants in the group. Those whose claims are rejected will be deported to their home countries. The Illinois representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat, slammed Trump’s stance on the caravan, as well as his support for the Honduran president’s regime, which she said has worsened already dire conditions in the country. “These people have faced the worst of the worst – gang violence, economic desperation, natural disasters, extreme poverty and in some cases, state-sanctioned violence and intimidation,” she said. “President Juan Orlando Hernández’s corrupt government has made what was already an uphill climb for impoverished Hondurans impossibly steep. President Trump and the state department have supported his government every step of the way, even going against the will of the Organization of American States to legitimize his illegitimate election.” Schakowsky continued: “Instead of admitting some responsibility in creating the violent situation in Honduras, President Trump is yet again scapegoating immigrants and refugees. He is painting a picture of this migrant caravan as a threat to our national security instead of the desperate group of refugees that they are.”"
2018-12-18T14:42:28Z,Greek police accused of beating migrants trying to enter from Turkey,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) has released footage of men bearing prominent scars on their backs as it accused Greek police of inflicting beatings on migrants and asylum seekers illicitly entering the country across the land border from Turkey. The US-based group said the injuries depicted in the footage, shot in Edirne in Turkey in August, were sustained during attacks by Greek police engaged in alleged “pushbacks” of people in the north-eastern Evros region. Masked men wearing uniforms with no identifiable insignia had participated in the abuse, according to HRW. Separately, asylum seekers interviewed in Greece and Turkey described how they were stripped of their clothes and shoes and forced back across the frontier in freezing temperatures at night, often in little more than their underwear. Women, including a pregnant 19-year-old from Syria’s Afrin region, were among those forcibly returned to Turkey, it was revealed. “People who have not committed a crime are detained, beaten, and thrown out of Greece without any consideration for their rights or safety,” said the group’s Europe researcher, Todor Gardos. “The Greek authorities should immediately investigate the repeated allegations of illegal pushbacks.” There was no immediate comment from Greek police or government officials, although accusations of summary returns have been vehemently rejected in the past. But the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) supported the claims of systematic pushbacks, saying it was deeply concerned by them. “We continue to receive a significant number of credible reports of informal forced returns to Turkey through the Evros region,” said Leo Dobbs, the agency’s spokesman in Athens. “Such reports are of deep concern to UNHCR. We have on many occasions shared these concerns with the Greek authorities and urged investigation of incidents and measures to prevent this.” The state’s response, he said, had failed to ensure effective access to asylum and protection from forced returns of those who needed it most. International organisations have recorded an abrupt surge in numbers crossing the heavily militarised land border. The EU border agency, Frontex, estimates arrivals rose by 203% in the region between January and October. For the first time ever, land crossings exceeded sea crossings to Aegean islands in April, when 3,600 crossed the fast-flowing Evros River as entries peaked. Most making the treacherous journey are Turks claiming political persecution at home. However, HRW said its findings were based on interviews with people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia and Yemen. As winter has set in there have been reports of people dying of hypothermia as they attempt to make the crossings in Evros. Unlike Aegean islands, the land border is not affected by the controversial accord agreed in March 2016 between the EU and Turkey in a bid to staunch what were then massive flows into the bloc. Once in Greece, asylum seekers are able to move freely around the mainland, in sharp contrast to the islands where they are forced to remain often in deplorable conditions. HRW said it had put its findings to the Hellenic police director, Georgios Kossioris, who had not only categorically denied the pushbacks, but pledged that any incidents of misconduct, or violation of migrants’ and asylum seekers’ rights, would be thoroughly investigated."
2018-11-09T09:00:10Z,Caravan forces Mexico to confront mixed feelings on migration,"As caravans of Central American migrants wind their way through Mexico’s poorest regions, local people of modest means have headed to the highway with plates of food, plastic bags filled with water and donations of spare clothes. Meanwhile, more affluent Mexicans have complained on social media about the foreigners from poorer countries, often in terms similar to those used by US rightwingers. The caravans have brought out the best in many, but they have also exposed a vein of latent xenophobia – and raised uncomfortable questions about Mexico’s own relationship with migration. Mexicans have often ignored Central America, instead focusing on the US, and sizable numbers of wealthier (and whiter) Spanish and North American citizens find it relatively easy to move to Mexico for work or retirement. “For us, an immigrant is [someone] from a rich country. A migrant someone coming from a poor country,” said Javier Urbano, a professor studying immigration at the Ibero-American University. The most recent census in 2010 showed that less than 1% of the population was foreign born – compared to 13.7% of the population in the United States, according to the Census Bureau. Most of the foreign-born population – excluding dual-citizen children – was from the United States, Canada and other developed countries. “It’s a class issue: [wealthy immigrants] come from countries, which are supposedly examples of development, which in our imagination we want to be” he said. Long a transit country for Central Americans trying to reach the US, Mexico has increasingly become a destination, as violence, poverty and climate change provoke an outflow from the northern triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Mexico received 14,596 asylum claims in 2017, a tenfold increase from 2013 and a figure projected to jump substantially this year. But the government body responsible for processing refugee claims is still short-staffed and underfunded. “Central American immigration has mostly been transitory, so Mexicans never looked at it as a controversial issue,” Urbano said. “Now that [the migrants] are staying, the public debate is starting.” In the face of Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric about Mexicans, defending the country’s citizens north of the border has become a corner of Mexico’s political discourse. But since 2014, Mexico has taken increasingly punitive efforts to stop irregular migration across its own southern frontier. A crackdown launched by outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto and coordinated with the US tightened controls across the south of the country, forcing migrants to take ever-more circuitous – and dangerous – routes north. That policy led indirectly to the current situation: instead of keeping to the shadows, migrants instead grouped together in caravans, hoping the increased visibility would help protect them. Last month, Peña Nieto has softened his stance, offering temporary work visas along with benefits such as healthcare and education. Incoming president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who takes office on 1 December, has also said he will offer work visas and fund job creation in southern Mexico and Central America. But caravan participants have mostly rejected the offer, preferring to risk an uncertain outcome at the US border. And such policies are not universally popular. “We have don’t enough jobs here and the president wants to offer work visas!” exclaimed taxi driver Jorge Luis Meza – who himself worked irregularly in the United States for several years. One opinion poll showed that 61% of rural Mexicans supported the caravan migrants, compared to 49.2% of urban dwellers – whose incomes are generally higher than those in the countryside. But a initial outpouring of support seems to have reduced as more caravans have headed north, said Heyman Vázquez, parish priest in the town of Huixtla which has become a way station for migrants moving north from Guatemala. “We don’t have any more money,” he said. Some good Samaritans admit misgivings at news of the caravan’s arrival, but said they changed their attitudes when they saw entire families slogging along the highway. “I was worried. I heard they were bad people, but then I saw the kids,” said Zuri Flores, 22, who on a recent afternoon was handing out sandwiches and plastic cups of Coca-Cola to weary caravan participants. “We don’t have much. But we’re sharing what we can.”"
2020-01-01T12:00:03Z,The refugee ‘crisis’ showed Europe’s worst side to the world | Hsiao-Hung Pai,"Over the last decade, migration has become an urgent political issue. The 2010s have been marked not only by the global movement of people across national borders but also attempts by governments to erect walls and fences in their path. We’ve seen nationalism winning votes and the worldview of the far right mainstreamed. “Flow”, “flood” and “crisis”. Media imagery and language has shaped public opinion. Of course, migration from the global south to the north – intimately connected to the legacy of colonialism and the west’s military machinations – has been happening for decades. But the 2010s has seen a higher number of people from the south moving towards the north. In particular, Europe has seen hundreds of thousands of people from Africa, the Middle East and south Asia, fleeing chronic poverty, political instability, wars, and the climate crisis in countries often laid to ruin by western-backed institutions. Libya had always been the migratory destination for many sub-Saharan Africans because of its employment opportunities. Following the suppression of the 2011 Arab spring and Nato’s intervention in Libya, a lawless society emerged, with racial hatred against sub-Saharan Africans unleashed. Many escaped forced labour and torture, climbed into dinghies and began the dangerous sea journey across the central Mediterranean. But when they landed in Europe, they didn’t come to safety. Instead, they found themselves in the centre of a white, Eurocentric discourse – a “problem” to be blamed for society’s ills. Throughout this time, when tens of thousands died at sea trying to reach Europe, Europe has imagined itself to be the victim of a migrant or refugee “crisis”. The concept of a “crisis” caused by the movement of people into the European continent has always been embedded in the Eurocentric way of seeing things. This rupture brought about by the arrival of the “other” creates anxiety and fear in the European mind, as the sociologist Encarnación Gutiérrez Rodríguez has pointed out – thus the need to create neverending irrational, ideological justifications for that anxiety and fear. This can be seen in the way migration into Europe has been portrayed as an “invasion” of different cultures and a “clash of civilisations” – in a way that is similar to the justifications of the colonial era where the colonised were cast as racially inferior beings. Colonialism still casts its shadow over the immigration debate. For Europe, the “other” challenges its “way of being” as its presence is a reflection of Europe’s past imperialism, upon which much of the continent’s wealth was built. In the past decade, we’ve seen anti-migrant policies and racism flourish across the world. The EU implemented the hotspot system, filtering people and categorising them as asylum seekers or “economic migrants”. Europe’s patrolling of its southern borders intensified, resulting in deals with Turkey and Libya. Since Italy’s then-interior minister Marco Minniti’s agreement with Libya in 2017, Italy has supplied technical support to the Libyan coastguard, fending Africans away from European waters. Restrictions were also imposed on NGO search-and-rescue activity in the Mediterranean. These policies under the centre-left Democratic party (PD) were later continued and elaborated on by the hard-right Matteo Salvini of the League from the summer of 2018 – and now carry on under the PD/Five Star coalition. Thousands have died as a result. Back in the 1970s, the critic and writer John Berger depicted Turkish migration to Germany in A Seventh Man, which charted migrant workers’ journeys in Europe through their departure, work and return. The “return” represented the future, where a worker could travel freely and see lives improved for his family when he visited home. But in the 2010s, this cycle has been disrupted – many migrants’ and asylum seekers’ irregular status prevent them from visiting home. Instead, they are forced to live invisible lives, illegalised, entrapped and segregated. In Britain, the Conservative government has persistently refused to receive refugees – only 3% of asylum applications in Europe are lodged in Britain because refugees are commonly denied entry. In 2016, when the refugee numbers were at their highest across the continent, Britain only received 38,517 applications for asylum, compared with 722,370 applications in Germany, 123,432 in Italy and 85,244 in France. Britain, simply put, has one of the lowest refugee acceptance rates in Europe. Plenty of efforts have also been made – see the Home Office’s “hostile environment” – to make life unbearable for asylum seekers and migrants in Britain. Over the decade, I have witnessed asylum seekers leading a subhuman existence, deprived of rights to work (despite the substandard state support) and made to pay for healthcare. They live in desperate limbo, pushed into the world of exploitation and forced labour. As a Chinese builder said to me: “If you didn’t die in the back of a lorry, you could die working here.” And there are many migrants who are effectively imprisoned. Throughout this decade, I have visited many people detained in Dover and Yarl’s Wood removal centres, held without time limit, and despite committing no crime. Today, Britain remains the only European country to practice the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and migrants. Over this Christmas, 1,826 people were incarcerated in these centres. While large numbers of people across the globe continue to be denied freedom of movement and illegalised, their determination to survive will not be defeated by walls and borders. Migrant protest movements such as the black vests (gilets noirs) in France and the black sardines (sardine nere) in Italy show that there is plenty of resolve and a willingness to fight back. We can join them by fighting for the regularisation of people’s immigration status – but also by challenging the system that enables their marginalisation and racial segregation. We must offer a different way of seeing migration; a real alternative that addresses colonialism and the massively unequal world that it has created. • Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and the author of Chinese Whispers: The Story Behind Britain’s Hidden Army of Labour"
2019-11-30T19:00:43Z,"When refugees in Libya are being starved, Europe’s plan is working | Kenan Malik","A hospital that finds its patients so burdensome that it denies them medical care. A homeless hostel that turfs its residents out on the streets. A refugee agency that refuses to provide food for those under its care. All might seem implausible. Except that there are credible reports that the third scenario is playing out in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a body that, as its name suggests, is entrusted with the care and protection of refugees. Yet it is apparently trying to shut down a centre that it opened just last year, and to “starve out” the people still inside to force them to leave. The UNHCR’s actions, if the reports are true, are scandalous. They are also unsurprising. Starving refugees out of a place of safety is a fair metaphor for western policy towards unwanted migrants. The EU, in particular, has been adept at using suffering as a policy lever. Central to the EU’s strategy over the past decade has been the outsourcing of immigration control, paying countries from Libya to Sudan, from Niger to Turkey, to deter potential migrants to Europe. In this process a new form of imperialism is emerging, whereby rich nations, in the name of protecting their borders from migrants, trample all over the borders of poorer neighbours. Niger, on the southern edge of the Sahara, is now, in the words of one European ambassador, “the southern border of Europe”. Whereas immigration controls are usually about stopping people entering a country illegally, the new imperialism requires African nations to prevent people leaving their territory if they might be coming to Europe. It’s the 21st century’s version of the Berlin Wall slung across the African continent. What is really being outsourced, as Mali’s former presidential candidate Aminata Traoré observes, is “violence and instability”. Europe has turned migrants into commodities to be haggled over in a brutal new marketplace. It presents its policies as “a response to criminality”, a recent report on EU strategy notes, but in reality it is “fuelling predatory and criminal behaviour by generating perverse incentives in ‘partner’ countries”. The EU does not particularly care who its “partners” are, so long as they willing to stop migrants reaching the Mediterranean. Sudan’s former president, Omar al-Bashir, overthrown in a military coup this year, has been indicted by the international criminal court for war crimes in Darfur. His regime was part of the “Khartoum process”, an EU initiative to cut off the migrant route from the Horn of Africa. One of the most effective instruments in policing migrants is Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries. Until 2013 they were known as the Janjaweed, a vicious militia that pursued almost genocidal violence in Darfur. Earlier this year, the RSF was responsible for massacres against anti-government protesters in Khartoum. It also plies its trade on behalf of the EU. Nor does the EU particularly worry about whom its “partners” lock up, so long as they lock up potential migrants to Europe. In the Sahel, 80% of migration is not to Europe but is regional, involving people who for decades have moved around an area in which borders are naturally porous. Militias and security forces don’t care to sift through different kinds of migrants, so all become targets for the new kidnap and detention industry. The result is the disruption of traditional trade routes, growing economic instability and rising discontent – feeding the desire for migration. The EU turns a blind eye to the treatment of detainees, too. European governments are not just aware of the torture, sexual abuse and extortion to which detainees are subject but also, in the words of Amnesty International’s John Dalhuisen, “complicit in these abuses”. The whole point of outsourcing is to pay others to do Europe’s dirty work. The more hostile the climate for migrants in countries such as Libya or Niger, the more effective the policy of keeping migrants away from Europe. The consequences of EU migration policy should, as the charity Médecins Sans Frontières puts it, “shock the collective conscience of Europe’s citizens and elected leaders”. Yet it is barely discussed. For those hostile to immigration, it’s a price worth paying. For liberals, it’s a touchy issue, for they fear feeding hostility to the EU. For Brussels, the policy is a political success. For dictators and warlords, it’s a means to riches and power. And so, the biggest scandal of our time has become an outrage that dare not speak its name. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
2019-11-28T07:00:31Z,Refugees being 'starved out' of UN facility in Tripoli,"The UN has been accused of trying to starve out refugees and asylum seekers who are sheltering for safety inside a centre run by the UN refugee agency in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. One group of about 400 people, who came to the Tripoli gathering and departure facility in October from Abu Salim detention centre in the south of the country, have apparently been without food for weeks. Among them are 100 minors, according to a recent assessment by the International Organization for Migration. They are “currently starving” apart from some food that other refugees manage to sneak out of another part of the centre, the IOM assessment said. They last received food assistance a “couple of weeks ago”. Internal documents seen by the Guardian show that the UNHCR is also planning to withdraw food from 600 other refugees and migrants in the centre – who include survivors of bombings, torture, forced labour and other human rights abuses. The majority have already tried to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, but were returned to Libya by the EU-backed Libyan coastguard. In a document circulated among UN staff on Tuesday, and seen by the Guardian, the agency said it would “phase out” food catering from 31 December. The document said the information should not be made public before mid-December, when 230 more refugees have been evacuated to other countries, in order to prevent disruption. After that, the facility will no longer be used as a transit centre, the document said, until the remaining refugees and migrants “vacate voluntarily”. In the document, the UNHCR said that it would continue to finance cleaning in the centre after the withdrawal of food, partly to “prevent the reputational risk of having deficient/broken toilets and showers”. It also said a healthcare clinic on the site would continue to operate. An aid worker with knowledge of the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “They are starving the population inside the [facility]. They’re just trying to starve them to motivate them to leave. It’s deliberately withholding aid to put people under pressure.” The group who will be affected by the next food withdrawal include 400 survivors of the 3 July Tajoura detention centre bombing, in which at least 53 refugees and migrants were killed after an airstrike hit the hall in which they were being held. Hundreds of survivors remained on the site of the strike for a week afterwards, staging a hunger strike in protest at the lack of help. They eventually walked dozens of miles to the gathering and departure facility, where they were let in but told their cases for evacuation wouldn’t be evaluated until they agreed to leave the centre. One Tajoura survivor told the Guardian this week that if they are forced to leave and fend for themselves in Tripoli “it will be a very dangerous scenario”. Refugees are frightened of forced recruitment by militias, being caught up in the ongoing civil war, or being kidnapped anew by traffickers. Others who have taken a UNHCR offer of money, in return for living alone in Tripoli, say the payments are not enough and they remain in danger. One Eritrean man recently released from Triq al Sikka detention centre was shot last week by men in police uniforms who, he said, were trying to rob him. “Still now they didn’t give food. I think it is [on] purpose?” an Eritrean refugee in the facility messaged the Guardian this week through WhatsApp. “Everyone is suffering and stressed and we have all decided to stay here until they use force, because being returned to a detention centre means again facing trafficking, torture and abuse.” The man said he spent more than a year in Abu Salim detention centre, which was repeatedly caught on the frontlines of Tripoli’s ongoing conflict. “[We have] no option until UNHCR gives us a positive response. Even if they leave we will stay here. We have no option, we will not go anywhere. There are no safe places in Libya at this time.” An 11 November email sent by the Guardian to UNHCR spokespeople, which asked whether denying food to former Abu Salim detainees in the facility was a “deliberate policy on UNHCR’s part”, went unanswered, as did further requests for comment. The internal UN document suggest that, after the agency stops using the facility as a transit centre, the property could continue to operate as an “open centre” for refugees and migrants previously held in detention centres, though there are other “possible scenarios”. These include that Libya’s department for combating illegal migration (DCIM) “moves in and forcibly removes all the migrants/asylum-seekers … [to] detention centres”, or that it turns the facility into a detention centre run by its own guards. The DCIM, which is under the interior ministry of the UN-backed Tripoli Government of National Accord, ostensibly runs a network of migrant detention centres in Libya, though in reality most are run by militias. A litany of human rights abuses, including rape and sexual abuse, labour exploitation and a denial of medical care have been reported. The UN-run facility opened in December last year to much fanfare. “The opening of this centre, in very difficult circumstances, has the potential to save lives,” said the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi. “It offers immediate protection and safety for vulnerable refugees in need of urgent evacuation, and is an alternative to detention for hundreds of refugees currently trapped in Libya.”"
2019-11-20T12:47:55Z,Greece to replace island refugee camps with 'detention centres',"Greece has announced plans to close its three largest migrant camps and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners have likened to detention centres. People living in overcrowded camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos will be moved to closed complexes for identification, relocation and deportation with a capacity of at least 5,000 people each. More than 27,000 people are currently housed on the three islands – which have a nominal capacity of just 4,500 – under conditions that have been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe. “Decongesting the islands is a priority at this stage,” said Alkiviadis Stefanis, Greece’s deputy defence minister. Smaller camps on the islands of Kos and Leros will be remodelled along similar lines and enlarged, Stefanis added. The changes come with winter approaching and hundreds of families sleeping in tents outside official facilities on the five islands. Asylum seekers will not be allowed to move freely in and out of the camps, said officials, but will instead be locked up until they are either granted refugee status and relocated to the mainland or rejected and sent back to Turkey. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum-seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. The new conservative government, which came to power in July, has already passed a law stiffening asylum requirements for migrants, and has pledged to deploy additional border patrols. Stefanis said the operations of NGO groups that assist migrants would be subject to new criteria. “Only those (NGOs) that meet the requirements will stay and continue to operate in the country,” said Stefanis. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, this week accused the EU of treating countries on the bloc’s external frontiers as convenient places to park migrants. “It cannot go on like this,” Mitsotakis told the German newspaper Handelsblatt. “Europe regards arrival countries such as Greece as a convenient parking spot for refugees and migrants. Is that European solidarity? No. I will no longer accept this.” The International Organization for Migration last month said that Greece’s mainland camps are already nearly full or past capacity."
2019-10-21T05:00:35Z,'When home won't let you stay': artwork addressing global migration,"“You only run for the border when you see the whole city running as well,” writes Warsan Shire, a Somali-British poet in her poem, Home. Another line from the poem, “When home won’t let you stay,” is the title of a new exhibition opening 23 October at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Featuring 40 artworks created by 20 key artists, When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art looks at how displacement, migration and immigration has inspired the works of artists over the past 20 years. The pieces tell some of the stories of the 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency statistic. “This isn’t a survey on the complicated topic of migration, displacement and immigration of people,” said co-curator Eva Respini. “Instead, we wanted to have a focused look through this moment right now. It’s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.” The first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It’s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled; from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes. “Over the years, I’ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,” said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. “Even though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,” she adds. The Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it’s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls “a memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee”. The Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots. Also on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016. The Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. “It tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,” said Respini. One of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. “The site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,” said Erickson. The Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003. Today, this part of the Mediterranean sea, the Strait of Gibraltar is the route to the south of Spain’s Andalusia region, which sees more migrant arrivals than anywhere else in Europe, making it especially timely. The Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra is showing works from her Almerisa series, which sees her photographing a Bosnian refugee woman over the course of 14 years, first as a child, and now as a mother. There’s also a new site-specific, community project by the Boston-based artist Anthony Romero, who collaborated with the immigrant community in east Boston. “He did a series of listening sessions, which are immigration stories,” said Erickson. “These audio recordings are a kind of community archiving for east Boston residents, story sharing.” It’s no coincidence that the museum overlooks the Boston harbor, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s a big theme that comes out of our desire to think about our museum site-specifically,” said Respini. “We’re perched on the Boston harbor, and everyone who visits us can see a dramatic view on top of the water. We’re dealing with perilous crossings over sea, a middle passage, we thought it felt right for our building, it’s so prevalent today.” When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art is on show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston from 23 October to 26 January"
2019-11-25T05:00:43Z,Aid groups condemn Greece over 'prison' camps for migrants,"Greece is poised to create “prison” island camps, say aid groups amid growing criticism of government plans to overhaul refugee reception centres on Aegean outposts facing Turkey. As the UN refugee agency’s top official, Filippo Grandi, prepared this week to fly to Lesbos, where almost 16,000 people are crammed into a single facility, Athens was criticised for adopting legislation in contravention of basic human rights. Disquiet mounted as the centre-right administration, which was elected on a tough law and order platform in July, declared that the country again at the forefront of the migration crisis had “reached its limits”. Announcing measures to tackle a significant increase in arrivals, not seen at such levels since 2015 when nearly a million Syrians entered Europe via the isles, it promised future policies would be defined by deterrence. Under the scheme, closed installations will replace vastly overcrowded, open-air camps; land and sea borders will be reinforced with about 1,200 more guards and extra patrol vessels and deportations stepped up. “We are in the eye of the storm,” said the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, conceding that pressure on Greece to patrol its eastern frontiers had risen dramatically in the wake of Europe’s decision to seal off the nation’s northern borders against migrant flows. “The country needs a national strategy.” With the new structures, which will be built to hold no more than 5,000 people, the era “of shameful scenes” spawned by the deplorable conditions of notorious island camps would, he vowed, finally be replaced “by images of modern, properly functioning installations”. But international aid groups have overwhelmingly condemned the measures. After criticising asylum legislation also passed this month, they predicted the remodelled facilities would only exacerbate the humanitarian disaster unfolding on Europe’s frontiers. Martha Roussou, senior advocacy officer for the International Rescue Committee in Greece, said: “The government’s announcements represent a blatant disregard for human rights. The creation of closed facilities will simply mean that extremely vulnerable people, including children, will be kept in prison-like conditions, without having committed any crime.” The Greek branch of Amnesty International called the plans “outrageous”. Likening Lesbos’s infamous Moria refugee camp to a “human rights black hole”, it said: “In reality, we are talking about the creation of contemporary jails with inhumane consequences for asylum seekers, and more widely, negative consequences for the Aegean islands and their inhabitants.” About 37,000 asylum seekers are trapped on islands that since the summer have been targeted with renewed vigour by traffickers. With Greece being lashed by rainstorms as winter intensifies, groups have increasingly raised the alarm over what many are calling a humanitarian disaster. Officially, reception facilities on Samos, Lesbos, Chios, Kos and Leros have a capacity to accommodate about 5,400 people. The number of men, women and children making the treacherous sea crossing from Turkey has risen by 73% this year, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. It said the vast majority are refugees fleeing persecution and war. The influx marks the biggest jump in arrivals since March 2016 when the EU struck a landmark accord with Ankara to curb flows. The deal, which until this year resulted in the number of arrivals dropping significantly, forced asylum seekers to remain on islands until their claims were cleared. Overwhelmed services are dealing with a backlog of 70,000 asylum requests nationwide. After visiting the camps last week, Médecins Sans Frontières’ international president, Christos Christou, said: “I’ve been truly shocked and devastated by the extent of the emergency. Men, women and children are trapped in endless drama … In Moria on Lesbos there’s one latrine per 200 people. In Samos, one latrine per 300. This human tragedy needs to end now and it can if Greece and Europe choose to enact a responsible migration system and end these containment policies.” With local island communities equally under pressure, Mitsotakis has pledged that by early next year 20,000 people will be transferred to newly built camps on the mainland. Asylum processing is also to be accelerated, with an extra 500 staff hired to vet procedures. On Sunday, Mitsotakis addressed the issue of unaccompanied minors, thought to number more than 4,000. He said special steps would be taken to “close the wound” of youngsters also in Greece. But while those measures are considered long overdue, the government’s plan to replace camps with closed facilities, that will detain asylum seekers alongside those whose claims have been rejected, has faced particular criticism. The UNHCR’s representative in Greece, Philippe Leclerc, told the Guardian he was particularly concerned by the message of deterrence the new policies conveyed. He said: “We need the islands to be decongested for asylum procedures to be processed and so welcome such action. But we don’t see the need for asylum seekers to be kept in closed centres. Most of those coming in are from Afghanistan and Syria. They have the profiles of refugees and are deserving of asylum.” In a nation that had previously exhibited sympathy and compassion towards refugees, attitudes are hardening. In sharp contrast to its leftist predecessor, the Mitsotakis government is determined to stop would-be migrants in their tracks. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas outlined the measures last week: “A clear message should be sent to those planning, or thinking of coming to the country illegally when they aren’t entitled to asylum. They should realise … if they give money to a trafficker to bring them to Greece they will lose it.” With the influx showing no sign of abating – about 643 refugees and migrants were rescued in the Aegean over the last 24 hours – arrivals are outpacing transfers, and the government also faces tough resistance from Greeks. In Chios, Lesbos and on the mainland, the prospect of the new detention centres has been met with anger, with locals staging protests, blockading the arrival of coaches carrying refugees and promising to step up opposition in the months ahead."
2019-11-03T15:15:52Z,Outrage in Calais over death of Nigerian man in tent,"Aid groups have protested over “inhuman” conditions for migrants and refugees sleeping rough in Calais after a 25-year-old Nigerian man died from smoke inhalation in his tent. He had tried to light a fire in a tin to keep warm and prepare food. Police in Pas-de-Calais confirmed that a man had died from intoxication from smoke fumes at the end of last week and said an autopsy would take place. The man was the third migrant or refugee to die in Calais this year. Aid groups reacted angrily and joined leftwing opposition parties in protesting against a recent decree by the rightwing mayor of Calais aimed at stopping migrants from gathering in the town centre during cultural festivities planned for this month. Charities said the decree had limited their ability to distribute food to migrants and refugees sleeping rough. “This death is really symbolic at a time where the local authorities have sought to remove migrants as well as the volunteers who help them from the town centre for supposed reasons of public order,” said François Guennoc of the aid group l’Auberge des Migrants. The decree was signed in part to coincide with a Calais street festival this weekend. Several political parties including the Greens, the Socialist party and France Unbowed said it denied migrants “their humanity and labels them as parasites that have to be hidden or walled in”. Since the closure of a makeshift migrant camp in Calais in October 2016, hundreds of people have been sleeping rough along the coast in squalid conditions, many without proper access to sanitation. Charities estimate that between 400 and 500 migrants and refugees are currently in Calais hoping to cross to the UK. The majority are from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan Antoine Nehr, a coordinator for Utopia 56, which helps migrants and refugees in Calais, said conditions were “disgraceful and inhuman”. “People are being kept in such precarious conditions that unfortunately result in too many deaths,” he said."
2019-11-01T08:44:25Z,Greece passes asylum law aimed at curbing migrant arrivals,"Greece has passed a controversial asylum law aimed at curbing the rising number of migrants arriving on its shores, despite mounting criticism it will curtail fundamental human rights. The 237-page bill, entitled “international protection and other provisions”, has provoked the ire of human rights groups, aid organisations and opposition parties, who claim the law will severely restrict access to safeguards for asylum seekers. They raised objections that the centre-right government had allowed only days to examine proposals that ordinarily would require months to consider. Anger over the legislation, which passed late on Thursday, intensified as a senior European envoy warned that conditions in vastly overcrowded Aegean island facilities had become “explosive”. “The situation of migrants, including asylum seekers, in the Greek island camps has dramatically worsened over the past 12 months,” said Dunja Mijatović, Europe’s commissioner for human rights, after visiting Lesbos and Samos, the islands most affected by the influx from Turkey. “Urgent measures are needed to address the desperate conditions in which thousands of human beings are living.” More than 35,000 men, women and children are stuck on Greek islands facing the Turkish coast, with the vast majority trapped in asylum limbo. Greece is in the midst of the sharpest increase in refugee arrivals since 2015, when more than a million people, mostly from Syria, crossed over from Turkey into Europe via the Aegean isles. The abrupt increase has turned into an unforeseen crisis for the administration of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The three-month-old government, acutely aware of the pressure the surge has placed on communities, has responded by vowing to take a much stricter stance than its leftwing predecessor. Last month it pledged to deport 10,000 migrants by the end of 2020. Under a landmark accord reached between the EU and Ankara in March 2016, asylum seekers whose requests were rejected were told they would be sent back to Turkey. Introducing the legislation in parliament on Thursday, the country’s civil protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, insisted its aim was to accelerate procedures so refugees could be integrated more smoothly into Greek society and returns of migrants whose asylum applications had failed could be expedited. By streamlining unwieldy processes both could be facilitated, he argued. “Time is not on our side,” said the minister, explaining that under the new law asylum requests would be handled within 60 days. “Boats are coming from across the Aegean. And with each passing day ever more come.” Faced with a backlog of 68,000 asylum requests, the system was so strained that claimants were being forced to wait five to six years without receiving any judgment, he said. Mitsotakis told parliament before the vote that the bill was also meant to send a clear message: “Enough is enough, enough with those people who know that they are not entitled to asylum and yet they attempt to cross into and stay in our country,” he said. The government has also promised to decongest the islands by transporting up to 20,000 people to the mainland over the next year. But it also says the problem has been exacerbated by the arrival of thousands of migrants who do not fulfil the criteria of asylum seekers. The assertion elicited fierce rebuke from the main opposition Syriza party. “This is a government that is trying to turn the issue into one of [illegal] migration when the vast majority of incomers come from war zones,” said Giorgos Psychogios, a Syriza MP, in parliament. “It’s the wrong attitude and it is weakening the country internationally.” Human rights defenders fear the law will make it easier for authorities to detain asylum seekers, narrow their right to work and restrict access to international protection for vulnerable people, including unaccompanied children. “The new bill is a naked attempt to block access to protection and increase deportations in the face of the recent increase in arrivals,” said Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Greek government should instead prioritise resolving the humanitarian crisis that the deeply flawed deal with Turkey has caused for asylum seekers,” she added, claiming the law would make it harder for torture victims to be recognised as such. The aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières said the legislation had failed to address the medical needs of thousands of refugees and migrants, reducing their already limited chances of accessing specialised care. This month the United Nations refugee agency expressed concern about the proposed law changes, saying they could weaken the protection of refugees. Opponents say the new regulations will make procedures even more convoluted, exacerbating a logjam likely to get worse if, as looks likely, the increase in arrivals continues. “This law is going to aggravate the system,” said Lefteris Papagiannakis, the former vice-mayor of Athens in charge of migrant and refugee affairs. “We’re going to see a lot more people without documents and a lot more obstacles to access asylum. And that will mean added pressure on services already at breaking point.”"
2019-12-29T17:11:15Z,Most Britons weren’t hostile to migrants | Letters,"Kavita Puri, like so many others before her, talks about the racism faced by immigrant communities when they first arrived in large numbers during the 1960s (They came from south Asia to help build Britain. The racism they saw then is back, 20 December). This does great injustice to the vast majority of British people who went out of their way to help the new migrants to settle. They volunteered to teach English, teachers paid extra attention to immigrant children, health service staff treated the frail and elderly with utmost compassion. As an example, the city of Leicester accommodated tens of thousands of people fleeing Uganda. The Conservative government of Ted Heath did a remarkable job in settling those expelled from Idi Amin’s regime. Employers took in the new arrivals with little grasp of English and let them flourish. A huge number of people from the Indian subcontinent and east Africa ventured into business and prospered. The new generation born in this country have achieved beyond anyone’s imagination. They have broken many glass ceilings. Yes, you will occasionally get abuse thrown at you or there will be disagreeable people in all walks of life, but how can that be representative of the whole country? On the other hand, minorities can also have faults, and it remains their responsibility to join the mainstream. They have to respect the ethos and nuances of the people of the country they find themselves living in. While not denying that there were, and are, issues, the narrative that total hostility prevails does not stand up to scrutiny. Nitin Mehta Croydon, London • It is certainly worthwhile for fans to take a lead on football racism (Letters, 27 December), but if we are serious about getting rid of racism, it is far too late in people’s lives and much more difficult to do this. Racism does not come out of nowhere. Research over 50 years shows it is learned at an early age, long before children go to school. So in our deeply entrenched racist society, unless what surrounds children is positive about taking action to counter this racism, it is likely that they will reflect this. Much of our media, society and education system deny and even ridicule this. Consequently, little is done until it is far too late, when long-held attitudes are much more difficult to unlearn. In football, on the streets and in political discourse, such racism festers. Unless we face the facts about the early age that racism is learned, we’ll continue to have pleas for someone to do something about it when it rears its ugly head.

2019-12-30T08:00:01Z,The child refugees risking the Channel by boat – one year on,"Bridget Chapman, who swims regularly in the Channel, wasn’t surprised when desperate asylum seekers began travelling to the UK on small dinghy boats last year. On a clear day she can see France’s coastline from where she lives in Folkestone, Kent. “If you’re stuck in Calais and you can see the British coast quite clearly, it must be really tempting to think: I’ll just get a boat,” she said. It has been a year since the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, declared the increasing number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel a “major incident”, but boat arrivals are still a regular occurrence. On Boxing Day this year, more than 60 migrants were picked up while attempting to cross in small boats. Since Javid declared the major incident in December 2018, it is estimated that more than 1,800 people, including many children, have crossed the Channel in small boats to the UK, compared with about 300 for the whole of 2018. Chapman, who works for Kent Refugee Action Network (KRAN), which supports unaccompanied minors who arrive in the UK at youth centres in Canterbury and Folkestone, has seen a 50% rise in demand in the past year. The government announced it would be working closely with France to bring the number of boat crossings down, but campaigners say the strategy has failed to deal with the root of the problem. The crackdown on migrants attempting to reach the UK on trains and lorries has resulted in more turning to small boats, while the situation in northern France has compounded people’s need to leave. Maddy Allen, who works for Help Refugees in northern France, said: “The situation has continued to deteriorate. It really is the worst it has ever been. The crossings are taking place alongside large-scale evictions. It’s beyond inhumane, we are calling them makeshift camps, but in reality it’s no shelter.” In September, authorities in Dunkirk evicted more than 700 people, including families and young children, from a temporary migrant camp. These evictions have become a feature of life for migrants in northern France since the dismantling of the so-called Jungle, a refugee camp where about 10,000 migrants lived, three years ago. Many migrants have complained of beatings, regular arrests and the confiscation of their tents and sleeping bags. “It’s unliveable, it’s dangerous, and hostile. What we’re seeing is mass homelessness on a really grim scale,” Allen said. At the same time, the safe routes for seeking asylum in the UK are being tightened. Charities have heavily criticised the government for dropping family reunion rights for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, warning it will leave them with “no options” except to take dangerous routes. While the Home Office has not provided figures on the number of migrant boat crossings that have taken place since last Christmas, a factsheet published in October stated: “Since January, over 100 people who entered the UK illegally on small boats have been returned to Europe.” For those languishing in northern France, the distance between the two countries appears deceptively short. Chapman said: “I swim all year round in the Channel and I know how dangerous it can be. At night, when the air is clear and France is lit up, it looks like it would be a short walk and you would be here. It’s just not that simple in the water: there are strong tides, the water is freezing, and the Channel is the busiest shipping lane in the world.” The journey can take anything from eight to 24 hours, with smugglers cramming 30 people into boats made for six. Yet children as young as 13 continue to make the dangerous boat journey alone. Two unaccompanied minors who did so were among a group of young refugees in a youth centre ran by KRAN at the bottom of a hill in Folkestone. The young asylum seekers spent their morning playing on guitar, painting and watching TV. “People who arrive on boats, in our experience, have got extremely good asylum claims. They want to make themselves known to authorities at the earliest possible opportunity so they can make their claim,” Chapman said. Once asylum seekers are picked up by the authorities, they are first taken to a Home Office building in Dover for a health check and then given an initial screening interview so they can lodge an asylum claim. Adults or families are transferred to a hotel, usually in London, to live on a temporary basis. They are then moved to somewhere in the country where there is capacity and accommodation. Unaccompanied minors have a different journey; they are first moved into a reception centre in Ashford, which Chapman describes as “clean, bright, and warm”. The young asylum seekers get their own room, three meals a day, pocket money, and are assigned social workers. They stay in the reception centre for an average of seven to eight weeks before they are moved to independent living, somewhere in Kent. There are 352 unaccompanied asylum seekers under the age of 18 in Kent, according to KRAN. There are not enough foster families to place all the unaccompanied minors under the care of an adult. This is where KRAN steps in, teaching the young asylum seekers basic life skills such as cooking and budgeting, along with English language lessons. By January 2020, there will be 920 people who arrived as unaccompanied minors in Kent that have since turned 18. Among them is Faisal Hakimi, a 20-year-old refugee from Afghanistan who works as a mentor at the centre. He said: “I try to help by answering their questions about the Home Office and I sometimes help with translation. Mostly, we’re here because they’re feeling really lonely. They’re really young. They’re 13, 14, 15 and it’s really hard.” Another mentor, 25-year-old Amani Arab, said she was lucky to have been granted humanitarian protection that allowed her and her family to fly to the UK from a refugee camp in Lebanon. She has slowly been able to rebuild her life in the UK after fleeing Syria in 2013 and wants to become a cook. “There are many young children here and I want to be able to help them in some way so I often come here to cook meals. It feels amazing how happy I can make them with such a simple act,” she said. Her mother, who often comes to help her, is widely referred to as Mum by the rest of the group. Integration with the local community is key to the work that KRAN does, as the response to boat arrivals from the media and politicians can be alarming and inaccurate. “We did one integration activity with the local primary school where the school selected some young people from families who had negative attitudes towards refugees. The young students were really scared and anxious about the visit, but within about five minutes of being here, with some biscuits and a football, everybody was friends,” Chapman said. Hakimi already has a lot of hometown pride. “Many people say Dover is the worst place in England, but I would say they’re wrong. It’s the best place,” he said. “I feel like I was born in Dover. The people, the sea, the white cliffs – everything about Dover is nice.” When he talks about his favourite meal, fish and chips, Chapman interrupts to tell him: “Jewish refugees introduced fish and chips to this country.”"
2019-10-23T18:21:26Z,Essex lorry deaths: how dangerous is the journey to the UK?,"Where did the 39 people who were found dead in a lorry container come from? We don’t know yet. Police were clear on Wednesday that they were some way from identifying them or confirming their point of origin. The only detail they provided of the victims initially was that 38 were adults and one was a teenager. Throughout the day, information emerged that might provide clues as to where the victims were picked up. Initially police thought that the container had come to the UK via Holyhead on Saturday and said: “We believe the lorry is from Bulgaria.” But later the force said it now believed that the trailer had travelled from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, while the cab had come from Northern Ireland separately. The Bulgarian government said that the lorry was registered in the coastal city of Varna under the name of a female Irish citizen. While it was not clear that either the cabin or the trailer had begun their journey there, the hypothesis that the victims travelled along the Balkan migrant route remained a possibility. Where does Bulgaria sit on the Balkan migrant route? Every day, hundreds of asylum seekers from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran attempt the cross the Balkan route to reach western Europe. The majority of them arrive in Bulgaria, having travelled through Turkey. From there, they try to cross Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, hoping to reach Slovenia, a Schengen country, before heading on to Italy, Austria or Germany. What are conditions like in the Balkans? Migrants often face brutal beatings within Balkan countries and as they cross borders. Setting off in groups, they attempt to cross under cover of night, trying to avoid police, armed with truncheons, pistols and night-vision goggles. If captured, migrants are often illegally pushed back, only to try again the next day. Informal camps are dotted along the Balkan borders, such as the one in Bihać in Bosnia, where migrants sleep in tents or under plastic and cardboard for a few nights. Migrants who have experienced the camps run by the Bulgarian government say asylum seekers are repeatedly abused and assaulted by the police. Since eastern European countries, such as Hungary, have closed their borders, crossings have become increasingly hazardous for migrants. Often, the only way to continue the journey is on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers. What are the recent developments? Last month, the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, drew attention to a significant rise in illegal crossings. Borissov said that on 20 September, 440 migrants had been detained after crossing the Turkish border by 11am alone. Greece is dealing with a similar situation. Meanwhile, local authorities in Bosnia have temporarily cut the water supply in Vucjak camp, near the city of Bihać, to force the central government to relocate migrants and refugees living there. Police have also removed dozens of asylum seekers from trains to prevent them from reaching camps that are overcapacity in the north-west of the country. Thousands of migrants are stuck near the border with Croatia, an EU member state. The Bihać Red Cross has warned of a building humanitarian crisis. How many people have died in transit? Since 2014 the International Organization for Migration has recorded the number of people who have died in transit. In the past six years, figures show more than 33,700 deaths. This figure is considered indicative of the human cost of unsafe migration but is likely to underreport the actual number of people who have died or gone missing during migration. More than 1.9 million migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN. A total of 92 migrant deaths were recorded on land in Europe in 2018, and before Wednesday’s discovery of 39 bodies inside a Bulgarian-registered lorry in Essex, 58 deaths had been recorded for 2019, 22 of which were from “vehicle-related” incidents. Five people have drowned in the Channel this year, and a man who stowed away on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. A further 24 people have died on the western Balkans route so far this year: eight deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina, six in Serbia, five in Croatia, three in North Macedonia and two in Slovenia. There were 41 deaths in 2018."
2019-12-04T15:46:58Z,Grenade thrown at migrant children's centre in Madrid,"Bomb squad officers in Madrid have carried out a controlled explosion after a practice hand grenade was thrown over the wall of a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors in the north-east of the Spanish capital. A spokeswoman at the Madrid headquarters of the national police force said the grenade carried a small amount of explosive. There were no reported injuries. “Staff at the centre found a suspicious object in the centre’s patio between 8.30 and 9 this morning,” she said. “Specialist officers from the national police force attended and evacuated the children to a safe area. Bomb squad officers detonated the object, which was determined to be a practice grenade with little charge, which had been thrown into the centre’s grounds in a bag from outside.” The reception centre, in the Hortaleza neighbourhood, recently made headlines after it was singled out by Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party. Abascal, who lives in Hortaleza, said the centre and its residents – many of whom are from north and sub-Saharan Africa – had left many local people feeling unsafe. “I live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood – Hortaleza,” he said during an election debate last month. “And every time I’m on the street – and there’s a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors there – I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.” Unaccompanied foreign minors – known by the Spanish acronym menas –were also targeted by Rocío Monasterio, Vox’s leader in Madrid, who called them “a serious problem in our neighbourhoods”. Wednesday’s attack was not the first time that children at the centre have been targeted. In the fortnight before the election, on 10 November, some of them were beaten with oars and clubs. Adriana Lastra, the vice-secretary general of the ruling Socialist party, said that words had consequences. “This is what hate speech brings,” she wrote on Twitter. “It needs to be fought online, on the streets and in our institutions.” Vox also condemned the attack. But in a statement, it accused its opponents of trying to make political capital out of Wednesday’s events. “It’s disgraceful that violence – which is never justified – should be used for political ends,” it said. “We await the conclusions of the investigation by state security forces.”"
2019-12-16T07:00:14Z,Greece says it's 'reached  limit' as arrivals of refugees show no sign of slowing,"Sometimes en masse, sometimes alone they keep on arriving: in rickety boats carrying men, women and children looking for a freedom they hope Europe will offer. Despite winter’s limited daylight and whiplash-heavy storms and rains, the number of asylum seekers landing on Greek shores shows no sign of abating. Not since Europe’s historic agreement with Turkey to curb migrant flows at the height of Syria’s civil war in March 2016 have arrivals been so high. In September alone 10,551 newcomers arrived, the highest in a single month since the deal. The renewed surge has placed mounting pressure on a centre-right government that pledged to take a much tougher stance on migration than its predecessor. Since assuming office in July, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has appealed to the EU to exhibit more solidarity towards Greece and other frontline states struggling to cope with ever more refugees and migrants. Latest figures show there are about 40,000 men, women and children on Samos, Lesbos, Chios, Kos and Leros – the five main entry points facing Turkey – mainly accommodated in overcrowded camps designed for 5,400. Despite concerted efforts to decongest the islands, the authorities have only been able to move about 10,000 people to the mainland in recent months. The EU’s new executive body is poised to draft fresh policies on the migration challenge and Athens says it’s crucial that Brussels recognises the need for asylum seekers to be shared equally among member states. Last week, Mitsotakis told the European Commission’s new vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, and home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson – both tasked with overhauling migration and asylum policies – that Greece had “reached its limits” and could no longer handle the influx alone. “This is not a Greek-Turkish problem,” he said as the officials visited Athens. “[It’s] an issue that affects the European Union as a whole and we are looking forward to your help, as well as a firm European policy, to address it.” Targeted by people smugglers, Greece has been at the sharp end of migration flows, hosting close to 90,000 refugees and migrants nationwide – a greater number than the combined total of asylum seekers registered in Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus, according to the UNHCR. Amid growing concerns over the appalling conditions, Brussels has come under pressure to take action. On 12 December, France said it would take in 400 people from Greece, but it is seen as too little, too late. At a time when the EU faces stiff resistance from within its own borders – not least from Visegrád countries led by Hungary – goodwill gestures will do little to distribute the load fairly, Greek officials say. Late last month, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, also called for Europe to do more at a time of growing global displacement due to persecution and war. Using a symbolic trip to Greece, he noted it was clear the compassion with which the nation had greeted over a million Syrians at the height of the crisis was now much “less visible ” – and at risk of running out. “Europe has to get its act together,” he said after visiting Lesbos. “[It] has to have a new system that is based on sharing, responsibility sharing.” Regulations drafted 20 years earlier that required asylum seekers to register in first-entry countries were “completely inadequate now,” he said. Even more worrying was the sheer number of unaccompanied minors arriving, who were most at risk of labour exploitation, sexual exploitation and violence, Grandi warned. “There are more than 5,000 [in Greece] … there is a children on-the-move emergency in this country that needs to be tackled.” Elected on a tough law and order platform, the Mitsotakis government has announced measures aimed squarely at deterrence and deportation of those not entitled to remain in Europe. Among the policies is a controversial plan to replace the sprawling island camps with “closed” detention centres, which human rights groups claim will be tantamount to “prisons”. The new administration has also announced plans to accelerate asylum procedures while relocating up to 20,000 to the mainland from islands. As anti-immigrant rhetoric mounts across the continent, the UN has voiced fears over the prospect of harsh measures being applied to people desperately in need of protection, access to education and health services. “I made it clear to the [Greek] government that UNHCR policy is against detaining asylum seekers … seeking asylum is not a crime,” Grandi insisted, distinguishing between the Greek government’s right to control the process of managing refugees and it pursuing detainment. “We are all in favour of efficiency and speed, but not if this is at the expense of safeguards,” he said. Greece is not alone in recording a jump in arrivals this year. Cyprus has experienced a surge, with most refugees travelling into the partitioned island’s Greek south through the Turkish-occupied north. Cyprus outstrips all other EU states in having the highest number of asylum applications per capita. “At present rates, Cyprus will have 100,000 [refugees and economic migrants] in the next five years,” said Constantinos Petrides, the country’s interior minister until this month. “And, frankly, that estimate is rather modest,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a lot of people for a country the size of Cyprus.” His successor announced this week that Greek Cypriot police and military would be stepping up patrols along the island’s UN-patrolled ceasefire line. Meanwhile Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly threatens “to open the gates” for refugees to Europe. Attitudes in Turkey, where almost four million Syrians are registered, have hardened dramatically this year on the back of economic crisis and spiralling joblessness. With frontline states increasingly viewing the issue of migration as the EU’s single biggest policy failure, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria have formed the Eastern Mediterranean Migration Route Initiative – an alliance that has has also forged ties with Malta and Italy. In a time of record population displacement, and with the bloc riven with division over how to handle the issue, the EU’s new executive promises to devise a common strategy to confront a phenomenon that shows no signs of slowing any time soon."
2019-09-03T08:00:49Z,More Cubans seek asylum in Mexico amid clampdown on legal path to US,"Yatsel Jerez Ramón has been in Mexico for six weeks, and so far, nothing has gone well for the Cuban migrant trying to reach the United States. On his first night in Tenosique, a small city in the southern border state of Tabasco, Jerez, 37, narrowly escaped a police raid at his hotel. The following day, a man posing as a state lawyer convinced him to hand over $500 to obtain a humanitarian visa with which, Jerez was told, he’d be able to safely continue his passage north. Jerez was travelling with several other Cubans, and together they also forked out $2,000 for an amparo – a legal petition used to temporarily suspend deportation if detained by immigration agents. “We arrived blind,” Jerez told the Guardian, “trusted in what people said, but everyone took advantage of us.” Armed with the visa and amparo, Jerez boarded a bus heading north hoping to reach the US border within the week, but didn’t get far. Jerez was detained at the first checkpoint leaving Tenosique after immigration agents who boarded the bus said the visa was fraudulent, and taken to the overcrowded National Migration Institute (INM) detention centre. Here, according to Jerez, he was threatened with prosecution – and eight years in jail – for false documents if he dared apply for asylum, rather than agreeing to deportation. The amparo was proclaimed useless. For Jerez, going back to Havana wasn’t an option: “I just want to continue on my journey to the US. But I’m scared of being deported, so even if it takes months, seeking asylum in Mexico seems like my only option to reach the border.” Jerez is among a rapidly growing number of Cubans turning to the Mexican asylum system amid a clampdown on alternative legal routes. In the first seven months of this year, 4,604 Cubans applied for asylum in Mexico, representing 10% of all applicants. In 2018, 218 Cubans sought asylum, representing 1% of total applicants. Historically, US-bound Cubans encountered far fewer obstacles on the migration passage due to unique legal protections and economic and educational advantages compared with Central Americans. But, a crackdown by the US and Mexican governments has left tens of thousands of Cubans trapped in Mexico, facing the same dangers and hurdles as migrants from elsewhere. In April, Cubans spearheaded a mass escape from one overflowing detention centre in protest at delays and inhumane conditions. The Cubans’ plights can be traced back to Barack Obama’s second term, when reducing migration was a key issue in bilateral discussions that eventually led to the historic diplomatic thaw between the old foes. Mexico was instrumental in implementing this deal to curtail Cuban migration, according to Rodolfo Casillas, a migration scholar at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (Flacso): Mexico detained 14,000 Cubans during 2015 and 2016 as rumours about a change in US policy prompted a surge in Cubans leaving the island. In 2017, just days before leaving the White House, Obama revoked the “wet foot, dry foot” policy which treated all Cubans arriving on US soil as political refugees, authorized to stay and legalize their status. Since then, Cubans have been obliged to enter the backlogged and time-consuming US asylum process like everyone else. Now, the impact of Donald Trump’s policy is hitting Cubans in Mexico: in the north, thousands are waiting in line in border cities like Ciudad Juárez to present their asylum cases at ports of entry. En route, 5,512 Cubans were detained in the first six months of this year, compared with 504 during the whole of 2018. (710 have been deported this year, compared with 156 in 2018.) In the south, in cities like Tenosique and Tapachula, those without the means to pay people smugglers are trapped since the exit pass – which allowed select nationals including Cubans and Haitians to traverse Mexico legally – was revoked in early 2019 amid the threat of crippling trade tariffs by Trump. “The tap has been turned off,” said Ramón Márquez, director of the La72 migrant shelter, where 228 Cubans sought refugee in the first seven months of 2019, compared with 23 in 2019. “Mexico’s only policy objective is to avoid conflict with Trump,” said Casillas from Flacso. “This means stopping the flow of migrants, whatever it takes, which is fuelling people smuggling and asylum cases.” In Tenosique, most Cubans can be found renting cramped, very basic digs, looking for a safe route out of the boiling hot city where violent crimes against migrants have long been tolerated by authorities. Yilesy González, 40, from the city of Cárdenas, sold the family home and left Cuba with her husband in mid-July, leaving behind their two children with her mother. González says that life had become intolerable since 2017, when authorities discovered the makeshift boat they’d built to sail across the Caribbean Sea to Honduras. The couple share an airless rented room with six others on the outskirts of the city, who are all waiting for appointments with the Mexican refugee agency. They don’t have family in the US to help pay for a coyote (guide). “We’d be happy to stay in Mexico, but not here, somewhere with jobs, so we could make a life.” Josep Herreros, a UN refugee agency protection officer in Mexico, said: “The dramatic increase in Cubans seeking asylum reflects changes in migration policies in Mexico, rather than changes in their home country. “There must be safe legal paths to migration, so that asylum is only used by those who need international protection.”"
2019-10-23T17:08:48Z,Lorry horror highlights risks migrants take to try to reach UK,"The discovery of 39 people dead in the back of a lorry in Essex has renewed focus on the risks taken by undocumented migrants to travel to the UK to seek safety and shelter. A lack of safe and legal routes into the UK is in part driving a dependence on life-threatening methods including squeezing into the back of refrigerated lorries or riding in vulnerable dinghies across wild seas. People fleeing the threat of torture, rape or death cannot claim asylum in the UK without physically reaching Britain, aside from a few limited programmes including the Syrian refugee resettlement programme. Family reunion routes – that is, those granted refugee status in the UK being able to apply to bring relatives to join them – have been drastically curtailed. The UK gave protection – grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave and resettlement – to 18,519 people in the year ending June 2019, according to the most recently available figures. However, it is relatively hard to secure asylum in the UK, which hosts less than 1% of the world’s refugees. Furthermore, the hostile environment policy, including the UK’s use of immigration detention (it is one of the only countries in the world where the period of detention is not capped), is likely to have deterred some people from wanting to seek asylum at all for fear they will end up in purgatory. The Dublin regulation, an EU law which states that an individual is eligible to be given asylum only in the first safe country they arrive in, encouraged people with good reasons for wanting to travel to the UK – for example, good command of the language – to attempt to do so by dangerous backdoor routes, often facilitated by ruthless people smugglers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “Nobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy, which has deliberately shut down safe and legal routes to the UK. “We need more than empty expressions of sadness and shock from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson. We need a commitment to opening safe and legal routes to the UK and quick decisions for people seeking to make a better life for themselves in the UK. People move – they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their life to do so.” The National Crime Agency has responsibility for tackling what it calls organised immigration crime. This stands apart from modern slavery and human trafficking because it involves consent on the part of the individual travelling, while the latter involves coerced movement across borders. However, there is an obvious overlap and the incident in Essex could be either of the two. A range of methods are used in organised immigration crime, including clandestine entry from near Europe, air-facilitated migration, use of false or fraudulently obtained documents and abuse of legitimate entry and leave to remain. In 2018 new migrant camps emerged in the Grande-Synthe and Puythouck Lake areas near Dunkirk, where organised crime gangs are known to be active, recruiting migrants for onward movement to the UK. Juxtaposed border controls remain the main targets for clandestine entry into the UK. These controls are part of an arrangement between the UK, France and Belgium whereby immigration checks on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding a train or ferry, rather than on arrival. In 2018 the number of Eritreans detected at juxtaposed controls increased notably, with Eritrean nationals found concealed in refrigerated lorries and containers, probably indicating growing levels of organisation. The Guardian understands that last year more than 35,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented at the UK’s juxtaposed controls in northern France and Belgium. During the same 12-month period, more than 8,000 people were detected in the UK, either at ports of entry or having entered the country illegally on a vehicle. The top 10 nationalities of undocumented people found at juxtaposed controls in 2018 were Eritrean, Iraqi, Afghan, Iranian, Albanian, Sudanese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Syrian and Ethiopian. What could be done in the UK to reduce the chance of individuals attempting such risky journeys? Refugee and asylum seeker rights campaigners have been calling for an extension to refugee family reunion rules to include a wider definition of family, allowing individuals safely based in the UK to bring family members to join them. There have also been calls for the resettlement programme for Syrian refugees, which is run by the UN refugee agency, to be extended to other countries. • This article was amended on 24 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Syrian refugee settlement programme as the only one which operates without the person reaching Britain. The Syrian programme is one of a small number of limited refugee resettlement schemes."
2019-11-01T07:00:22Z,'Living a daily tragedy': Venezuelans struggle to survive in Colombia,"Axleny Machado has slept on a piece of foam outside Maicao’s main bus terminal since she arrived from Venezuela a year ago. She’s one of thousands who live this way in the arid border city in La Guajira, northern Colombia, which is now struggling with the huge influx of migrants and refugees. Machado, 24, has a small trolley she rents for 90p a day to sell cigarettes, coffee and sweets to commuters. If lucky, she makes about £4 a day – enough to look after herself. She wants to leave Maicao for another Colombian city and look for opportunities, but money doesn’t permit. Since sleeping at the bus terminal, she’s been robbed of her passport, clothes and phone. “I prefer to sleep here than in the city centre – it’s really dangerous now,” she says, sitting on a bench outside the bus station with her sister as her mother sweats over a gas stove, cooking rice. Maicao’s streets are bursting with homeless Venezuelans taking refuge. Mothers with small children sleep on flattened-out cardboard boxes on dirty pavements. Drug use and sex work are rife and resources are scarce. The central market is one of the main areas in which they reside. Since Venezuela’s economic collapse began under the presidency of Nicolás Maduro in 2016, violence, insecurity and a severe lack of basic food and medicine have caused more than 4 million people to flee. An estimated 1.5 million have settled in Colombia. About 59,500 have settled in Maicao, smaller in size and with less public infrastructure than the more popular migrant entry point of Cúcuta, and it’s struggling to cope. A UN assessment of Venezuelans’ living conditions in Maicao found almost half were living on the streets, or in informal settlements in and around the city. A year ago, with public spaces and local infrastructure like hospitals and schools starting to collapse, the city’s mayor pleaded with the UN for help. The UN refugee agency, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), opened its first camp in Colombia, giving a maximum of one month’s temporary respite to the most vulnerable. Yolimar Ochoa, 34, was allowed six weeks in the camp. Single, pregnant and with five young children, she was sleeping on the streets. Her baby was born not long after leaving the camp, and she’s thankful to the UN and organisations like Mercy Corps who provided her with temporary cash payments for basic needs. It helped her pay for a small bedroom near the overcrowded marketplace she shares with all her children, the eldest 16, who is pregnant. None of them currently attend school. Now her money is running out. “I don’t want to go back to the street again. There are a lot of really bad people around here,” she says, standing outside the entrance to Maicao’s cemetery where she and her five children slept on concrete for a year. “I eat small meals, basic things like plantain, and potatoes, to save money to pay rent.” About 1,200 people have benefited from the camp, but the mayor’s office believes it has made little difference. “The idea was to take a human being with needs and change that, so after [being in the camp] they’d have an introduction about how to be a citizen with rights and duties. That’s not happening,” says Aldemiro Santo, government secretary in Maicao’s mayor’s office. He says crime is taking over the city. “Maicao is living in tragedy on a daily basis.” Santo says many Venezuelans who arrive do so with scant idea of how they will survive in Colombia, making them more vulnerable to crime. Hugh Aprile, director of Mercy Corps in Colombia, says there “are simply not enough resources to help the thousands of Venezuelans who continue streaming across the border in Colombia”. As well as the physical hardship, refugees are faced with xenophobia, moving the UNHCR to launch a campaign, Somos Panas – “We’re mates”, roughly translated – to remind Colombians of how Venezuela helped them when thousands fled the long-running civil war. Coupled with this, a group of 220 Venezuelan volunteers have begun cleaning up the streets of Maicao and interacting with locals to show they respect the city and set an example. “There has been a complete collapse in public space in Maicao and also issues with security – all related to the effects of migration,” says Edinson Gomez, who oversees the project, known as Banco Amable (“kind bank”). “This has brought xenophobia with it.” Gomez says the project has been well received by locals and “allows them to see Venezuelans in a different way”. Edgar Alexander Gomez, 50, a volunteer, says: “It changes the way Colombians think of us – we’re not all bad.” Gomez arrived seven months ago with his sister Maria, 54, who also volunteers. Between them, they taken a host of short and informal jobs to keep them afloat in Maicao. The migration crisis has also led to more gang violence in Maicao, as rival groups vie for control of the lucrative petrol market. For decades criminal groups from Venezuela and Colombia have taken advantage of the porous border to smuggle petrol across the border, says Gimena Sánchez-Garzoli of the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank. “These groups often have diverse operations happening at once, including arms, drugs, migrants and smuggling goods,” says Sánchez-Garzoli. “They often fight over territory, are violent and corrupt locals to look the other way, or assist in their operations. If public forces pursue them, they conveniently escape to the other side.” Extortions and kidnappings have also been on the rise. Local media is flooded with reports of local business owners being extorted and kidnapped, to pay money to criminal groups. Many public officials and NGOs interviewed were hesitant to comment on these issues. The mayor’s office says locals are “fed up” with the violence, increase in drugs now available in the city, and rising sex work among the migrant population. Andrea, 19, fled Venezuela’s Margarita Island two years ago. She has a four-year old child. “When you work as a prostitute on the street, it’s dangerous, but really dangerous here [in Maicao],” she says. A group of refugee transgender sex workers were forced to flee Maicao because of alleged attacks by local officials. The Guardian has seen photos of trans women who had been attacked and had their heads shaved, allegedly by Maicao police. “The people of Maicao aren’t ready for people like that,” says Santo when questioned about the incident. He denies any police brutality. “This sexual freedom of expression … people need time to be able to accept them.” Tensions are likely to be exacerbated as the crisis in Venezuela deepens. Colombia’s foreign ministry estimates that another 1.3 million Venezuelans will cross the border by next year. But Gomez remains positive. “I am going to look for a better life here, but I am not losing hope of returning to my country,” he says."
2019-02-12T10:48:27Z,'Migrant menace': Salvini accused of targeting  refugees and ignoring mafia,"In recent decades, the ruthless Casalesi clan of the Camorra mafia has earned billions of euros by burying more than 150,000 cubic metres of toxic waste in the countryside north of Naples. So last Thursday night, when 90 carabinieri paramilitary police officers surrounded several apartment buildings in Caserta, the provincial capital, many residents thought an anti-mafia blitz was under way. The targets were in fact immigrants, under scrutiny for sanitary inspections of their homes. It is part of a trend since Matteo Salvini of the far-right League became interior minister in June 2018. Senator Pietro Grasso, a member of the national anti-mafia commission and former prosecutor responsible for the 2006 arrest of the Sicilian mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, said: “Unfortunately, the Italian government […] is prioritising immigration, making people believe it is an emergency, rather than fighting the real problems, such as the mafia. Meanwhile, the bosses are getting richer and richer.” On Sunday, Salvini announced the interior ministry would review spending on police protection for men and women under threat from the mafia, declaring “some people have been under police escort for too long”. In Catania, the eastern Sicilian stronghold of the powerful Santapaola clan, prosecutors are investigating NGO rescue boats, one of which was ordered to be seized in November after fears that discarded clothes worn by people arriving from Libya could have been contaminated with HIV. In Riace, part of Reggio Calabria, from where the feared ‘Ndrangheta is thought to control much of Europe’s cocaine trade, Mimmo Lucano, an anti-mafia mayor who revitalised his community by welcoming asylum seekers, has been under investigation since October on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration. Lucano has had repeated death threats from mafiosi, who also poisoned two of his dogs. In the past eight months, nearly 250 of Salvini’s tweets have addressed immigration, compared with 60 about organised crime. Nicola Gratteri, one of Italy’s most respected anti-mafia prosecutors, said: “I’ve heard him [Salvini] talking about immigration a lot. Haven’t heard him talking about the mafia yet.” When Salvini has tweeted about organised crime, for example the arrests in December of 90 people in Europe and South America accused of links to the ‘Ndrangheta, it has often concerned investigations that began before his tenure. Arrivals to Italy have decreased by more than 80% since their peak. Thousands of police officers have conducted searches and inspections, and hundreds of people have been forcibly removed from welcome centres. Many of them are now homeless. The evictions followed the approval of the “Salvini decree”, which removed humanitarian protections for those not eligible for refugee status and suspended the asylum application process for individuals considered “socially dangerous”. Claudio Fava, the head of Sicily’s anti-mafia commission, whose father was murdered by the mafia in 1984, said: “The new security decree is a mirror of Salvini’s propaganda. “The law addresses almost exclusively immigration, but a security decree should also be concerned with the mafia, which is clearly not a priority for Salvini. The only element in the decree that mentions the mafia regards the seizure of property.” The Salvini decree established that villas confiscated from mafiosi would be auctioned off publicly after a certain time. Experts have questioned this, citing the likelihood that properties could be purchased by citizens acting as stand-ins for mafia bosses. It feels as though the Italian mafias no longer make headlines, but others do. The interior ministry has carried out a ferocious campaign against what Salvini has described as a worse menace – the mysterious Nigerian mafia. In recent months, magistrates have arrested numerous individuals within the Nigerian community on suspicion of belonging to mafia clans. Many investigators point out the Nigerian clans are subordinate to the Italian mafias, but Salvini and his supporters have been swift in justifying anti-immigration policies in the face of what they describe as an “invasion” of alleged African mafia bosses, which has risked aggravating racial prejudice. The linking of migrant communities and organised crime has echoes of the past in Italy. Between 1880 and 1915, 4 million Italians reached the US, a small minority of whom were tied to the mafia, the largest criminal organisation in the world. Mario Del Pero, a professor of international history at Sciences Po, said: “The anti-Italian prejudice, or rather ‘Italophobia’, was very strong in the United States. Its origins ranged from widespread hostility against the Catholic church to labelling Italians as criminals. Restrictive laws passed in 1921 and 1924 were written precisely to keep Italians out.” In Caserta, the parallels are not lost. Moses, 34, who is from Nigeria and had his home searched by police, said: “[It is] the same sort of prejudice that migrants are facing in Italy more than 100 years later. History repeats itself, in this country more than anywhere else.”"
2019-12-05T14:37:45Z,Pope's aide takes 33 refugees to Rome after visit to 'shameful' Lesbos camp,"An aide to Pope Francis has urged Catholic churches across Europe to open their doors to refugees after bringing 33 people to Rome from overcrowded, squalid camps on the Greek island of Lesbos. Speaking on his return from a visit to the camps, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Vatican’s almoner, condemned the EU’s handling of the refugee situation, saying that “animals live better in Europe”. The 33 refugees, among them families from Cameroon, Afghanistan and Togo, arrived in Rome on Wednesday night and will be hosted by the Vatican and the Sant’Egidio charity. “We have the money, let’s begin with ourselves … let’s open our rectories, convents and monasteries to at least one family each from the Lesbos refugee camps so that we can empty them all,” Krajewski said after landing at Fiumicino airport, in Rome, with the group from Lesbos. “I have seen terrible situations in the camps.” The population in the island’s camps has increased from 7,000 in May to more than 15,000, of whom 800 are unaccompanied children, Krajewski said. “There is no hope for them stuck in Greece, where they are living in dramatic conditions. This is a problem for Europe and is shameful.” The Vatican’s latest “human corridor” mission from Lesbos was implemented following the approval of Greek authorities and the Italian interior ministry. Pope Francis, who has likened migrant facilities on Lesbos to “concentration camps”, brought back 12 Syrian families after visiting the island in 2016. They were temporarily housed by the Vatican before being helped to integrate into society by Sant’Egidio. Ten more people will be transferred to Italy from Lesbos by the end of the year. Greece has been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe over the conditions in refugee camps across its islands. On Thursday a fire broke out in a container housing a family of five Afghans in the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos, killing a 27-year-old woman. Other camp residents managed to safely evacuate the children – an infant, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. The children’s mother was found dead after the fire was extinguished. Their father suffered smoke inhalation. A fire broke out at the crowded Moria camp in Lesbos in September killing a woman from Afghanistan and triggering clashes between refugees and police. The facility has been hit by several fires since the EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants, with a woman and child dying in a blaze that year. In November Greece’s centre-right government, which came to power in July, announced plans to close the three largest migrant camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners compared to detention centres. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. It has also passed a law tightening asylum requirements and pledged to increase border controls. Krajewski was named almoner, a job that Pope Francis transformed into a hands-on charitable mission, in 2013. He has worked discreetly, for the most part, for the poor for years. However, in May this year he made headlines after climbing down a manhole and breaking a seal to restore electricity to a building in Rome where 250 homeless people were living. The move prompted an angry reaction from the far-right politician Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister."
2019-11-19T22:13:52Z,Dozens of migrants found in refrigerated container on ferry,"Dutch authorities have discovered 25 migrants stowed away inside a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for England. According to a statement published on a local government website, all those found onboard were alive, with one of them thought to be a child. The ferry, Britannia Seaways, run by DFDS Seaways, had left the port in Vlaardingen bound for Felixstowe, Suffolk but returned immediately after discovering the people on board. The ship was met by 20 ambulances, and two of the migrants were taken to hospital to be checked for hypothermia. The other 23 received a medical check-up in the port before being processed by police, according to a statement from emergency services. The origins of the migrants are currently unknown, but reports suggest most of them are male. Mirjam Boers, a spokeswoman for Rotterdam police, told the broadcaster RTL that all migrants found on the ship were undergoing checks by emergency responders, but could not comment on the severity of their conditions. “The highest priority is to check how they’re doing medically … This is about human lives and the main thing is that they’re all okay”, she said. She could not confirm whether a child was amongs those found on the ship. Police also told the Dutch broadcaster NOS that the driver of the lorry had been detained and was being questioned about possible human trafficking offences. A DFDS spokesperson said the crew found the people hiding inside a refrigerated container and alerted the police, who arrived on the boat while it was still at sea. The spokesperson said the container was normally locked and sealed, but the stowaways had made a hole in the trailer door. Asked about the security of the containers, the spokesperson told the Guardian security was “very tight” but the incident would be reviewed. “We have surveillance and regular checks of the trailers. It’s a mystery to us. We have good cooperation with authorities at all of our ports, but we have to realise that sometimes migrants do succeed in getting through,” they said. According to the Dutch newspaper AD, police had to search the ferry for more than an hour to find the correct container. The incident follows the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex last month. All of the 39 people who died were Vietnamese nationals, who had travelled inside a refrigerated container from Zeebrugge in Belgium."
2019-03-05T14:58:15Z,The Odd Couple with refugees: how sitcom Home humanises the migrant crisis,"Rufus Jones, writer and co-star of a new sitcom about a Syrian refugee who moves in with a south London family, is recounting an incident in the local library where he wrote the show. “There was a homeless guy and a guy of Middle-Eastern origin next to me. The homeless guy just walked up and screamed two minutes worth of race hate in his face. It was terrifying.” Jones stepped in to divert the aggressor, while librarians comforted the victim and called the police. Look for the helpers, we’re told. And there they often are – but Jones was shaken to see the fiction he’d been writing loom large before him. A similar scene plays out in a Post Office queue in the show, Home, when our hero Sami Ibrahim (played by Youssef Kerkour), goes to collect his weekly subsistence payment of £37 while he awaits his final asylum interview. When an irritable man suggests he go back where he came from, Sami offers his £37 and profound apologies. He’s just an English teacher from Syria, looking for a safe place for his family. The setup is a traditional “alien in the family” one, reminiscent of Paddington or The Iron Giant. An outsider arrives in the form of Sami, a big friendly oak of a man from Damascus. He hides in the family’s car boot as they return from holiday in France. We first meet him folded into the luggage space of their hatchback, his big limbs bent around suitcases. Katy (Rebekah Staton, the mighty Della from Raised by Wolves) reacts with compassion and offers help, while her partner Peter’s response (Jones in twitchy Brexiteer mode) is fearful and less kind. Throughout the series, people’s reactions to Sami take the temperature of the immigration debate from all sides. Nothing is cut and dried, but Sami is the warm, pumping heart of the piece. Jones began writing Home in 2015, as the referendum loomed and the rhetoric around immigration escalated. Who can forget Nigel Farage standing before the words “Breaking Point” in red, foot-high letters against a photograph of a crowd of people with brown faces, apparently pouring across the UK’s flimsy borders thanks, Farage said, to an EU that had “failed us all”. Was Jones angry when he put pen to paper? “I was. I feel unqualified to write about so much of this stuff, but my anger pushed through those questions.” As a privileged white guy, he is acutely aware of his unsuitability to tell this story. “Did I feel it was completely out of my reach, and did I feel inappropriate writing it? Absolutely,” he admits. “The fortunate thing is that, as a writer, I feel like that about everything.” You’ll probably recognise Jones from a comedy career that’s seen him scene-stealing in everything from W1A (as the anodyne BBC exec David Wilkes) to Terry Jones in Holy Flying Circus. Or in a brace of Julia Davis productions, Hunderby and Camping, in which he always seems to end up naked or sexually humiliated. His own comic voice doesn’t spring from the now heavily-used comedy of embarrassment or the purely sentimental, but from a place between the two, full of nuance and identification. “The two words we kept using on set were tolerance and empathy,” he says. Home is Jones’ response to the ever-widening national divide and a shift in the UK’s ability to extend the hand of friendship like it used to. Back in 2015, he recalls reading a Guardian article in which Helen Pidd talked about inviting a refugee to share her home. Jones noticed “little golden moments of comedy beneath these extremely moving stories”. He began to imagine the “flat-share, Odd Couple story just trying to get out”. Kerkour, who auditioned thinking there was no way he’d be cast as Sami, went along to tell Jones he loved his script. He wanted to offer any expertise he could, coming from an Anglo-Moroccan household and being fluent in Arabic. “Rufus has this superpower where he’s able to make you laugh at the comedy while you cry at the truth,” says Kerkour. As Staton finds the benevolence in Katy, Kerkour’s Sami is cut through with a seam of pure rage. His wife and son languish in Berlin, unable to get to him and he waits at the mercy of an arbitrary process which could fulfil or crush his dreams with the stroke of a pen. “There’s this torrent of emotion inside him that he’s bottled up, because if he lets it out, he’s not going to be able to maintain control.” He has relished the chance to play someone who isn’t, in his own words, “a killer”. With his 6 ft 5 frame and Middle-Eastern features, he’s played more terrorists than teachers. Staton’s scenes with Kerkour bounce along as she adopts a sisterly irreverence to put him at ease. She tells him, talking about the national anthem, “Liking Jerusalem is basically as patriotic as it’s acceptable for a British person to be ... One day it’s Jerusalem, the next you’re going to air shows and wanking over jigsaws of Princess Anne.” As soon as Channel 4 commissioned the show, Jones contacted Hassan Akkad, one of the refugees who made the treacherous passage from Syria to Europe in 2015, filming his experience for the BBC documentary Exodus: Our Journey to Europe. In a surreal turn, 20 months after risking his life in a small boat off the coast of Turkey, Akkad was collecting the Bafta for Best Factual Series. Was he worried about turning his experience into comedy? “We’re not laughing at Sami,” says Akkad, whose life spookily mirrors his own; an English teacher fleeing Damascus. “We’re being entertained by the reality that any refugee goes through once they arrive here.” For a first sitcom, Home is striking for the deft tap-dance of its dialogue. Even while Sami’s plight is cracking your heart, Jones’ words put on a dazzling show. Sometimes the gags are just playful (Sami mistakes Marmite for chocolate spread, gobbling down a spoonful), others outright profound. In one scene, an off-guard Peter yells at Sami, “We’re full up!” But it doesn’t work, replies Sami, if you say that and “it echoes”. Home starts on Channel 4 tonight at 9.45pm."
2019-08-19T15:50:52Z,Greek NGO helping child refugees wins $2m humanitarian prize,"An NGO helping migrant and refugee children in Greece has won the world’s biggest annual humanitarian award. METAdrasi – Action for Migration and Development received the $2m (£1.6m) Hilton humanitarian prize for its “innovative approach to welcoming refugees and protecting unaccompanied minors”, the Conrad N Hilton Foundation said. Peter Laugharn, the foundation’s president and CEO, told the Guardian: “METAdrasi … demonstrates the power of individuals to make a marked difference in the lives of migrants and refugees in Greece.” Laugharn praised METAdrasi’s pursuit of common-sense solutions, including engaging translators “fluent in over 43 languages and dialects to help navigate extremely complicated policies and procedures”. The frontline organisation was founded in 2009 with the aim of safeguarding the rights of people displaced by war or persecution. From the outset it placed particular emphasis on minors who had reached Greece alone either because they had lost or been separated from parents along the way. The NGO has a permanent presence at all key entry points to Greece and acts as a safety net for unaccompanied children, transporting them from detention centres to suitable accommodation, finding guardians and placing them in foster care or in conditions of supported independent living. It employs 350 interpreters and has helped more than 12,000 minors. METAdrasi’s founder, Lora Pappa, said of the award: “It will enable us to strengthen our advocacy and help us be heard. This is an ongoing crisis. We are so grateful to receive the prize at a time when urgent needs regarding the refugee situation continue to emerge.” The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates there are 80,000 people stranded in Greece, including 4,100 unaccompanied children. The number of arrivals has dropped dramatically since 2016 when the EU struck a deal with Turkey but they are on the rise again. On Lesbos, the eastern Aegean isle once at the centre of the crisis, 9,000 people are detained in a camp meant to house a third of that number. This month, Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, raised the prospect of as many as 35,000 people a day crossing into Europe if Ankara were to turn a blind eye and open the floodgates. “I’m not threatening Europe, I am just pointing something out,” he warned, claiming that the EU had failed to deliver on its promise to give Turkey agreed funds under the 2016 accord."

Back in 2015, he recalls reading a Guardian article in which Helen Pidd talked about inviting a refugee to share her home. Jones noticed “little golden moments of comedy beneath these extremely moving stories”. He began to imagine the “flat-share, Odd Couple story just trying to get out”. Kerkour, who auditioned thinking there was no way he’d be cast as Sami, went along to tell Jones he loved his script. He wanted to offer any expertise he could, coming from an Anglo-Moroccan household and being fluent in Arabic. “Rufus has this superpower where he’s able to make you laugh at the comedy while you cry at the truth,” says Kerkour. As Staton finds the benevolence in Katy, Kerkour’s Sami is cut through with a seam of pure rage. His wife and son languish in Berlin, unable to get to him and he waits at the mercy of an arbitrary process which could fulfil or crush his dreams with the stroke of a pen. “There’s this torrent of emotion inside him that he’s bottled up, because if he lets it out, he’s not going to be able to maintain control.” He has relished the chance to play someone who isn’t, in his own words, “a killer”. With his 6 ft 5 frame and Middle-Eastern features, he’s played more terrorists than teachers. Staton’s scenes with Kerkour bounce along as she adopts a sisterly irreverence to put him at ease. She tells him, talking about the national anthem, “Liking Jerusalem is basically as patriotic as it’s acceptable for a British person to be ... One day it’s Jerusalem, the next you’re going to air shows and wanking over jigsaws of Princess Anne.” As soon as Channel 4 commissioned the show, Jones contacted Hassan Akkad, one of the refugees who made the treacherous passage from Syria to Europe in 2015, filming his experience for the BBC documentary Exodus: Our Journey to Europe. In a surreal turn, 20 months after risking his life in a small boat off the coast of Turkey, Akkad was collecting the Bafta for Best Factual Series. Was he worried about turning his experience into comedy? “We’re not laughing at Sami,” says Akkad, whose life spookily mirrors his own; an English teacher fleeing Damascus. “We’re being entertained by the reality that any refugee goes through once they arrive here.” For a first sitcom, Home is striking for the deft tap-dance of its dialogue. Even while Sami’s plight is cracking your heart, Jones’ words put on a dazzling show. Sometimes the gags are just playful (Sami mistakes Marmite for chocolate spread, gobbling down a spoonful), others outright profound. In one scene, an off-guard Peter yells at Sami, “We’re full up!” But it doesn’t work, replies Sami, if you say that and “it echoes”. Home starts on Channel 4 tonight at 9.45pm."
2019-12-19T11:49:08Z,Boy found alone on M6 motorway after arriving in UK,"A boy believed to be a 15-year-old from Iraq has been found alone on a motorway near Birmingham after allegedly entering the UK illegally. Police officers responding to reports of a pedestrian on the M6 took him into emergency care on Wednesday night and he was subsequently transferred to the care of local social services. West Midlands police contacted the Home Office’s immigration enforcement division shortly after finding him. Using an interpreter, he told of how he had come to the UK, that he was 15 years old, from Iraq, and did not know where his parents were. It is thought he entered the UK recently. “He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn’t know which country they’re in,” the central motorway police group said. “It’s impossible to imagine how scared someone would be, not knowing where they are, not knowing where their parents are, unable to speak the language. “We’ve taken him to a place of safety with food and water until social services can come and take him to care.” West Midlands police said a driver reported seeing the boy walking on the central reservation towards junction 7, the Great Barr interchange – which is about five miles away from West Bromwich – at 10pm on Wednesday. “He was picked up by a police patrol car and taken into emergency care for the night,” a spokesperson said. “It’s understood the male is from Iraq and the matter has been passed to immigration.” Fizza Qureshi, co-chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, said she could not imagine how the boy was feeling and called on the government to make it easier for people to seek “refuge and protection” in the UK to prevent deaths of people in transit. “We are extremely concerned to hear of this story,” she said. “We cannot begin to imagine how he is feeling, in unfamiliar surroundings, alone and without his family, not knowing what might happen next. “This boy’s journey of being separated from his parents and family, and being alone, would be similar to those of other unaccompanied minors who have come to the UK because no safe routes exist for people to come to the country for refuge and protection. We must create these routes to prevent any further tragedies.” Liz Clegg, from the Meena Centre in Birmingham, which supports child refugees, told the BBC that reuniting children separated from their parents in such circumstances was a “huge challenge”. She hoped “the system in place would kick in quickly” and that she expected authorities and charities would be working to trace his family. Lucy Leon, from the Children’s Society, said he now faced a drawn-out and legally complex situation, and urged for him to be provided with an independent guardian to represent his interests. “We think it is vital he should also be given an independent legal guardian to represent his best interests, ensure his voice is heard, and that he understands the complex immigration process he is about to embark on,” she said. Only children suspected of being victims of trafficking are given independent legal guardians in England and Wales, but in Scotland and Northern Ireland the “vital support” is given to all unaccompanied refugee and migrant children, she added. “It’s incredibly important he’s got a guardian, someone who’s independent, not part of the local authority, not part of the Home Office, who can really support him through that complex legal process,” she said. “Quite often we see in our work young people slipping through the net and not being identified as a victim of trafficking and exploitation, or even at risk.” Iraq was the second most common country of nationality for people applying for asylum in the UK last year. There were 2,700 applicants, 43% of whom were granted protection, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. The Home Office said the boy’s case would be dealt with according to the immigration rules. In October, 39 Vietnamese nationals, including 10 teenagers, were found dead in a lorry in Essex, leading the foreign affairs select committee to declare that the UK’s policy of closing borders drives migrants into smugglers’ hands."
2019-12-04T06:00:43Z,The 'qualifications passport' scheme breaking down barriers for migrants,"The armed rebels had first ransacked the hospital where Timothée* worked as a doctor. Then, they went door to door with machetes, hunting down those seen as the wealthiest – the most educated first. When the house next door was burned down with his neighbours still inside, Timothée fled. Without a chance to grab his passport or phone, Timothée ran through the darkness of the bush of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, knowing he might never see his family or his fiancee again. When he reached a refugee settlement in Meheba, Zambia, in September, Timothée had no proof of his previous life. But now he has a little more hope about the future. In Zambia, a pilot qualifications passport scheme is being run by the government and the UN agency Unesco to help refugees access jobs or further education in the country by informally verifying their qualifications when they do not have crucial paperwork. A joint Unesco/UNHCR report found that fewer than 15% of migrants in developed countries say their level of education matches their jobs. In developing countries one in eight immigrants say that having their qualifications recognised is their greatest challenge in settling into new lives, more so than language, discrimination or even visa restrictions. Of the 60 who applied from his camp, Timothée was among 11 who reached the required standard. Summarising the holder’s qualifications, experience and language skills, as well as any paperwork available, the qualifications passport is designed to help translate a refugee’s qualifications to those in the host country. The scheme is due to be extended to Iraq and Colombia next year. Timothée feels his years of study and medical practice have at last been recognised. “The day I heard my qualifications had been accepted, I was so happy. I thanked God. It’s a way for me to get my identity back,” he says. Last week, Unesco member states adopted a new convention for “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory recognition” of higher education qualifications. Audrey Azoulay, Unesco’s director general, says it is in everyone’s interests to create a “simple mechanism”. “For governments, there is a clear fiscal argument against the squandering of human capital.” Timothée has managed to let his family know where he is via Facebook on a borrowed phone. He has not yet been able to speak to his fiancee but has established through a friend that she is safe. He hopes he might move to a French-speaking country as it would be easier for him to practise medicine there. France would be nice, but he needs travel documents. He knows there are no guarantees yet, but is hopeful. “Doors are opening for me again”, he says. * Surname withheld on request."
2019-06-23T06:00:37Z,Refugee tales and migration – four books that help us understand a crisis,"There’s something vertiginous about the speed with which the political climate has soured over the past decade. From an era of falling walls and blurred borders, of globalisation celebrated as an economic tide that would lift all ships, we are now witnessing a backlash of startling viciousness. Narratives of migration have been co-opted by rightwing politicians and their media cheerleaders, who discard both facts and human rights in their efforts to conjure old fears of invasion and cultural subjugation. Literary responses to political crises generally take years to percolate through – JK Galbraith’s definitive The Great Crash, 1929 was published in 1955 – but such is the urgency of the present moment that already there are a host of books, both fiction and nonfiction, seeking to redress the narrative imbalance around the refugee crisis and immigration more broadly. Dina Nayeri’s The Ungrateful Refugee is a work of astonishing, insistent importance. Like Hisham Matar and Viet Thanh Nguyen, Nayeri speaks firsthand of the refugee experience. She was born in Tehran in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution. Her mother was a proselytising Christian, and she soon found herself fleeing Iran for the Middle East, then Italy. She was interned at Barba, a camp in a dilapidated hotel near Rome. Nayeri ended up in the US, where she attended Princeton, Harvard and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. She then travelled back to Europe, to the camps, seeking to find there some relic of her own life as a refugee. The Ungrateful Refugee interweaves Nayeri’s own story with those of the refugees she meets along the way. “In a refugee camp,” she writes, “stories are everything. Everyone has one, having just slipped out from the grip of a nightmare.” This is a book full of revelatory truths, moments where we are plunged deeply and painfully into the quotidian experience of the refugee. Refugees are trapped in the perpetual present: “The future brings anxiety because you don’t belong and can’t move forward. The past brings depression, because you can’t go home, your memories fade and everything you know is gone.” She visits a tent in a Greek camp whose occupants maintain it scrupulously. “It seems heroic to me, every scavenged and scrubbed item, the toil to keep her family’s dignity in this wasteland.” She notices that instead of pictures, they have teddy bears pinned to the wall. In a place where they need blankets and schoolbooks, there is a surfeit of stuffed bears. “They overflow from the donation bins. American and British well-wishers apparently are always sending bears.” Even the well meaning fail to comprehend the reality of refugee life. Nikesh Shukla’s era-defining collection of essays The Good Immigrant clearly informs Nayeri’s thesis. She recognises that the immediate migrant crisis is masking a deeper issue, the need to treat with dignity those to whom we offer refuge; not to demand assimilation, but to recognise the integrity of their otherness. “Refugees have no agency,” Nayeri says. “Often, they are so broken, they beg to be remade into the image of the native.” It is through writing that Nayeri has managed to “undo the excesses of my assimilation”. It’s a powerful message about the need for such stories in a world that is suffering a collective failure of the sympathetic imagination, where political regimes and rabid rightwing media seek to portray migrants as an abstract, threatening mass, rather than a patchwork of individual lives. Ali Smith’s luminous latest novel, Spring, draws deeply on her participation in Refugee Tales, a project launched in 2014 by the poet David Herd to draw attention to the voiceless hordes trapped within Britain’s byzantine immigration system. Britain is the only country in Europe where refugees can be held indefinitely, with many being locked up for months, even years, passing their lives in bureaucratic blind alleys. The latest Refugee Tales collection – the third instalment (I should declare an interest here – I had a piece in the second) – contains stories told to Monica Ali, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Lisa Appignanesi and Patrick Gale, among others. The Orphan’s Tale, rendered by David Constantine, is characteristic of the power of these narratives to move, to make the political coruscatingly personal. Constantine gives voice to M, a traumatised child from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in the civil war. M came to England, was adopted, grew to be a young man, fell in love, and worked hard to provide for his girlfriend, for her daughter. Then “a clean white hand approaches and between thumb and finger takes hold of the end of a thread and delicately pulls. The unravelling has begun.” We follow M into the sinister and shadowy immigration system, where he is stripped of his possessions, his identity, his access to his family. We leave him in a cell, where he has spent years listening to “the howling of captive fellow human beings who have been told that early next morning they will be on a plane back to where they came from, however bad that place and whatever their loves and friendships, their loyalties, brave beginnings, notable achievements and aspirations here in this worsening land.” Alongside these stories whose horror and hopelessness has a galvanising moral impact, there are others that seek to celebrate the role of migrants in our society. In Our City, the historian and urban policy specialist Jon Bloomfield uses a collage of migrant voices to tell the story of the making of modern Birmingham. Bloomfield has carried out dozens of interviews across several generations of the city’s migrant population; this is a book that speaks of the hope and courage of those who came to Birmingham in the 50s and 60s, when the UK government advertised in newspapers from Jamaica to Pakistan seeking workers for its burgeoning industrial enterprises. Bloomfield delves into each of the city’s immigrant communities – those from Kashmir, from the Caribbean, from eastern Europe and China – as they live through the rise and fall of British industry, the closure of Longbridge and the other car plants that employed a huge proportion of Birmingham’s workforce. In tight, energetic prose, Bloomfield shows how Birmingham’s second and third-generation migrant population embraced the move to a service economy and now look forward to the future with optimism noticeably lacking elsewhere in the country. Jonathan Portes is an economist and academic who wrote a New Labour-commissioned study on the impact of immigration in Britain in 2001. In his short, sharp and compelling book What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?, he uses the fissures exposed by Brexit as an opportunity to carry out a historical survey of British attitudes to migrants, then to contemplate the current state of discourse in the country. The message of the book is clear – in a war of competing narratives, the line on immigration pedalled by the rightwing press cannot be allowed to stand. An ideological battle must be fought with facts and stories that counter the dominant representation of migrants as a threat to economic stability and societal cohesion. In telling the story of Britain’s historical engagement with others, Portes draws on Robert Winder’s consummate Bloody Foreigners (2004), demonstrating the cycles of openness and insularity that have ebbed, flowed and coexisted over the past millennium. It’s evident, he says, that “political controversy over (and hostility to) immigration is anything but new”. He notes that The Merchant of Venice was written at a time when Jews were still not officially allowed into England. He cites the 1884 novel Simiocracy by Conservative MP Arthur Brookfield, which imagines a future where the Liberal government keeps itself in power by extending the franchise to apes and importing millions of African gorillas. There’s Oswald Mosley and the BUF, Enoch Powell and the rivers of blood, the Smethwick election of 1964, in which the Conservatives won on the strapline “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” Then we have Theresa May’s “hostile environment”, the rise of Ukip, and Brexit. Alongside this insularity and xenophobia, Portes tells another story: one of a country that embraces others and is built on the labour of immigrants, from the waves of Protestant refugees in the wake of the Spanish Inquisition, to the Huguenots, the Irish, the Windrush generation, east African Asians and those from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Portes notes that in the 16th century, there were immigration processing centres much like those we have now, where immigrants were “allotted to various areas for settlement”. This was not a reflection of their undesirability, though, but rather “the need to take maximum advantage of this economic opportunity”. Britain has always been a refuge for those fleeing political persecution – among them Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, Napoleon III, Victor Hugo, Karl Marx. The book draws on a great deal of evidence to prove that immigration contributes positively to the British economy. “Immigrants do not take our jobs,” writes Portes, “nor do they make us poorer. Fears about the wider impact of immigration – on public services, crime or ‘cohesion’ – are overstated.” One of the problems, he argues, is that it has been politically expedient for the Conservative government to commingle two separate issues – austerity and immigration, a “shifting of the blame from political decisions on the allocation of resources to immigration”. He cites several studies that illustrate the lack of correlation between Ukip support and local levels of immigration, but a high correlation between austerity-related spending cuts and rises in support for the party. Brexit and the concomitant rise in extremism, Portes claims, are the direct result of the government’s attempts to rebalance the books in the wake of the financial crash. He ends on an upbeat note, claiming that “public attitudes to immigration in the UK are at their most positive in decades”. Despite the positivity of Bloomfield and Portes, it’s hard to look at the regimes of Trump and Orbán, the rise of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage, the persecution of minorities in Burma, Cameroon, Xinjiang and elsewhere, and not to feel that these are dark days we’re living through, that we’re less open, more inward-looking, less accepting of others than at any time in living memory. Nationalism, xenophobia, human rights, hospitality – these are both the stories we tell about ourselves and how we define ourselves in relation to others. It is these stories that shape the geopolitical world, that give us licence to welcome or reject those who come to us in need. One of the striking messages from this timely collection of books is that political systems are set up to treat people in general, rather than individually, and yet each story, each life, demands to be read, to be acknowledged, on its own particular terms. In ignoring them, we allow the story of immigration bellowed by the rightwing press and self-interested politicians to be the only story. • The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (£16.99).

2019-08-25T12:46:19Z,"Nearly 900,000 asylum seekers living in limbo in EU, figures show","Close to 900,000 asylum seekers in the EU are waiting to have their claims processed, according to figures from the European statistics office. Women, men and unaccompanied children are living for years in uncertainty, with numbers of pending applications for international protection almost unchanged from two years ago when 1.1 million migrants were “stuck” in the continent. “Living in limbo is now the norm for those seeking protection,” said Karl Kopp of Pro Asyl, Germany’s largest pro-immigration advocacy organisation. “Limbo means living in the miserable Greek EU hotspots, or being trapped and pushed back at the borders. It means living in the desperate search for protection and human dignity.” Eurostat figures have revealed a backlog of 878,600 requests at the end of 2018, with Germany having the largest share of pending requests (44%), ahead of Italy (12%). The figure comes despite the number of migrant arrivals in Europe practically halving in the last two years. Factors leading to the continuing backlog include new laws from right-leaning governments and an increase in the number of rejections, leading to lengthy appeals processes. “The vision of governments on the migration crisis has changed and more and more countries are rejecting an increasing number of requests for asylum,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo. The rejection rate for asylum requests in Europe has almost doubled in three years, from 37% in 2016 to 64% in 2019. In Italy, rejections were at 80% at the start of 2019, up from 60% the previous year as the populist government also removed key forms of protection. The German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has in 2019 rejected three-quarters of family reunification requests from Greece, where migrants live in the overcrowded camps of Athens and Lesbos. “If a migrant has his asylum request rejected, in any case, he is entitled to have recourse to appeal, which, however, lengthens the time waiting in limbo by up to four years,” said Vassallo. “There are migrants who arrived in 2015 and had their asylum requests denied. At that point they presented an appeal to a court and are still waiting for an answer on their future.” Experts point out how some governments in recent years, especially in Italy and Germany, have accelerated evaluation procedures for asylum requests, which appears to have caused an increase in rejections because high-speed procedures are not carried out with as much thoughtful evaluation. “The agenda of the rightwing extremists is now the agenda of the mainstream and all that matters is high speed, few or no rights in the procedure, highest possible rejection rates and increasing the deportation figures,” said Kopp. “Many rejected asylum seekers receive protection only through a legal action but years of waiting for the court decision extend the limbo situation in an intolerable way.” According to Eurostat, since 2014 there have been 3.6m requests for asylum in EU countries, only 1.8m of which have resulted in legal protection. Those who stay after rejection are at risk of suddenly becoming illegal immigrants. “This is the worrying part of this phenomenon, with thousands of people exposed to the risk of a difficult life, at the mercy of labour exploitation,” said Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Italy. According to Eurostat, Germany reported the highest number of illegal migrants in 2018, with 134,100. France was second with 105,900. But Italy, where hardline measures are likely to keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants, could soon far exceed them. Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the Italian thinktank the Institute for International Political Studies, said that based on analysis of figures from the interior ministry, “there could be more than 700,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy by 2020”."
2019-12-01T11:00:02Z,Tehran Children: A Holocaust Refugee Odyssey – review,"When Mikhal Dekel was a child she would sometimes wake up at night to find her father, Hannan, in the kitchen. “He would be sifting through the garbage can, salvaging a bit of cottage cheese stuck to the container. It used to repel me: my father, a cat pawing through the trash. There was an obsessive, almost mechanical quality to his movements that frightened me.” She didn’t associate Hannan, who served in the Israeli air force for almost 50 years, with the Holocaust. Her father had told her no tales of murderous concentration camps or welcome liberation. Dekel only knew that Hannan, along with his sister Rivka and their cousin Naomi, had been part of a wartime mission by the World Zionist Organisation to rescue Polish Jewish children. They had arrived in what was then British-controlled Palestine in 1943 via Iran and were known as the Tehran Children because Iran had provided their final staging post. It wasn’t until 2007, when Dekel, by then an academic in New York, met the writer Salar Abdoh that she learned more. Abdoh knew the story of the Tehran Children from an Iranian perspective and regarded his country’s role in their rescue as evidence that his culture was not intrinsically antisemitic. Dekel asked him to collaborate on retracing her father’s journey. Working together seemed to her to be a way to “overcome vexed oppositions like Jew/Christian/Muslim, a way of sidestepping the deep and deepening impasse between Israel and the Islamic Republic”. Based on their almost eight years of research into Dekel’s father’s convoluted 13,000-mile journey, the book draws on archives in Russia, Poland and Central Asia that have only been opened up in the last decade, as well as records kept in Israel, the UK and by the Red Cross. The result is a book that is both a highly personal, journalistic memoir and a valuable addition to Holocaust history. Dekel traces her family’s journey as they fled east from their home town in Poland, just ahead of the German invasion in 1939. When the Soviet authorities forced Polish citizens in 1940 to work in the gulags in Siberia, the family nearly starved before being shipped on to Uzbekistan. They were part of a wave of famished Polish refugees in Tashkent and Samarkand, where conditions soon deteriorated with outbreaks of typhus and other diseases. No one knows how many thousands died at each staging post, but when Hannan’s parents were told in late 1942 that there was a chance for unaccompanied minors to go to Iran (then under British rule), they seized it. Trains crammed with soldiers under the command of the Polish government in exile were being sent to strengthen the British armies in the Middle East. Hannan, his sister and cousin joined 1,000 Jewish children on the journey. But Iran itself proved no easy haven. Up to 33,000 Polish soldiers and 11,000 refugees were now under the purview of the British army. The initial warm welcome from Iran’s Jewish population in August 1942 turned sour when supplies ran low and winter threatened. Local newspapers denounced the new arrivals as “parasites of the allies”. Graffiti on Tehran’s walls read “all of Persia is hungry as it watches the Poles and the British eat its bread”. Fearful of a local uprising, the British shipped the Polish Catholic refugees on to New Zealand, India and Africa; some 861 Polish Jewish children, including Dekel’s father, were sent on to British Palestine. No nation comes out with an unblemished record; once settled in a kibbutz in 1943, Hannan and his sister pleaded with the British authorities to allow their mother, who had survived, to join them. It wasn’t until 1949 that they were reunited in newly established Israel. Dekel recalls the stigma then attached to the traumatised European Jews; she describes them as having a “muted aura of shame and anxiety in the Israel of my youth”. It was easier to be proud of her father. The Tehran Children had been given far higher status because their rescue by the Jewish agency had been a great achievement; their arrival in February 1943 had been greeted with cheering crowds and jubilant newsreels. At every stage of her family’s odyssey, Dekel uncovers reports and witness accounts of corruption and mistreatment. Yet her book doesn’t just cast light on an overlooked chapter in the fate of Europe’s Jews in the second world war. It lets us see how challenging it is trying to tell that story fairly. When the records and testimonies uncover overtly antisemitic discrimination by the Polish, Dekel’s formerly helpful Polish archivist becomes defensive. Dekel’s original plan to co-author the book with Abdoh is abandoned as the story becomes more about her father’s journey through Russia and Central Asia than his time in Iran. Tehran Children tackles the difficulties of recounting history from the perspective of today’s fluctuating political orthodoxy. What makes Dekel’s study so valuable is not just its assiduous detailing of one family’s fate during the second world war, but how it also makes us reflect on our current era, with its mass migrations of desperate people fleeing conflict and hardship only to meet inflamed nativism and the desire to shift responsibility for their fate from one country on to the next. • Tehran Children: A Holocaust Refugee Odyssey by Mikhal Dekel is published by WW Norton &amp; Co (£19.99) • A caption on this review was amended to clarify that Gdansk was not part of Poland in 1939; it was known as Danzig and the population was majority German."
2019-09-04T17:21:55Z,Matteo Salvini replaced by migration specialist in new Italy coalition,"A career civil servant and specialist in migration policy has succeeded the far-right leader Matteo Salvini as Italy’s interior minister in a new left-leaning pro-European coalition government aimed at drawing a line under a crisis sparked by Salvini’s populist League party. Luciana Lamorgese, a veteran of the interior ministry, has in recent years been in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy and is known for promoting integration events and policies. She was also the first female security chief, or prefect, of Milan. Her appointment should mark a break from the era of Salvini, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers. The coalition assembled by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) also includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister. The new government is expected to be sworn in on Thursday. During the coalition negotiations, the PD repeatedly asked the M5S to abandon the migration policies of the previous government, in which it was in coalition with the League. The key was the abolition of a Salvini-drafted security decree that provided for the seizure of NGO rescue boats and fines for vessels that brought migrants to Italy without permission. Dozens of captains of rescue boats and volunteers subsequently ended up under investigation, with at least eight in the last three months. Prosecutors in Ragusa on Tuesday placed the German captain and the mission chief of the Eleonore rescue ship, operated by the NGO Mission Lifeline, under investigation on suspicion of encouraging illegal immigration. The captain had declared a state of emergency onboard and defied the entry ban, landing more than 100 migrants in Pozzallo, Sicily. Last week Italian officials handed a €300,000 (£270,000) fine to the Mare Jonio, operated by the Italian NGO Mediterranea, which saved more than 100 migrants, including 22 children under the age of 10. Although the number of migrant arrivals in Europe has practically halved in the last two years, hundreds of asylum seekers continue to attempt the crossing from north Africa. Last week, at least two known shipwrecks were registered, according to aid groups, with a total of almost 70 people drowned, while at least two boats have been completely lost. In recent weeks, NGO vessels have saved more than 600 people in total. A French passenger ferry headed to Marseilles from Algiers on Monday rescued 18 people off the Balearic Islands. Campaigners and aid groups hope that, with the new government and above all with the new minister of the interior, Italian policy on the migration crisis can finally change. Graziano Delrio, the PD leader in the lower house, said on Wednesday that a new immigration law has been included in the new government’s political agenda. Carlotta Sami, a spokesperson for the UNHCR in Italy, said: “There is a humanitarian crisis for which everyone must feel responsible: the search and rescue at sea and the common management, at European level, of landings. “There is a chance to carry out inclusion policies towards refugees, policies that consider them a resource and not a problem. There is a lot to do, but we hope Rome will resume the central and crucial role it deserves in these issues.’’ On Tuesday M5S members overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the PD in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes. “This turning point is good. Now it’s time to change Italy,” said the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti. “We have stopped Salvini and the mere announcement of this phase is making Italy a protagonist again in Europe.” Salvini, who pulled the plug on Conte’s last government on 8 August seeking snap elections he hoped would boost his party, described the new pro-European coalition as “a government born between Paris and Berlin and from the fear of leaving their posts, without dignity and without ideals, with the wrong people in the wrong place. “They won’t be able to dodge the judgment of the Italians for too long. We’re ready … in the end it is us who will win.” The new ministers will face confidence votes starting on Monday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches."
2019-12-06T07:00:36Z,Make do and lend to a refugee entrepreneur this Christmas,"Feeling fed up with festive consumerism? You could give a gift that will help a refugee entrepreneur this Christmas. A gift voucher allows the recipient to lend money to a refugee in Rwanda, who can then use the cash to start or expand a small business in their refugee camp or local community. This scheme will help people such as Zeburiya Nyiramana, who sells basic household items, fruit and vegetables from the small shop she set up in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda. She fled from the Democratic Republic of the Congo several years ago and lives with her six children and one other child she has adopted. Nyiramana started by selling vegetables around the camp and, once she began to generate a bit of profit, she saved and bought a small place to use as a permanent shop. With her Lendwithcare loan, Nyiramana will buy more fruit, vegetables, clothes and shoes to sell. Another refugee entrepreneur is Dada Nyirabuntu, who lives with her family in the Kigeme camp, where she arrived aged 18 with her parents and six siblings. She sells groceries, fruit, vegetables, mobile credit and mobile money transfer services to help support her family. After noticing many of her fellow refugees would travel long distances outside the camp to buy essentials, she decided to start her own business with the money she had managed to save. Lendwithcare gift vouchers allow Britons to loan relatively small sums of money to people in 11 countries, including individuals trying to improve their lives after fleeing social and political unrest and violence. Lendwithcare is a peer-to-peer microfinance website set up by the aid charity Care International UK, and this is the first time it has operated in a refugee camp. When you buy someone a Lendwithcare gift voucher, they can go online to choose an individual to lend the money to. This might be a refugee in Rwanda, but it could be an individual in one of the 10 other countries: Cambodia, Ecuador, Malawi, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories, Peru, the Philippines, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. They will use the money to start or expand their small business, thereby helping them feed their family or send their children to school. The entrepreneur receives 100% of each loan. The idea is the money will be repaid, at which point the voucher recipient can withdraw it for themselves, or lend the cash to another budding entrepreneur. Most of the Lendwithcare entrepreneurs are women. Some have been widowed and are carrying on running the family enterprise, while others are single parents looking to get a new venture off the ground. There are also groups of women seeking loans. Since the website launched in 2010, more than 56,000 people have lent in excess of £25m to more than 122,000 entrepreneurs around the world. About 42,000 gift vouchers have been bought since the scheme went live. They are available in various amounts, starting from £15, and can be emailed to the recipient or printed out. Supporters can go on to the website to view profiles of the entrepreneurs and choose who to support. In most cases, the voucher will be a contribution towards the total amount the individual is looking for. These are loans, not free gifts: the money is paid back in instalments to the local microfinance institution that has partnered with Care International in that country, and then credited to the UK lender’s Lendwithcare account. The default rate is very low– about 0.75% – but nevertheless, there is a possibility the entrepreneur will not be able to pay back their loan. And the lender bears the exchange rate risk – in other words, fluctuations in exchange rates may mean there are times when repayments are lower than those set out in the schedule. Lendwithcare has just started operating in two refugee camps in Rwanda: Kigeme and Mahama. The refugees there are mostly from DRC and Burundi. Being able to start a small business enables refugees to start rebuilding their lives, and for those who have lived in a camp for years, it offers them a sense of self worth all too often absent from life in refugee camps, a spokeswoman said. The typical businesses they run include small grocery stalls, cooked food stalls and small canteens and restaurants. Entrepreneurs begin their journey with Lendwithcare at meetings in the camps, which are led by its partner microfinance organisation, Umutanguha, whose mission is to provide essential financial services to financially excluded people in Rwanda. The first step is to learn about the importance of saving. The entrepreneur opens an account using their proof of refugee ID (received when they register at the camp). All entrepreneurs are asked to save for a month so they can become accustomed to setting small sums aside and be sure paying back a loan will be manageable for them. They pay a small amount of interest on the loan. Ethical Christmas cards If you are yet to buy Christmas cards this year, opt for a Guardian Money “best buy” – where the entire purchase price goes to support the Sreepur charity that helps abandoned women and children in Bangladesh. Sreepur, started 30 years ago by Pat Kerr, a former British Airways flight attendant, helps fund itself from the sale of the cards that are made on the site. In 2009, Guardian Money visited the project and we were so taken by what we saw that we have promoted the Christmas cards through our pages ever since. The Sreepur cards are different from anything you will find on the high street, not least because they feature handmade paper and vibrant designs. Buyers can hand over their money in the knowledge the entire purchase price goes to the charity – one that makes a real difference in a country that often hits the headlines for the wrong reasons. A pack of 15 cards costs £14.75, which includes UK postage and packing. For more information on the project and to buy the cards, go to sreepurcards.org."
2019-12-27T00:01:25Z,UK weather 'attracts migrant species but threatens native ones',"Volatile weather led to an influx of exciting migrant species in 2019 but is putting pressure on some homegrown flora and fauna, according to an annual audit of the UK’s environment. Many unusual birds and butterflies ended up on UK soil over the past 12 months, whisked in by high winds or attracted by unseasonably hot spells, and there was good news for native grey seals, dragonflies and wildflowers, the survey from the National Trust reveals. But the erratic conditions made it a challenging year for a string of other resident species, including water voles, terns, toads and puffins. Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation and restoration ecology at the National Trust, warned that the changing weather patterns could lead to some species becoming extinct unless action is taken. He said: “Sightings of migrant insects and birds are becoming more common. This is a result of our changing climate. Although this can seem exciting, the obvious flipside is how these changes will start to affect some of our native species already under pressure from intensive land use, habitat fragmentation and climate change. “More mobile species might be able to escape unfavourable conditions, but they’d have to find similar conditions elsewhere. The biggest threat is to less mobile species and those that are specialists.” Warm weather in the early months of 2019 led to an influx of migrant butterflies, moths and dragonflies from the south and east. For example, significant numbers of painted lady (Vanessa cardui) butterflies were seen arriving en masse for the first time in a decade. Numbers of the Clifden nonpareil moth, which has a rare blue underwing, were at their highest for at least 25 years, while in June, July and October there were good numbers of spectacular migrant dragonflies, including the red-veined darter and vagrant emperor. Grey seals around the UK shores also appear to be thriving, with numbers up this year despite the high 50% mortality rate of seal pups. Certain wildflowers, especially orchids, did well, possibly due to last year’s drought. There were record numbers of bee orchids, dark-red helleborine and autumn lady’s tresses at some sites. However, the picture was grim for other species. The fires on Marsden Moor in West Yorkshire damaged 700 acres of precious habitat for mountain hares and ground-nesting birds such as curlew and twite, undoing years of peat restoration work. It was another challenging year for natterjack toads, who rely on pools of water in their dune habitat to thrive. Because many of these dried out in May and June, spawn and tadpoles were lost. Heavy periods of rainfall affected many species this year, according to the audit. Water voles at Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales suffered due to heavy and unexpected rainfall in June, July and September. Sudden flooding can result in the loss of young, who are unable to swim. Arctic terns, puffins, guillemots and shags all suffered losses due to significant rainfall on the Farne Islands, Northumberland, in June. McCarthy said the audit brought home the importance of making sure current habitats are protected and new ones created. He added: “If our wildlife doesn’t have anywhere to move to as temperatures rise and the weather changes, over the coming years we will inevitably see more and more species at risk of becoming extinct.” Keith Jones, a climate change expert at the National Trust said: “This year’s changeable weather is a symptom of the warming climate. The more our temperatures go up – the more erratic our weather will become. This will force changes to the life cycles of many species as food webs are knocked out of sync.” These were some of the survey’s findings: January to March The year began generally fairly settled over most of UK but this was followed by a blast of snow. There were significant sightings of yellow-browed and Pallas’s warblers, probably driven in by cold weather from continental Europe. The hottest winter day on record was experienced in London on 21 February: 21C. This led to exceptionally early migrant birds, including swallows, house martins and sand martins. Rarities included a red-rumped swallow at the Cwm Ivy salt-marsh in Swansea. There was an early pulse of flowering dandelions. In late March the banded demoiselle damselfly, which typically emerges in mid-May, was seen in south London. April to June In April, Storm Hannah shredded fragile new leaves on trees, probably also impacting nesting birds. It was cold early in May with snow on hills in North Wales and northern England. Cranes bred at Wicken Fen in Cambridgeshire for the first time in at least 120 years. Swifts arrived late – well into May instead of late April. In June, bee orchids flowered profusely. Some had more than 77 flowers on a single stem, in contrast to last year, when there were only about nine. This is most likely due to last year’s heatwave. July to September Migrant moths, including the small marbled, were abundant across the UK and there were good numbers of the western bee-fly in Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. A worrying die-off of adult Arctic terns for a while in Northumberland, caused by botulism in pools where birds bathe. High tides flushed the pools out and the problem stopped. The first confirmed sighting of a brown booby in the UK was claimed by birdwatchers in Cornwall. It was probably blown in from the Caribbean or Mexico. A rare oak polypore fungus – a bracket fungus – was discovered at Ickworth, Suffolk. October to December Red-eyed vireos, north American birds, were seen on Lundy island off the Devon coast and the Lizard, Cornwall. Man o’ war jellyfish were blown on to beaches in Cornwall. Grey seals increased in numbers at Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, in contrast to the harbour seal (common seal), whose numbers appear to be dropping each year. Leaves stayed on trees longer than usual, particularly beech and oak. A pair of snow buntings was seen on Bradnor Hill in Herefordshire, the first in the county since 2006."
2019-11-18T17:48:10Z,Migrants from Libya not driven by hope of being rescued at sea – study,"No valid statistical link exists between the likelihood that migrants will be rescued at sea and the number of attempted Mediterranean crossings, a study has found. The findings challenge the widespread claim in Europe that NGO search and rescue activity has been a pull factor for migrants. Fear that the NGOs’ missions attract immigrants has been the basis for measures restricting humanitarian ships including requiring them to sign up to codes of conduct or simply blocking them from leaving port. It is the first detailed study of NGOs’ proactive search and rescue activity between 2014 and October 2019, but the findings focus most closely on the first nine months of this year, a period when Europe had withdrawn from all search and rescue activity leaving only NGOs or the Libyan guard. The research was undertaken by two Italian researchers, Eugenio Cusumano and Matteo Villa, from the European University Institute Drawing on official statistics and examining three-day averages, the study showed the numbers rescued depend on the numbers leaving. It found a stronger link this year between the number of migrant crossings and either political stability in Libya or the weather, rather than NGO ships at sea. The study found that in 2015, the total number of departures from Libya slightly decreased relative to 2014 even though migrants rescued by NGOs increased from 0.8 to 13% of the total number of people rescued at sea. After July 2017, the number of migrants departing from Libya plummeted even though NGOs had become far and away the largest provider of search and rescue by far. It also found that in the 85 days in which the NGOs were present in the search and rescue mission there were no more departures than the 225 days in which there were Libyan patrol boats. Instead, the study showed the big decline in crossings in 2017 was linked to the deal struck between the Italian government and various Libyan militia to keep migrants from attempting sea crossings. The study looks at figures from the International Organisation for Migration, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and the Italian coastguard. Over the five years the humanitarian ships have rescued a total of 115,000 migrants out of 650,000 with an average of 18%. In 2019 alone, at least 1,078 migrants have died or gone missing, according to the UN, while trying to reach safety in Europe. While the EU recognises the Libyan coastguard and is also funding and training its work, there is no overall agreement about how asylum seekers should be dealt with in an equitable and EU-wide manner."
2019-09-23T17:04:52Z,EU nations come to Italy's aid over relocating migrants,"Four EU countries have sought to break the deadlock over European migration policy, as Italy’s new government underlined its move away from the hardline policies of former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini. Interior ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Malta have agreed a joint proposal to relocate people rescued at sea and end the plight of migrant rescue boats adrift in the Mediterranean while countries bicker over who should help. The proposals were signed off at a special meeting in the fortified coastal city of Birgu in Malta, shortly after Italy’s new left-leaning coalition government agreed to open one of its ports to a second NGO boat carrying 182 people. The departure of Salvini and his far-right League party from the Italian government has led to the reopening of the country’s ports to NGO search and rescue boats and helped bring about the latest tentative agreement as France and Germany lead efforts to show that Italy will not be left alone in handling migrant arrivals from north Africa. However, the politics of migration continues to divide EU member states, even as the number of people making the dangerous central Mediterranean crossing is sharply down on recent years. In a bid to move on from the rancour of recent years, the latest paper proposes “a temporary emergency mechanism”, which means that rescued migrants would be relocated to other EU member states volunteering shelter, after arriving at a Mediterranean port. “I find it crucial that we move away from ship-by-ship arrangements towards a more predictable solution,” said Maria Ohisalo, the interior minister of Finland, which holds the presidency of the Council of the EU and helped broker Monday’s deal. She said the next step was “bringing together as many member states as possible”. “These arrangements in order to be functional need to be built on shared responsibility involving a sufficiently large number of members states.” The voluntary plan will be presented to the EU’s 24 other interior ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg in October. It is unclear how many will sign up. While the European commission wants all member states to be involved in the scheme, ministers suggested that was unlikely. Hungary has led a band of central European refuseniks that will not take in any asylum seekers under an existing EU relocation scheme. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said the number of refugees redistributed through the scheme would depend on how many countries volunteered to take part. “If we had not now managed to produce a proposal with regard to the sea rescue, Europe’s common asylum policy would no longer have been possible for the foreseeable future,” he said. “We are all of the same opinion that there must be a distribution of refugees, that we must not leave Italy and Malta here alone, and that the amount of refugees to be admitted will be discussed and decided in Luxembourg on 8 October, because the amount depends on the number of member states taking part.” The potential breakthrough came as Italy’s government authorised a second NGO rescue boat carrying 182 migrants to disembark in Sicily. Previously ships carrying migrants had been barred from Italian ports. The Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, operated by the French charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières, will disembark in Messina on Tuesday at 7am. The ship has picked up at total of 182 migrants from three rubber dinghies in distress. Passengers include several women, very young children and a newborn baby. Passengers jumped for joy after hearing they could disembark at Messina, Associated Press reported. “I’m so full of joy! I don’t know what to say now. I’m so happy! ... No more back to Libya!” Awudu Baluduzzi, 27, from Ghana, told the agency. On 15 September, 82 other migrants have disembarked in Lampedusa, as Italy’s new government intends to draw a line under the crisis. Giuseppe Conte, on his second mandate as prime minister, has promised to revise the previous government’s anti-immigration policies, which provide for the closure of seaports to rescue vessels carrying migrants, the seizure of NGO boats and fines for ships that bring asylum seekers to Italy without permission. He has formed a coalition between the centre-left Democratic Party and anti-establishment Five Star Movement."
2019-09-02T04:00:35Z,Greece sets out emergency plans to tackle surge of migrant arrivals,"The Greek government has announced emergency measures to deal with what it calls “huge waves” of asylum seekers arriving from Turkey amid mounting fears of the 2015 migrant crisis being replayed on the country’s shores. With boatloads of men, women and children once again arriving on Aegean islands, the new centre-right administration vowed to bolster patrols along sea borders that are being targeted with renewed vigour by people-smugglers. “We are seeing huge waves being brought in by traffickers using new methods and better and faster boats,” the country’s civil protection minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, said after the measures were announced at the weekend. “If the situation were to continue we’d have a repeat of 2015. We are going to take measures to protect our borders and we are going to be much stricter, much faster in applying them.” He added that the Greek government would also appeal to Nato and the EU to help step up patrols in the area. The sharp increase in migrant and refugee arrivals appears to have taken officials by surprise. Last week close to 650 people, including 240 children mostly of Afghan origin, landed in a matter of hours on Lesbos, the north Aegean island on the frontline of the refugee crisis four years ago. A crackdown on migrants in Turkey, home to more than 3.6 million displaced Syrians, and renewed fighting in Syria appear to have spurred the jump. In August, Turkish authorities reported a sevenfold increase in those making the crossing into Greece. Nearly half of the 56,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe this year have come through the Greek islands, according to the UN. NGOs describe camps on the islands as stretched to breaking point with men, women and children forced to live in squalid conditions. Almost 11,000 people are currently crammed into Moria, the main refugee settlement on Lesbos, originally designed to host 3,000 at most. After an Afghan teenager was killed during a fight in the camp last week, Unicef raised the alarm and said over 1,100 unaccompanied children were forced to endure “dangerous and overcrowded” conditions in facilities across Greece. Not since March 2016, when the EU struck a controversial deal with Turkey to stem the flows, has Greece witnessed such a surge in numbers. On Friday the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, summoned the Turkish ambassador in protest. On Monday the government, which assumed power barely two months ago, will begin moving refugees to reception centres on the mainland in an effort to decongest island camps. According to Chrysochoidis around 1,500 will be moved, mostly from Samos and Lesbos. Around 100 unaccompanied minors will also be transferred with a view to joining families in other EU member states. “We will also start sending illegal migrants back to Turkey which, after all, is considered a safe country,” Chrysochoidis said. “Of the 80,000 people presently in Greece half should have been sent back already as they do not have the right documents or fulfil the conditions of asylum seekers. Instead only 1,800 have been readmitted to Turkey.” But human rights groups have voiced concerns. With the new government also vowing to abolish appeals to asylum rejections, there are fears of violations as the emergency measures aiming to bring down migrant arrival numbers are enforced. Still, Chrysochoidis claimed that under Syriza, the former leftist government, a particularly “lax approach” had been taken to asylum procedures that needed to be addressed. “In the absence of enough state doctors on islands, private doctors would hand out papers categorising everyone as vulnerable which has contributed greatly to Greece becoming such an attractive destination for smugglers,” he said. Chrysochoidis, brought in by Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to assume a post he first held two decades ago, has attempted to allay fears that authorities were poised to mount a massive crackdown on migrants by saying the government’s aim was to integrate refugees fully. “We don’t want ghetto camps. Asylum seekers will enjoy all their rights under international law in Greece.”"
2019-12-23T17:30:12Z,"The British government must not abandon these child refugees | Letters
","Many of us in the Jewish community view with much alarm the government’s apparent proposal to scrap a scheme designed to enable child refugees and asylum seekers to be reunited with family members in the UK (Report, 23 December). This appears to be a move from a bilateral treaty arrangement with the EU to a unilateral statement by a country that will be outside of the EU, which will have the effect of weakening the legal rights of vulnerable children. It is estimated that there are some 1,000 young people facing this situation. At this time of the year, when many are focusing on children, we need to question why the government is using this opportunity to add confusion and uncertainty to the desperate situation which many of these children and young people are facing as they languish in unspeakable conditions. The government needs immediately to strengthen, not weaken, our moral and legal obligations to reunite these young people with their family members in the UK.

2019-06-28T05:00:14Z,A refugee’s story,"I looked online and immediately found the title of Jean Paul’s book (Jean Paul is not his real name). It was exactly as the judge who eventually granted him asylum had noted: anyone who wanted to check Jean Paul’s political record in his native country had only to Google his name. The book is a study of democracy and its failings in Africa. Jean Paul has also published scholarly papers on the nature of language. I met Jean Paul for the first time at the British Library, an institution devoted to the preservation of words, voices, testimony and knowledge. He told me about his experiences of flight and refuge, focusing on what he saw and heard while held in indefinite detention here in the UK. “You’ve no voice when you’re inside there,” he said. But Jean Paul does have a voice. He has a degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg and a masters from Soas University of London, and has taught for many years in London schools, with a special focus on inspiring children from ethnic minorities. It takes only a few moments in his company to understand that he has a gift for communicating gentleness, energy and enthusiasm. He is skilled at helping others to find their voice. So, I asked him, why did he want me, or anyone else, to tell his story? Wouldn’t it be more powerful coming directly from him? His response was that he needed someone else to hear, a person outside the immediate experience, to acknowledge and record what happened to him and to those whose sufferings he saw and shared. He wanted me to be his witness, not because his narrative required verification, but because of the fact of hearing itself; because it signifies that in a world that so often seeks to deny and disbelieve such accounts, his story has been absorbed by a listening heart. We talked together for hours and, as I noted down what he told me, fearful of making mistakes, I became a partner in testament to the ongoing reality of cruelty and suffering. This is an obligation to which I am deeply committed – my own parents were both refugees from Nazism at the age of 16. Researching the fate of my family taught me the importance of being a vigilant witness against evil and heartlessness, and of standing up for human solidarity, beyond all seeming borders of nationality and creed. As I listened and recorded, I became a companion in defiance against the silence in which vicious regimes try to bury the knowledge of the crimes they have committed against the dead, and disavow the living trauma of those who manage to survive them. Jean Paul needs me – us – to be allies. * * * He fled on foot with his family from the brutality of the regime in his country. During their long and exhausting trek, which lasted for 30 days, he saw many people worn out from hunger, weariness and grief. Noticing an abandoned child who no longer had the strength to walk, Jean Paul carried him on his back until he became aware that the child’s body was lifeless. After three months in exile, Jean Paul and his family were told that it was safe to return to their homeland. They took the boat back across the river to their native country, but as the crowded ferry approached the landing beach, all the young men were separated for questioning, to assess whether they might have been part of the militia fighting against government forces. Anyone suspected of belonging to such rebel groups was removed and “eliminated” without a trace. The militia in turn opened fire on the passengers, many of whom were killed. “It was chaos; people took revenge, lots were shot,” Jean Paul recalled. Four hundred people perished in the massacre. Jean Paul, his brother and their two cousins were taken away and detained for several days. He and his brother were subsequently released, but their cousins were not with them. They simply disappeared, together with many hundreds of young people. “He was with me on the boat. After we landed, I never saw him again.” Jean Paul began to work with the families of the victims, many of whom had likewise vanished; no graves were ever found. Relatives were concerned that those responsible for the killings would never be brought to justice. A collective was formed to gather together evidence of these atrocities; many of the survivors were afraid to come forward and testify, fearing that the regime would take revenge. Nevertheless, with the assistance of human rights organisations in the UK and France, enough material was assembled to force a trial at a criminal court in the summer of 2005. The judge ruled that the state was indeed responsible, but no specific individuals were deemed accountable, and the perpetrators remained unnamed. The result was that no one was brought to justice. During the course of their investigations, Jean Paul and his colleagues uncovered numerous crimes. Realising that they knew too much to be safe in a land in which tyranny and corruption were incomparably more powerful than the law, he and his close family fled to France. There, life was better. Jean Paul studied, obtaining his first degree in modern languages from the University of Strasbourg. Yet, perhaps inevitably, he always felt like an outsider. Later, Jean Paul was invited to read for an MA at Soas University of London, so moved his family to Britain and was eventually given a visa that described him as a “highly skilled migrant”. * * * Jean Paul settled down in London, working for five years at a school in Islington, supporting children from ethnic minorities and assisting in the modern languages department. He also served as a volunteer in several homelessness projects through his church and began to assemble and publish his writings. But it always remained his long-term intention “to go back home and work for my country”. He was even offered a university post there, but it was made patently clear to him he was not wanted in his home country, and that it would not be safe to return. When his father died, neither Jean Paul nor any of his brothers and sisters were able to attend the funeral. In 2015, Jean Paul therefore decided to apply for asylum in the UK. He prepared the necessary documentation with great care, including the latest United Nations information concerning his country, a report commissioned from a Stanford University professor known internationally for his research on the country, a further dossier by an expert in the UK, and an 11-page letter explaining his personal history and the circumstances underlying his application. During his appointment with the Home Office, the official who interviewed him kept interrupting him. It quickly became apparent that she had read none of the documents Jean Paul had submitted. Matters proceeded in this desultory fashion until, eventually, the woman instructed him to wait. After two hours she returned and informed Jean Paul that he was going to be detained forthwith, “for a few days, while the case is examined”. This attitude epitomises the environment of intentional hostility, the culture of disbelief, that those at the top are held to be encouraging. There is a time and a place for scepticism. But the persistent discrediting of the meticulously assembled and carefully corroborated evidence of another person’s suffering is a form of cruelty. It undermines the humanity of the victims and also of those who practise such policies. Jean Paul was taken to the detention centre at Harmondsworth. “At first it looks beautiful,” he said, “from the outside. There’s no barbed wire. But once inside, you go through a first and then a second set of security doors. You’re locked in; you can’t open them from the inside. It’s really a prison. There’s nothing to do in there.” It was very frightening. “There are some there, too, who’ve just completed sentences for serious crimes. When they’re released, they’re handed over to immigration – together with people who are simply seeking asylum.” Jean Paul’s smartphone was taken from him and replaced with a primitive device that allowed no access to the internet. For the first two days he was simply bewildered. Then he began to contact his friends. Staff at the school where he worked soon started to ask where he was and what had happened to him. His church wondered why he was missing: “Where is Jean Paul?” they wanted to know. They were baffled and confused: “No one could believe what had happened, that such a thing could occur here, in a country like Britain.” His friends had never even heard that such a place as Harmondsworth existed. They prepared an application for bail. Injured physically and mentally by his own experiences, Jean Paul was nevertheless more concerned with the sufferings of others. What about all the people who had no one on the outside to support them, who knew no one who could set in motion inquiries about why they had been taken away and where they were now being held? Who was there to help them? “I saw a man sobbing,” he told me. “He told me he’d been in the UK for three years and held in detention for six months: ‘When I was brought here my girlfriend was pregnant. Meanwhile, she’s given birth. I haven’t ever seen our baby.’ “Another man tried to kill himself twice during the two weeks I was being held. He did it out of despair. I heard he’d been inside for over a year. He didn’t know when he was going to be released or how to move his case forward. He’d had no update. He didn’t understand what it was that the authorities were waiting for. The first time, I don’t know exactly what he did. They found him hanging from the bunk bed – he must have used the sheet or something similar and tied it round his neck. He was taken to hospital. A day later he was back. “The second time, another guy from the same country was moved into his room. The new guy was on blood pressure medication; when he got a chance, he took all his new companion’s medicine to try to kill himself. The toilets weren’t private; there was only a curtain and you could see people’s feet. Someone saw that he was in there for a long time. They opened the curtains. On the floor were all the pill packs, empty. They called the medical staff; they took him to hospital, for the second time in two weeks. They soon brought him back. He had no one outside to help him. I never heard that anyone had come to visit him.” * * * Jean Paul explained that the Home Office periodically required inmates to sign a standard letter agreeing to their continued detention on the basis that they could not be released because they had insufficient connections and support in London. The Home Office understood this as authorising them to keep the signatories in detention indefinitely. “I saw everyone in front of me sign. But they didn’t understand the contents of the letter. ‘Have you read it?’ I asked one man. ‘No, I can’t read English,’ he said. “When my own turn came, I tried to read the letter first. ‘Why can’t you just sign?’ the lady insisted. I went out for 15 minutes and read the document. I came back and told her I wasn’t signing. ‘You have to,’ she said. ‘It’s just our routine.’ ‘No, I don’t,’ I replied. I’d been living in London for 10 years; I refused to sign. I asked the lady what had happened to my file. The administration isn’t fit for purpose. “One man told me how he’d been in and out of detention for two years. For the last couple of months inside, he’d heard nothing about his case. ‘I’m going back to my home country,’ he said. He’d had enough; he was giving up. They wear people down until they lose hope and agree to be deported.” Jean Paul was allocated a duty solicitor and a different official was sent from the Home Office to interview him. He again gave his statement. The Home Office official explained that his application had been refused. “They make a decision, then you have the right to appeal,” Jean Paul explained. He prepared the appeal himself: “If you can’t write out your case for yourself, your solicitor can’t do anything, as he or she has at least 50 other people to deal with.” Meanwhile, Jean Paul became ill; the removal centre was so dusty and dirty that he began to cough. “They pay people £1 an hour to clean,” he said – less than a tenth of the London living wage. One day, he coughed up blood. This really frightened him, so he reported to the doctor who came to Harmondsworth twice a week. He was taken to the infirmary, where he was kept in isolation, suspected of having tuberculosis. He had to wear a mask and was not allowed out. After three days, he had still been given no medicine, not even paracetamol; he was simply left to sit all day in the sick bay, waiting. But conditions were better in there; he had a room with a toilet and a small TV. Eventually, he was asked to do a spittle test, which came back inconclusive. A second, and finally a third test, proved negative. Still, Jean Paul had to attend his appeal hearing in a mask. When the judge asked him why he was wearing such an item, he explained that he was suspected of having TB. The judge, who was perceptive and well intentioned, observed that this was a “very complicated case which couldn’t be decided in a day”. Jean Paul recalled: “She looked at me and said: ‘I don’t see any reason why this person is here. This complex case has been mismanaged. Go home and I’ll write to you.’” She promised to contact him within three months and ordered his immediate release. She added that a copy of his book would be required for his future hearing, as well as an expert report on his native country. It took Jean Paul two further days to secure his release. In the meantime, he was brought back to the medical centre. “All that time nothing happened,” he said. He called his solicitor, who merely said: “Oh, are you still there?” The medical staff had no idea what was supposed to happen next. Security staff claimed that they had received no notification about him being released. He had no choice but to stay a further night in detention while he tried to trace for himself who it was who was supposed to be responsible for organising his release. “I was in detention for just two weeks and it had an impact on my mental health,” he said. “What about those who were in there for six months?” The Home Office informed Jean Paul that he was henceforth not allowed to work. Unable to earn any money for himself, Jean Paul was dependent on his friends, who proved unstinting in their support. They made good on their offer to provide him accommodation for free. They looked after him with care and devotion, and raised the money to appoint him a good solicitor. But the anticipated letter never arrived. “They’d discovered their mistake,” Jean Paul commented. Eventually the solicitor called the Home Office, only to be informed that they had no record of him ever being in detention. “They erased everything, to obliterate their error,” Jean Paul said. “That upset me more than anything else. I was the victim of a bureaucratic system where no one cares; where the decision is made beforehand and no one can be bothered.” After three months, Jean Paul was given a date to attend an appeal tribunal. Once again, he carefully prepared the latest and most updated reports about his home country. He included letters of reference from his former employers at the school, from the priest of the church where he volunteered, as well as from a friend working at the Foreign Office. He included a copy of his book and his other writings, as the judge at Harmondsworth had advised. On the day itself, he came accompanied by his British girlfriend, his friend from the Foreign Office and his priest, who brought his wife and his guide dog with him. It proved to be a theatre of the absurd. The court appointed an interpreter, even though Jean Paul spoke and wrote excellent English and held two degrees in modern languages. The Home Office solicitor had neither read, nor even possessed copies of, any of the new documents. The judge deferred the proceedings for 30 minutes and provided her with the materials. She then proceeded to ask ridiculous questions, based on an outdated 2007 report, when Jean Paul had provided the most recent 2015 findings. “The Home Office hadn’t even updated its information online,” Jean Paul said. She asked Jean Paul questions about his native country’s rating, which should have been well-known to the Home Office; it ranked among the highest ever assigned for persecution, lawlessness and violence. She declared in conclusion: “Since a previous trial had been held, justice surely had no doubt been done.” Jean Paul was left in tears. The judge brought the proceedings to a close with the pronouncement that she was not going to make her decision on the spot. She would make it known within the following two weeks. In her letter, which followed soon afterwards, she gave Jean Paul leave to remain in the UK until 2020, noting that this had been granted on the basis of “the evidence provided”, with the added observations that “one had only to type the referent’s name into Google to see that he would be arrested at once if he returned to his native country”, and that, “if he ever went back, even for a visit, he’d certainly have to change it.” The tribunal determined that the case would be kept anonymous, purportedly on account of its sensitivity. “But was this the genuine reason?” wondered Jean Paul. “Or was it not rather that the Home Office was trying to cover up its confusion and erase the traces of the mess it had made?” * * * I asked Jean Paul if he thought the system was cruel, callous, careless or just plain chaotic. “The problem with the Home Office,” he said, “is that you never see the same person twice. The next man or woman doesn’t know your case; there’s no real follow-up. The system is overloaded.” The staff themselves, he acknowledged, were as varied as anywhere else: some were unfeeling, some couldn’t care, some were genuinely kind. Had he pursued the reasons why his papers went missing? No, he had not. He had started a new job in Whitechapel; he had become engaged and hoped to be married the following summer. “My life has moved on since then,” he said. Looking back was evidently too painful, and, at this juncture, pointless. It had taken six months to return to normal life. But his experiences had left him with nightmares. “And I had friends on the outside to help me,” he said. “Many of the people in there had nobody, not a soul to speak on their behalf.” In the UK, people don’t disappear in massacres or acts of terror committed by the government or by militias that everyone knows are implicated but no one has the power and authority to indict. That is why Britain and similar democracies are not places from which persecuted people generally long to escape. Their longstanding humanitarian tradition, their reputation for tolerance, and the widespread rule of law make them islands of refuge from state-sponsored murder and mass violence. People don’t vanish into hidden mass graves. But there are other ways of disappearing: when you’ve got no voice; when, even if you have, those around you don’t, or won’t, find the time to listen; when they lack the will to hear you in their conscience, or the compassion to care about you in their hearts. You don’t go missing – only your files do, and your presence in the thoughts of those who ought to care, and the record of the experiences that hurt you, and that drove others to despair.

2019-12-12T11:00:05Z,The Bikes of Wrath review – cyclists take the dustbowl migrants' road,"As bike touring booms, we’ve seen a trickle of documentaries by cyclists filming their adventures on helmet cameras. This one, from Australian director Cameron Ford, is slicker than most. In 2015, Ford and four friends cycled 2,600 miles in 30 days across the US in the footsteps of John Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, following the route of dustbowl migrants searching for a better life. The five men travelled on a budget of $420, the equivalent of the $18 an average depression-era family had to get them to California. This creates the slightly queasy sight of affluent guys in expensive Patagonia T-shirts slumming it and relying on the kindness of strangers – some of whom are themselves clearly only just scraping by on low incomes. Ford and his buddies are a good-natured bunch, endearingly honest and unmacho about their limited cycling experience; one admits he’s never cycled more than 20km. Their plan is to busk for their supper. But, as they pedal through the Bible belt it’s kindness and hospitality all the way: guys in cowboy hats and belt buckles offering a hot meal or a bed or barn for the night to this group of tattooed man-bunned hipsters. In the strongest scenes their hosts read extracts from The Grapes of Wrath, still so contemporary, still burning with injustice; and we see some of the extraordinary photographs of America in poverty by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. But the film’s journalistic ambition to examine inequality today – an update of Steinbeck for the 21st century – doesn’t come off. Ford and his mates seem like chill guys; so there’s not much white-hot wrath here. And despite the superior production values, sometimes The Bikes of Wrath feels a bit like watching a home video by someone you’ve never met on their holiday of a lifetime. • The Bikes of Wrath is released in the UK on 13 December."
2019-10-13T17:52:30Z,A minefield for both UK and EU migrants | Letters,"Amelia Gentleman’s piece on claiming EU settled status (The long read, 8 October) was helpful and revealing but overlooked the organisation that is probably best placed to steer claimants through the process: Citizens Advice. I am a volunteer adviser and have seen for myself how complicated a business it can be, especially for older people. My conclusion is: don’t try this at home – unless you are very computer-literate. We have far more branches than there are local authorities, and as long as clients have brought all the necessary bits and pieces, they can often get the job done on a single visit. It would benefit a large number of people if you could publicise this. Les Masters Bleadon, Somerset • To add to the debate about the status of EU citizens in the UK, the British government has just seen fit to write individually to all of its citizens resident in Europe and in receipt of UK state pensions, thus entitling us to reciprocal healthcare rights in our country of residence. This missive informs us that our healthcare will only continue to be funded by the UK until the end of next year and that our pensions will only receive index-linked increases until 2023. This is, supposedly, to allow us time to make arrangements. How is this justified? We have all paid our taxes, so why are we suddenly to be deprived of medical services and expected to stretch our meagre pensions even further? Few of us could remotely afford private medical insurance. We hope that our host countries will be considerate enough to continue our medical care – but this will mean they are doing so without any contributions from HMG, which leaves us in a precarious position and subject to the differing priorities of changing governments.

2019-12-10T19:12:00Z,Liverpool back calls for investigations into migrant worker deaths in Qatar,"Liverpool have supported calls by human rights groups for thorough investigations into the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar, before the club flies to the Gulf country next week to play in Fifa’s Club World Cup. The Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, has also sought assurances from the Qatar “supreme committee”, which is organising the tournament and the 2022 World Cup, about the progress of investigations into the deaths of two men who had been working on the construction of football stadiums. Moore set out Liverpool’s position in a letter to Nicholas McGeehan and James Lynch, directors of the Fair/Square human rights organisation, who asked him in November to make a public statement of concern about workers’ rights and deaths in Qatar. They highlighted the risks of the intense heat and humidity for people employed on the vast construction projects in the Gulf, citing medical research published in July into deaths of Nepalese workers in Qatar, which concluded that “the increased cardiovascular mortality during hot periods most likely is due to severe heat stress”. McGeehan and Lynch specifically highlighted the death in June of Rupchandra Rumba, 24, a Nepali who died in his lodgings during his period of employment as a scaffolder at the Education City stadium, which was originally designated for Liverpool to play their matches. Rumba’s Qatari death certificate, as is common in the country, attributed his death to a generalised “acute cardio-respiratory failure due to natural causes”, which McGeehan and Lynch described as “not a certifiable cause of death, meaning that Rumpchandra’s death remains unexplained”. McGeehan, formerly Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Lynch, previously a deputy director at Amnesty, have called for full investigations into the deaths in Qatar and the effects of heat. They cited the climate data and conclusions of medical experts, reported by the Guardian in October, that hundreds of migrant workers are dying in Qatar every year due to heat stress. Moore said in his reply that Liverpool had “sought background detail assurances” from the supreme committee about the status of the investigation into Rumba’s death and the progress of compensation for Rumba’s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, and their six-year-old son, Niraj. After Liverpool’s designated venue was moved to the Khalifa International stadium Moore said they had also discussed with the supreme committee the ongoing investigation headed by Sir Robert Akenhead into the death in January 2017 of the British construction worker Zac Cox, who fell from rigging at that stadium. “Like any responsible organisation, we support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve,” Moore wrote in his reply to McGeehan and Lynch. “Furthermore we also believe that employees should be treated with fairness and respect, which is why we adhere to our own anti-slavery policy and why we are committed to paying the real living wage, among various measures of this kind. These are the standards that we set for ourselves and by which we would hope to be judged given they fall within our own remits and responsibilities. “Nevertheless, we remain a sporting organisation and it is important that we are not drawn into global issues on the basis of where our involvement in various competitions dictates that our fixtures take place. So while we respect and understand the reasons why you have sought a public pronouncement from us, we hope you will respect and understand why we feel such a course of action would not be appropriate. “Having already stated that while we do not visit any country with the objective of bringing about change, but any resultant positive changes would be welcomed, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that particular message.” McGeehan told the Guardian that he welcomed Liverpool’s intervention: “In their detailed expression of support for investigations into worker deaths and compensation for families, Liverpool have demonstrated more clarity of thought than Fifa and all of their sponsors put together,” he said."
2019-01-15T14:25:07Z,EU seeks temporary deal over refugees and migrants rescued at sea,"The European Union is attempting to agree on a temporary deal on the handling of migrants and refugees rescued at sea, after a push for wide-ranging reforms before the European elections failed to win support. Diplomats are studying plans from the European commission for a temporary mechanism to manage rescue boats, after a series of incidents in which vessels were unable to dock in any Mediterranean port. The latest case concerned 49 people who were at sea for almost three weeks onboard two German NGO ships, SeaWatch 3 and Sea Eye. They were allowed to disembark in Malta after a deal was struck to disperse them among eight EU member states. Speaking in the European parliament on Tuesday, the European commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the incident was shameful and called for an end to “unorganised ad-hoc solutions”. A spokeswoman said: “The commission stands ready to work with member states in order to set up temporary arrangements that can ensure solidarity with the most exposed EU countries, which can serve as a bridge until the new Dublin regulation becomes applicable.” The Dublin regulation is a draft EU asylum law that has stalled over proposed quotas to distribute asylum seekers around the bloc. EU legislators – ministers and MEPs – have given up hope of a breakthrough before European elections in May. The latest idea for a temporary fix would not include quotas, nor prejudge decisions on the Dublin regulation, according to one EU source. Elements could include EU funds to return refused asylum claimants to their home countries. The plan has backing from around 10 member states, including France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, but has run into opposition from Hungary, which argues that the policy would encourage more people to attempt the sea crossing. The commission said it was not searching for unanimity but for a “critical mass of countries” to get the plan off the ground. Avramopoulos held separate meetings with Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, and prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, in Rome on Monday to discuss the plans. The commissioner described the meeting as constructive; the Italian government has yet to comment. Since Salvini closed Italian ports to NGO rescue boats last summer, EU countries have been scrambling to come up with ad-hoc arrangements whenever a vessel is stranded. The delays are seen as adding to the distress of those onboard and damaging to the EU’s credibility. “From a political perspective, with every crisis that occurs in the Mediterranean the political leverage of the EU is diminishing rapidly,” said Hanne Beirens, an associate director at the Migration Policy Institute in Brussels. She said the EU’s growing resistance to people coming from Syria had prompted other governments to question whether they should help. “We saw third countries that have been traditionally hosting a lot of refugees, in the Middle East or Kenya, becoming really resistant [and asking]: ‘OK, why should we continue to do this and should we not get more financial help?’” Numbers of people crossing the Mediterranean has fallen sharply since the peak of the crisis, although Spain has seen a surge in arrivals. Beirens said these relatively low numbers could reduce the incentive to reach an agreement, but that a coalition of “the usual suspects” could strike a deal. France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland have typically been among the countries volunteering to take in refugees. “I expect that de facto there will be some kind of operational agreement because [officials] cannot spend days on the phone each time,” she said. “The question is how long it takes those ad-hoc arrangements to become more long-lasting.”"
2019-12-29T19:13:31Z,Pregnant woman among 31 migrants rescued trying to cross Channel,"A pregnant woman was among 31 migrants who had to be rescued after attempting to cross the Channel overnight. French coastguard officers rescued the migrants after the engine of one small boat cut out and another began to take in water, authorities in France said on Sunday. Several attempted crossings have been intercepted recently, including on Boxing Day when 49 suspected migrants from Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan were escorted to British shores after a search and rescue operation. In the latest incident, the Home Office said, French coastguard officers picked up 11 people, including two young children, after the engine failed in their small boat off the coast near Calais in the early hours of Sunday. Another 20, including the pregnant woman, were later rescued by the same patrol boat further along the French coast near Dunkirk after their small boat took in water, local authorities said in a statement. A number of those rescued were being treated for hypothermia, with all 31 taken to the French port where they were met by medics and border police. A third vessel carrying a group of 10 men and one woman claiming to be from Iran was also intercepted off the coast of Kent at 5.34am. HM Coastguard said two Border Force boats brought the migrants to shore. They were being medically assessed before being transferred to immigration officials for interviews. The figure for the number of suspected migrants to reach the UK this year in small boats is believed to be more than 1,800 with 79 people picked up on 4 December and 69 taken in on 17 December. The rescues reflect a renewed effort to try to stop migrant crossings. The Home Office said last week that patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed. In a statement they said: “Illegal migration is a criminal activity. Those who seek to come to the UK unlawfully and the ruthless criminals who facilitate journeys are all breaking the law and endangering lives. “We will always ensure we have the right resources in place to keep our border secure. A 42-metre Border Force cutter and two coastal patrol vessels are patrolling the Channel and we are monitoring the situation closely over the Christmas and new year period.” Since January 2019, more than 125 migrants who entered the UK illegally via small boats have been returned to Europe, according to government figures."

2019-04-15T10:43:31Z,Fear and despair engulf refugees in Libya's 'market of human beings',"On the roofs of the highest buildings in Tajoura, a military complex and migrant detention centre in southern Tripoli, snipers are taking position. “Tonight nobody will sleep because of fear,” said a refugee locked up there. “We can hear the sound of guns and explosion of bombs very close to the detention centre.” Scores of people died in fighting in Libya since the renegade military leader General Khalifa Haftar ordered his Libyan National Army forces to advance on the capital, where the UN-backed Government of National Accord sits, earlier this month. On Monday Ghassan Salamé, the UN’s special envoy for Libya, accused Haftar of mounting a coup attempt. As the fighters controlling Tajoura prepare for a showdown, some of the hundreds of refugees and migrants inside the complex, and in other detention centres across Tripoli, are worried that they will become victims and targets, after they were forced to take an active role supporting militias aligned with the GNA. Compelling detained refugees and migrants to support fighters could constitute a war crime. Since Haftar’s advance began on 4 April, migrants and refugees in three detention centres have told the Guardian they were taken out of locked halls and ordered to carry and move weapons, with some transferred to military bases around the city. In a fourth centre, detainees said people had been taken away by fighters, but they don’t know what’s happened to them. “The police and soldiers force migrants to do cleaning work and load weapons. They [tell] migrants that if you know how to shoot a gun we will make you stay with us,” said one migrant who messaged the Guardian using a hidden phone. The Guardian has also been sent photos of migrants wearing what appear to be military uniforms. “We even washed the cars that were full with the blood of the soldiers who were killed on the war front,” said another detainee. “They put the dead bodies in the military cars. I’m not feeling good but I don’t have a choice here.” “Forcing civilians to stockpile weapons in a warzone counts as abusive forced labour, is unlawfully cruel, and puts them at unnecessary risk,” said Judith Sunderland, associate director for the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Making them wear uniforms suggests they are being used as hostages or human shields, both of which are war crimes.” “Far from pressing detained migrants into these dangerous activities, all parties should be taking all possible measures to avoid civilian casualties. The authorities should release all migrants who are arbitrarily detained and ensure their safety.” About 6,000 refugees and migrants are currently locked up in detention centres ostensibly under the control of Libya’s directorate for combating illegal migration, which is associated with the government of Fayez al-Sarraj. In reality, however, many of the centres are run by militias. The directorate did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The roughly 600 detainees in Tajoura are among tens of thousands of men, women, and children who have been intercepted in the Mediterranean sea trying to reach Europe over the past two years, and brought back to indefinite detention. The EU is spending tens of millions of euros to train, fund, and equip the Libyan coastguard, in a bid to decrease migration from Africa. “They know what is going on in the Libyan detention centres but the EU pretend like they don’t know,” said one detainee. “Libya is not the right place or safe place for refugees and migrants to stay. They should stop bringing back those who tried to cross the sea.” A detainee in another Tripoli centre said: “Libya is a market of human beings. People are still working by slaving in Libya, so how can people stay in Libya?” Before the escalation of fighting over the past 11 days, more than a dozen current and former detainees spoke to the Guardian about their experiences of forced labour. Sometimes they worked for Libyan guards in the detention centres, and sometimes for people associated with them, including relatives. Refugees and migrants said they have cleaned houses, constructed buildings and toiled on farms. “As a detainee it is a great opportunity [to] escape the stuffy prison, or at least you got to see the sun and also fresh air while working enslaved,” said an Eritrean who was caught at sea in May 2018, and escaped to Tunisia at the end of last year. Women didn’t have to leave the centres to work but some minors did, he said. “Even underage [people] go to that enslaving labour.” Detainees had been forced to work for four or five months straight, another man claimed, saying he had built houses for guards working for the directorate for combating illegal migration. “If I stop working or take a rest they will start shouting in a threatening way that scares me … If migrants try to escape, they’re going to shoot them.” Sometimes workers are rewarded with cigarettes, bread or vegetables, but sometimes they get nothing, he said. The prevalence of forced labour in Libyan migrant detention centres has been confirmed by other sources, including Human Rights Watch and the UN. A report by the UN human rights office, released in December, said investigators had documented testimonies of forced labour in six detention centres between 2017 and 2018, including Tajoura and Triq al Sikka, which lies further north in Tripoli. In October last year, a 28-year-old Somali man set himself alight in Triq al Sikka after dousing himself with petrol from a generator he accessed while working, according to witnesses. Abdulaziz felt hopeless about his chances of evacuation, friends said. The International Organization for Migration and the UN refugee agency confirmed the death. A few months ago, another refugee described being made to work in a weapons store. “One day I have gone to work there. They have different weapons such as tanks with their rockets, and different bombs.”"
2019-12-05T07:36:33Z,UN refugee agency condemns medevac repeal – as it happened,"Rightio. Stick a fork in me. Done. The House and the Senate have adjourned. That’s the end of another sitting year. It’s been a rollercoaster. Thankfully, I’ve only been trapped on it for the past week. That’s been more than enough, let me assure you. Loyal readers, thank you so much for sticking with us throughout. Just want to pay tribute to the incredible Amy Remeikis, Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. Feeding this beast is an almighty effort. This week’s blog will have been a window into the steady disintegration of my mind. But it’s only been four days. Amy and co do it all year. Just to recap the day’s events. Angus Taylor decided to double down on his fight with *checks notes* Naomi Wolf, calling for her to apologise for inferring he was antisemitic after he inferred she was at war with Christmas during their Oxford years. Wolf also doubled down, saying Taylor had his facts wrong and was peddling divisive lies about her. The government rammed its union bashing bill through the lower house this morning, gagging debate, and causing outrage all round by not letting the opposition speak on the bill. Anthony Albanese likened it to totalitarianism. Scott Morrison said unions were full of thugs, so who cares. There was continuing fallout to the repeal of medevac. Human rights groups continued to criticise the decision and Labor and the Greens continued to demand an explanation of Jacqui Lambie’s deal with the government. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said her offer of resettlement was still on the table but said Australia had not approached her government for talks in recent days. Morrison announced a raft of machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 18 to 14 and getting rid of five departmental secretaries. The overhaul was criticised for concentrating power and undermining the cabinet system. It also saw the promotion of Andrew Metcalfe, Morrison’s old immigration secretary. Thanks again. Merry Christmas from the blog. Stay safe. The UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has released a statement expressing its disappointment at the repeal of the medevac legislation on Wednesday. It has also urged the government to accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees. “Since its commencement earlier this year, the medevac mechanism had proven to be a timely, effective and often life-saving safeguard,” the agency said in a statement. “After more than six years of uncertainty regarding solutions, UNHCR is extremely concerned that the health situation of asylum seekers and refugees will continue to deteriorate. “In the absence of the now repealed medevac mechanisms, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to continue utilising pre-existing legislative processes in a good faith effort to evacuate individuals in need of urgent medical treatment. “As Australia retains responsibility for people forcibly transferred under its offshore arrangements, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to find appropriate solutions including taking up the longstanding offer by New Zealand to resettle refugees and to prevent further harm.” In spillover Senate estimates, jobs department officials have revealed that businesses which take a jobseeker on in a PaTH internship do not need to host for the full four weeks to be paid $1,000 for the placement – only five days. The top five businesses providing PaTH internships are: Yacoub family trust, AHS hospitality, Coles, Woolworths and Hog’s Breath Café. Officials said the employment rate (that is, the proportion of interns who get proper employment at the end of the placement) for those five businesses is 53.8%, compared with 60.8% for all providers offering more than 10 internships. Anthony Albanese gives his version of the love-in speech. He signs it off with: As Naomi Wolf would say, have a lovely Christmas. Better things are happening in the Senate. Trust me. Scott Morrison is summing up the year in the lower house as we reach the end of the sitting year. He thanks the public for returning the Coalition to government and speaks of the great challenges Australians have faced in terms of natural disasters this year. This is the time when everyone pretends to be nice to everyone else. So that we all leave with warm fuzzy feelings in our hearts. Yay. Scott Morrison says to Anthony Albanese: It is also fitting of this time of the year to extend to the leader of the opposition and his family my very best wishes for Christmas and the holiday season. Whether he’ll be watching re-runs of old footy games or I’ll be, who knows. But I do hope he has a wonderful Christmas and New Year period with his family... and a bit of rest. Haha, yeah. Who knows? No one’s watching old footy re-runs. Don’t be ridiculous. Labor’s Mark Butler is pointing out the bizarre nature of Angus Taylor’s statement on Naomi Wolf in parliament today. He tells the ABC: I’m not sure who knows better than her where she was in 1991. Instead Angus Taylor doubled down, he not only said she was there in 1991. He told question time that she’d been there since the mid-1980s until a few years ago. The Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman and the Labor MP Anne Aly are on the ABC. They’re asked whether they think question time today was an edifying display. Spoiler alert: nah, it wasn’t. Zimmerman says it’s the name calling and the heat that people object to. I think question time generally is something most Australians struggle to come to terms with. Aly says it fails at its core objective of actually getting answers. I’m in that category of people who had never watched question time before I came to parliament. I went into my first question time with a pen and paper thinking we were actually going to get answers. Wolf says she had never heard of Taylor before three days ago. I’ve never met this man. I didn’t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. Particularly at the time of her book’s release: Respectfully to Mr Taylor, I wasn’t paying attention to him, whoever he is. She’s asked if there’s a stalemate. I didn’t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It’s up to him as an elected official to correct the record. Wolf: As a woman, I find it objectionable that I’m having to document my entire life.... he should apologise and more importantly, this is not about me, he should correct the record. She sticks to her guns on the charge of antisemitism. I do think that’s antisemitic. I stand by what I said. She says the comments were clearly religiously divisive and false. Wolf responds to Taylor’s statement that his grandmother is Jewish. I mean, respectfully, I’m glad he comes from such a diverse family. As I said earlier, I have no argument with his family. I do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn’t, doing something I wasn’t doing. She insists she was not in Oxford, despite Angus Taylor’s repeated claim that he remembers meeting her there. She holds up a list of the bookseller list for that year, and it shows her book at No 13. She also refers to a friend who can confirm she was not in Oxford that year. I shouldn’t have to identify where I was. He has said things that are completely, provably wrong. There are multiple eyewitnesses. Naomi Wolf has conducted an interview with the ABC. She said her phone call with Angus Taylor’s office was not “heated”, but was firm. I think that I was firmly requesting a correction because Angus Taylor has made statements about me in very public forums misstating that I was among graduate students at Oxford in 1991 who were campaigning against Christmas. She says a profile in the Australian Financial Review on Taylor, which repeated the claim, is currently being corrected by the newspaper. I wasn’t there in 1991, I was in New York, I had written what many people think is a very important feminist text. I was touring all over the world with it... and I’ve never campaigned against Christmas. She continues: I really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story. Wolf responds to Taylor’s attack in parliament today. Taylor asked her to apologise for calling him antisemitic. She says: I have to say I’m quite taken aback by what you’re telling me. I think it’s very inappropriate, and very wrong. The government’s plans to merge the family court have hit a bit of a snag. The proposal to merge the federal and federal circuit courts was condemned by the Law Council of Australia and other legal groups which warned earlier this week that it risked “victims of family violence falling through the cracks”. The Senate has set a reporting date on the legislation by November 2020. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says this has “effectively put a one-year hold” on the plan. Dreyfus: Mr Porter stunned many in the family court sector in May last year when he announced plans to destroy the family court on the basis of a six-week desktop review by a firm of consultants. Earlier this year, a comprehensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission – which the government commissioned and is still to respond to – totally contradicted the attorney general by recommending the creation of an entirely new court system and greater specialisation in the family law system. The Morrison government has not responded to that ALRC report. Instead Mr Porter reached agreement with One Nation to hold yet another inquiry into the family law system. Albanese moves on to Angus Taylor. He wonders whether the Naomi Wolf scandal might “get up on TV tonight”. I think it might, I think it might. Because the extraordinary attack on Naomi Wolf, who was in New York, not a roomie, at college in the United Kingdom at the time. At that very year she had the number one bestselling book in the world! Like, this wasn’t someone obscure, and what did he do? He ripped into her. Nothing to see here. She should apologise. To him! to him! Like he’s the victim... and this prime minister keeps running a protection racket for this bloke. It is the witness protection program that this man has. Question time ends. Anthony Albanese leaps up to speak. He says Scott Morrison is acting as though he’s been on a “victory lap” since the election and had won 100% of the vote. We’re not a one-party state, he says. This is a democracy. This is the greatest jackboot administration that we have seen, and today in sacking five departmental heads, what they have also done is centralised power at the centre. Because when you have multiple cabinet ministers with a single department... all power gets centralised to prime minister and cabinet. The fact is that this government regards democracy as an inconvenience, one that can be dismissed at any time. Things are deteriorating here. Lots of anger, lots of bile. Lots of insults followed by withdrawals. Urgh. Pull the plug already. Mark Butler turns the attack to Angus Taylor. He asks a question that mentions allegations Taylor lied about going to Oxford with the US author Naomi Wolf, who Taylor spoke about in the context of students warring on Christmas and wanting to remove a Christmas tree from their common room. Taylor comes out swinging. He reckons he did see Wolf at Oxford, despite her saying she was on the other side of the world at the time. Of course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there. She began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago. Now my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas. I want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations. The fact that the Labor party has attached itself to antisemitic accusations shows just how low they’re prepared to go. The last bit provokes uproar. Anthony Albanese wants him to withdraw the accusation that Labor is antisemitic, which didn’t really make any logical sense. Taylor withdraws. Morrison continues: I understand the leader of the opposition is very angry, Mr Speaker, and he’s angry because the government is standing up for those who don’t want to see thuggery and bullying in their workplace, particularly against women, Mr Speaker. He accuses Labor of attempting to attack his faith, which prompts uproar from Labor. Morrison: That’s what you did, that’s what you did. Tony Burke is furious and says that attack is “very personal” and should be withdrawn. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, asks Scott Morrison why he doesn’t believe in integrity and accountability, before rattling off a series of examples. The treatment of the union bill this morning, misleading parliament, his phone call over the NSW police investigation into Angus Taylor, why he was sacked as chief executive of Tourism Australia, and why he invited Brian Houston to the White House. The question prompts shouts of “smear”, “smear”, “no policy” and “muckraking” from the government benches. Morrison repeats a line from earlier this week. This is question time, it’s not smear time. Tanya Plibersek asks why Scott Morrison has lied about reducing funding for Tafe. He responds: As the member would know, funding for Tafe is provided by state and territory governments ... so the member can’t come and say things that are simply untrue. Scott Morrison is asked a question on what he is doing to increase the number of nurses in aged care facilities. I will take that matter up, and make sure I get an answer, Mr Speaker. He speaks about the aged care royal commission. It is very distressing what was reported in that report, and as that report reflected this deals with issues that have been endemic that have been in the aged care sector for a very long time and the government is seeking to address the issues in aged care, which are serious and substantial. Morrison says they are increasing the number of aged care places, and reducing the use of chemical restraints and the number of young people ending up in care. A couple of economic questions from Labor. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asks why we have falling investment, a weakening economy, flat wages and rising unemployment, when the government promised to build a stronger economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg: The shadow treasurer referred to investment. I can confirm that under the Coalition that investment outside of the mining sector has increased 34% since we’ve come to office, or over 5% per year. Now under the Labor party, investment outside of the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Heaps of gesticulating for the dixers. Andrew Laming giving it a red hot animated go with his “down, down, Labor debt down” line to Josh Frydenberg. Albanese asks again about the government’s rushing through of the union-busting bill this morning without debate. Why does this prime minister not respect the democratic process? Morrison says the bill was debated extensively last week. This issue, this matter of dealing with thuggish, militant unionism is something the Australian people wanted us to address. We stand up for what we believe in. This matter has been through this place before, it’s been up in the Senate before. It went through some 15 or 16 hours of debate in the other place, Mr Speaker. He continues: I will stand up against thugs, Mr Speaker. The Labor party stands up for thugs. Last day of school vibes going on here. Couple of Labor MPs have been booted, including Joel Fitzgibbon. Michael McCormack leaps up. He’s had a running war with Fitzgibbon all week. Well the average IQ of the chamber just went up, see you Joel, have a nice Christmas mate. Albanese asks the prime minister, Scott Morrison, why he has failed to bring on legislation following the banking royal commission but broke precedents to ram through the union-busting legislation this morning. Morrison said: I introduced the laws that ensured the banking executives who did the wrong thing should be punted forever. That’s what I did, Mr Speaker, and those opposite sought to frustrate it. He said “ugly militant unionism should have no place in this country”. Morrison gets a tough one from his backbenches. Australia is the best country in the world, as we all know, so tell us why you’re so great etc etc. Question time is upon us. Anthony Albanese says the government won’t support freedom of speech, won’t support freedom to protest and now won’t support debate in parliament. He refers to the union-busting legislation that was pushed through the lower house without debate. When the prime minister talks about quiet Australians, doesn’t he actually mean silent Australians? Morrison says: On the night of the election, I thanked all those Australians who go about their lives honestly decently with their aspirations. They’re the Australians our government spoke directly to, Mr Speaker. Morrison says Albanese has spent his political career focussed on the “bubble of this place” and the “tawdry drama of Canberra”. The mystery of the missing bills, by Mike Bowers. OK, I’m calling it. Speech of the week goes to Tim Watts. Hands down. Watts is the Labor MP who last week tweeted about Angus Taylor’s first speech and its references to Naomi Wolf and a plot to remove a Christmas tree from their Oxford common room. The US author has since slammed Taylor’s speech as wildly inaccurate and ethnically divisive. “The response was, well, unexpected,” he says. “It was a cautionary tale straight [from] Aesop’s Fables that summed up the minister’s career to date. You could call it: the boy who cried Wolf.” I’ll let Watts, who read from a mock book of fairy tales, do the rest. Here’s how it goes. Once there was a grasslands boy who wanted to be prime minister. One day for no comprehensible reason, the boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, there’s a Wolf trying to steal Christmas’. But when people looked, there was no wolf. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a man from Yass, a man from Yass, a man from Yass asked me to protect my grasslands from meddling environmental regulation’. But when the people looked, there was no man from Yass. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor spending millions of dollars on flights’. But when the people looked, there was no junketeering mayor. One day, the boy who wanted to be prime minister was lying in his grasslands when a taskforce Garrad came upon him. The boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘a smear, a smear, a smear’. But when the people looked, there was no smear. One day, the boy who cried Wolf will tell the truth. But well, that bit hasn’t happened here yet. But if you believe in fairy tales, maybe one day it will. Labor is moving a motion saying the government’s attempts to push the union-busting bill through without debate was “anti-democratic”. Better still is this bit of the motion: This is a prime ministerial tantrum, with the prime minister of Australia behaving like a juvenile schoolyard bully just because he didn’t get his way last week. Yeah, dunno, but not sure the government will go for this one. We’re now moving through the votes for the government’s union-busting bill. The Community and Public Sector Union, the main union representing public servants, said the changes announced by the prime minister today will do nothing to enhance service delivery. The union says the major review of the public service, conducted by David Thodey, did not suggest creating new super departments, and instead suggested the opposite. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: It is clear that the prime minister is out of ideas. First he borrowed Services Australia from the NSW government, now super-departments. Moving buildings and merging departments does not fix the service crisis created by his own government. We know that since 2013 18,908 or 11.4% of public service jobs have been cut under successive Liberal governments, causing enormous damage to the capacity of the commonwealth to deliver policy and essential services that all Australians rely upon. This change will not do anything to address the 48 million unanswered calls to DHS in 2017/2018 or the further 5.3 million calls abandoned out of frustration. These are not the actions of a good government. This won’t change the delays in the family court, and it won’t change the challenges our CSIRO face. Rightio. Well, now the speaker has done a bit of digging. And it turns out there were in fact copies of the bills in the House, despite all of that. Speaker Tony Smith says: I’ve been able to ascertain some facts, I realise emotions are running high. I can report that notwithstanding the view ... that there were no bills present. That was not correct. I have checked. There were bills present. I’m not going to have an argument about this. Prior to the ringing of the bells there were 25 copies, Smith says. Another 40 copies were being brought in. More were being printed. Enough for everyone! Mike Bowers captured the government benches as they attempted to gag debate and pass union-busting legislation on the last sitting day of the year. He’s still in the chamber and tells me the clerks and attendants are running around, pointing at to a pile on the desk, and saying they were there all along. Anthony Albanese is responding to that mess in the House as we speak. This is a prime minister who doesn’t want scrutiny from the media, he doesn’t want scrutiny from the parliament either. And we’ve seen this today. Albanese likens the government’s actions to a “totalitarian state”. We have now had the parliament shut down because the government is incapable of running a basic democratic process. Here they run in, they gag debate, they refuse to allow anyone to speak, to push through legislation. To what end? So that they can make a point that even though they lost in the Senate last week, they won in the House today. Right, well, that was a bit of a circus. My head is still spinning. Just to recap: the government sought to move quickly on its union-busing legislation this morning, suspending usual business to get straight to it. then it tried to gag debate in a way Tony Burke described as “unprecedented”. then the vote was called. But the opposition said it had not seen a copy of the bill it was supposed to be voting on. The government said there were copies in the chamber, but Labor insisted it hasn’t seen them. it prompted uproar. Labor are and were outraged. All the while, MPs are unable to stand to speak during the division, so they’re sitting down with pieces of paper or books on their head as a signal they have the call. Speaker Tony Smith considers the issue momentarily. He decides that, yes, people probably should have access to copies of the legislation they are voting on. Fair, I would have thought. He suspends the vote for 15 minutes to get copies. Anthony Albanese has called a press conference. The vote is being called off momentarily so we can all cool our heads. We’ve suspended sitting for about 15 minutes to sort it all out. We’re now stuck in the lower house in a very bizarre situation. Labor are saying they do not have copies of the union-busting legislation they are voting on. The government says it brought 60 copies in yesterday. The speaker, Tony Smith, initially demands legislation be brought in. Then there’s confusion because he receives updated advice saying the copies of the legislation were previously in the chamber. Stay tuned. There’s an interesting development in the Senate. Labor has moved (with government support I gather) to establish a new select committee into foreign interference in democracy through social media. Chris and I (and other colleagues at Guardian Australia) have been very attentive to this fake news/misinformation phenomenon having looked deeply into the death tax campaign on Facebook during the May election. Here’s the meat of the motion that’s about to be moved by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister. (1) That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, be established to inquire into and report on the risk posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign interference through social media, with particular reference to: (a) use of social media for purposes that undermine Australia’s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation; (b) responses to mitigate the risk posed to Australia’s democracy and values, including by the Australian Government and social media platforms; (c) international policy responses to cyber-enabled foreign interference and misinformation; (d) the extent of compliance with Australian laws; and (e) any related matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before the second sitting day of May 2022. This inquiry will be one to watch in the new year. Incidentally, Labor has also asked the JSCEM (the joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters) to look at the role of misinformation on the platforms as part of the inquiry it does every election cycle into the conduct of the last federal election. Strange scenes in the lower house. Members are unable to stand to speak, so are signalling they want the call by placing a book or paper on their head. Drama down in the house. The government is returning its union-busting “ensuring integrity” bill, which was defeated on Friday after a shock last-minute switch by One Nation. The bill is currently before the lower house again. But the Coalition is trying to gag debate. It prompts uproar in the chamber. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says the government is attempting to use gag orders that were never intended to limit debate for partisan or party political reasons. It is my view that the government is using this provision to shut down democratic debate in this parliament and it is an abuse of our democratic processes. Tony Burke says the government’s actions are unprecedented. What is happening right now is a change in the role of this house... as to whether it is a parliamentary debating chamber or whether it is only here for the voice of the prime minister and his chosen ministers. Albanese says Labor is being asked to vote on legislation it hasn’t seen. We are being asked now to vote on legislation which I don’t have, there are no copies anywhere. how can we possibly do that. is it within standing orders for us to be voting on legislation, I don’t know what it is. It is appropriate for us to be voting on this without having copies of it? Reports in the Channel Nine newspapers this morning confirmed the government is pressing ahead with plans to privatise Australia’s visa processing services. The shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, was out on the hustings this morning, saying the position leaves 2,000 workers going into Christmas in fear of losing their jobs. This is isn’t good enough we know that this is a terrible idea. We know this because everyone has been saying so. This is an absolutely friendless proposal. Former secretaries of the immigration department have referred to the risks to the integrity of our system, risks also to national security. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned that this could be the new robodebt implemented. And we know what will happen in Australia, because we’ve seen what has happened in the UK with their visa system that has been privatised. We’ve seen massive cuts to services and the creation of a two-tier system, where people who can afford to pay get a fast track system. In Australia we’re not hearing enough about why the government is doing this. The United Firefighters Union was at Parliament House this morning speaking out about the effects of climate change and the extending and intensifying the fire season. From their statement: The United Firefighters Union of Australia passed a unanimous resolution at its national council in Canberra demanding a national approach that would allow firefighting to operate seamlessly across borders, improving the compatibility and capacity of different state and territory services, and boosting the number of professional firefighters. The national council of the UFU passed the resolution calling for an “urgent phase-out of coal, oil, and gas” because they are “driving more dangerous and intense fires”. The UFU national president, Greg McConville, said: Now is absolutely the time to talk about climate change and the ever more intense fires being fought by our members. We are stretched to breaking point. The fire season is longer and more intense than ever. We need to begin work now to boost the nation’s firefighting capacity and make it truly interoperable. Interesting point on the machinery of government changes from Markus Mannheim. Stephen Jones, the shadow assistant treasurer, is on Sky News saying Morrison should accept the New Zealand deal to get children off Manus Island and Nauru. He rejects the government’s insistence that there are no more kids there. Jones urged Morrison to be “pragmatic” and take the NZ deal. The politics of it are toxic and the humanity of it gets left out when the politics gets injected into it. The PM announcing an overhaul of the public service, courtesy of Mike Bowers. The PM’s office has just released a more detailed list of those changes. They will take effect from February. Here’s the full list: The creation of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, which will consolidate the current Department of Education; and the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, which will consolidate: the current Department of Agriculture; and environment functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy. The creation of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, which will consolidate: the current Department of Industry, Innovation and Science; energy functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy; and small business functions from the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, which will consolidate: the current Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development; and the current Department of Communications and the Arts. The Department known as Services Australia (formerly known as the Department of Human Services) will be established as a new Executive Agency, within the Social Services Department. Just to recap on those machinery of government changes: the education and employment departments are being merged the agriculture department is combining with the environment department energy will be merged with the industry, innovation and science department The communications and arts portfolio is being merged with infrastructure and transport department A few interesting tidbits there. Energy is being decoupled from environment. But emissions reduction stays with energy. Just to reiterate, the PM is proposing no costs savings and no job losses, aside from the five departmental secretaries. Morrison is asked whether the government will consider New Zealand’s offer to take refugees from Manus and Nauru. We’ve always been very aware of the New Zealand government’s offer. The government will continue to implement its policies as we’ve set them out. Scott Morrison says he has full confidence in Angus Taylor. What Angus has done in the past six months to get the big stick legislation through, to ensure the dodgy late payment fees that are charged by energy companies, they’re all gone. The policy performance of Angus Taylor is not under question. Morrison says this is not a “savings measure”. So department secretaries and others will undertake the normal things that they do in managing their budgets. This isn’t about any cost saving measures. I expect frankly all departmental secretaries to be maximising efficiencies. Morrison says there will be no change to ministerial portfolios. I’m very pleased, very pleased, with the performance of all my ministers. Morrison announces we’re losing five departmental secretaries as part of the shake-up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking to the media. He’s speaking about changes to the public service. The Australian reported this morning that he was “poised to put an axe through the public service today with plans to dramatically cut the number of government departments with another round of mandarins set for the chopping block”. Morrison announces he will reduce the number of government departments from 18 to 14. He says the APS will need to provide services more “efficiently and effectively”. This sounds very much like a standard machinery of government change. Departments being renamed and subsumed into others. You know, the type we do every few years for some reason. Every time this happens, I can only think of all the corporate merchandise that’s suddenly become redundant due to departmental name changes. I’m weird, I know. But what do they do with it all? So many spare pens. We could use them over here at the Guardian, just FYI, if departments are feeling charitable. So far he’s named changes to the education, agriculture, environment and industry portfolios. We’ll have a full list of changes shortly. Morrison says he wants a public service that “is very much focused on implementation”. They [public servants] should expect from us clear direction, and we should continue to expect from them being able to continue to discharge their duties in the incredibly professional way they do. Mick Keelty, the inspector general of the Murray-Darling basin water resources, spoke to ABC radio a little earlier about just what the government has asked him to do. Keelty was tasked with a review of water sharing arrangement amid damaging protests for the Nationals in Canberra this week. He’s asked precisely what he’s actually going to do: In plain speak, whilst there’s been a lot of attention focussed on the Murray-Darling basin plan, what the federal minister David Littleproud was able to broker this week, and to his great credit ... without jumping to a conclusion is what is happening now is the inquiry will actually properly define what the problem is. Is the problem the Murray-Darling basin plan and the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, or is it something deeper than that? Were the plans [the water sharing agreements] developed at a period of time where the inflows, particularly from the northern basin, were actually happening? And of course for the past two years, they haven’t been happening there’s nothing in the northern basin coming through and feeding into the system. Keelty is asked how the protesters, previously furious at Littleproud and the Nationals, came away feeling comfortable with the result. He said the protesters were not promised any additional water as a result of the review. Nobody has promised more water. There is no more water to give under the current rules. That has been exhaustively examined by both the commonwealth and the individuals involved. But there is water around. The prime minister has just called a press conference for 10.30am. Stick with us. On the Murray Darling, Nationals MP Damian Drum is saying the water-sharing agreements between the states are outdated. He hopes the review by Mick Keelty, the Murray-Darling inspector general, will improve them. These agreements have been in place for over 100 years. But the water regime that now exists ... so much of the water used to be used next to the storage, now the users of the water are 400km away from the storage. Drum was out the front of parliament with Barnaby Joyce a little earlier this week, copping an earful from farmers. He says: The Nationals have got to lead the way because people expect us to fix it. they don’t expect the Liberals to fix it, they don’t expect Labor to fix it, and they know the Greens will only make it worse. Greens senator Nick McKim urges the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to pick up the phone and talk to Jacinda Ardern for the “sake of humanity”. In regard to prime minister Morrison, I think he needs to pick up the phone. Make the arrangement with New Zealand. There is no need for him to wait until the US arrangements have concluded. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I’d urge him to do that for the sake of humanity. Ardern is asked whether New Zealand would consider preventing asylum seekers who go to NZ on resettlement would be prevented from later coming to Australia. She says: If that was a scenario to be created, it would be created by Australia and ultimately it would be in their own domestic policy ... It would be a matter for them. During the interview, Ardern mentions multiple times the deportation of New Zealand citizens from Australia, an issue that has caused much angst across the Tasman. Ardern is asked whether she would want something in return for accepting refugees. She says: That is not how we operate our relationship. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has spoken to Sky News. She said NZ’s offer was still on the table. Yes, that has not changed, but as I say the ball is obviously in Australia’s court. She says Australia has not approached NZ about the deal recently. No discussions at that level and as I say ... as far as I’m concerned we are still in the same status quo. On to other things. Adam Bandt is planning to move to suspend standing orders in the lower house. He wants the house to note that the medevac repeal deal was done in secret. Naomi Wolf is really going after Angus Taylor on this one. I’ll let her tweets do the talking. My colleague Helen Davidson has just filed on further developments in the unlikely stoush between Angus Taylor and the US author Naomi Wolf: Naomi Wolf has reignited her stoush with Australia’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, publishing what she said was a transcript of a phone call with his office. On Thursday morning the US author said she had recorded a call to Taylor’s parliamentary office requesting a “formal correction” to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor “tell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?” Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament in 2013 while recounting an anecdote about “political correctness” and a dispute over a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of “antisemitic dogwhistling”. On Thursday Wolf said Taylor’s staffer had told her that all media who had reported on the story had been given the advice that she was not campaigning against Christmas. “Can I have evidence?” Wolf said. The spokesman responded: “I’m sorry, obviously we can’t prove that has been provided.” The fallout is continuing from the Australian government’s repeal of medevac laws. Australia is now being urged to take New Zealand’s offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus and Nauru a year. We mentioned earlier that there is speculation that Jacqui Lambie was pursuing resettlement when she gave her vote to the government. David Manne, executive director of the Refugee &amp; Immigration Legal Centre, said there was no logic to the government’s refusal to accept the NZ offer. He described suggestions that it would create a “pull” factor for people wanting to come to Australia as “spurious”. “It doesn’t make any rational sense,” he told Sky News. Manne also dismisses the government’s figures showing that most of those who came to Australia through medevac are not in hospital. We’ve reported already that medevac is designed for assessment and healthcare, not just acute hospital care, so it’s not surprising. Manne makes a similar point: When someone is sick, sometimes they’re in hospital, sometimes they’re not. You don’t measure whether someone is in need of healthcare ... by whether they are in hospital. So what exactly are we expecting from today? Well, it’s another day of parliament, so of course we can expect another Angus Taylor controversy. And lo and behold, it’s not yet hit 8.30am, and there’s already something unfolding. Naomi Wolf, the well-known US author, is on the warpath against the minister over his misrepresentation of an alleged encounter they had at Oxford University in their student days. That encounter happened, in Taylor’s telling, at a time when Wolf was on the other side of the ocean. We’ll bring you a bit more about that in a moment. On another Taylor front, there were reports yesterday naming the staffer said to have obtained and distributed the document with dodgy figures about the City of Sydney council’s travel expenditure. Expect more of a pursuit on that from Labor. We’re also anticipating more fallout from the medevac repeal yesterday. The critical question remains: what did Jacqui Lambie secure from the government in exchange for her crucial vote? There’s been some suggestion that she’s won an agreement from the government to pursue the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru. But she’s staying silent on the whole thing, and the government is insisting there is “no secret deal”. The Murray-Darling basin is continuing to cause headaches for the Nationals. The government has announced a review of water sharing in the Murray-Darling. The protesters have left Canberra with a sense of victory. But the question remains: what will the review actually achieve? How will it deliver more water for those without any? Have the Nationals actually resolved the issue? The poor school results out yesterday are still prompting reaction this morning. Tanya Plibersek has been out this morning saying the focus must be on teacher investment, through professional development and mentoring. The government says throwing more money at the problem is not working. There’s another report out this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald about Gladys Liu, reporting that she asked the Liberal party to give her back a donation of at least $100,000. The report claims Liu says the donation she gave was a loan. Happy last sitting day of the year! It’s a momentous occasion. Who knows what else parliament can achieve today? It’s already denied doctor-led medical care to those we’ve condemned to remote islands for daring to seek asylum. Hard to top, even for this bunch, you’d think. But I digress. Alongside the fallout from medevac, there’s plenty of issues on the boil. Angus Taylor. The Murray-Darling basin.The fallout from medevac. Chinese government influence. Stick with us and we’ll get through it all together."
2019-10-27T19:52:50Z,Vietnamese migrants face treacherous journey on the way to UK,"In the Vietnamese community it is known as the “VIP” route – an illegal entry into the UK on a flight using someone else’s passport or a doctored diplomatic one. For the majority who do not have the means of affording it however, the clandestine alternative involves crossing the channel in the back of a lorry and facing the risk the journey could end in a tragedy like the one that unfolded last week. That’s according to a source familiar with the recent case of two Vietnamese teenagers who were taken into the care of social services in the UK after travelling from the other side of the world to work in Britain’s nail bar industry. “One of the girls said she went from Vietnam to China and worked there for about a year and a half,” said one member of the community who was familiar with their cases and who added that they were unaware of last week’s tragedy, when 39 bodies were found in a back of a lorry in Grays, Essex. “Then she went from China to Russia, where there was a holding place for people waiting to go further. From the holding place a new journey would start about once a month. Her journey was divided into very different stages, and in every stage she stayed with Vietnamese people.” In most cases, the source added, those who make the trip in a lorry were dropped off not too far from the port of entry, before being left to make their way onwards and into the community in Britain. “We were told by one of the girls that they were dropped off and left on their own and then found their way into a town centre. In most big centres in the UK you’ll have nail shops, usually run by Vietnamese people. They said that they found a shop and went in. “Conditions in the nail bar were very bad, obviously, but it is relative. What is bad here might be very good by Vietnamese standards, and especially if they come from a rural area.” Apparently at least one of the girls wanted to stay in the UK. “She also came from the same province as the people who died in the lorry. The economic situation in that province is very bad.” It’s not clear how the teenagers got on the radar of the police or the social services, who are now caring for them, but it’s clear they are not the only ones. Figures released by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act disclose the cases of 121 Vietnamese nationals who were identified as possible victims of human trafficking last year. Adults receive 14 days of what the Home Office calls “move-on” support including accommodation and subsistence, specialist assistance including counselling and access to physical and mental health care. The numbers, released in February this year, are from a live database which is subject to change. Accurate statistics about the real numbers of trafficked Vietnamese people remain elusive, largely because most are hidden and undocumented. According to the Salvation Army, which works with victims of trafficking, more Vietnamese men were referred to the charity between July 2018 and July 2019 than any other nationality. The charity worked with 209 people from Vietnam over that period, a 248% increase on the number referred five years earlier."
2019-12-20T09:30:13Z,Trump's 'shameful' migrant stance condemns thousands to violent limbo in Mexico,"Alex Guevara weeps as he describes the five-month odyssey that brought his family from Venezuela to a diner just metres from the United States border – and the uncertainty and danger that lie ahead. It was June when Guevara and his family fled on foot into Colombia, carrying nothing but a Bible and a worthless Venezuelan coin to remind them of their homeland. “It was life or death – either we left or we left,” Guevara’s wife, Andrea, said of the persecution they had suffered because of ties to the opposition movement trying to force Nicolás Maduro from power. From Medellín, the couple flew to Cancún with their two young children before traveling overland to one of the most dangerous stretches of the US-Mexico border and crossing the Rio Grande in a rubber dinghy. When border guards detained them on US soil, the Guevaras thought their ordeal was nearly over. But, rather than being allowed to stay in the US while they sought asylum, they were separated and spent a fortnight in detention before being released into one of Mexico’s most notorious border towns in the dead of night. “Wow, that was a low blow,” said Andrea. “After all the trauma and everything we had been through in our country … we found ourselves in the mouth of another wolf.” The Guevaras – who asked for their real names not to be used – are among more than 57,000 people who have been forced back into Mexico this year by an innocuously named immigration policy that activists consider one of the cruellest and most ruthlessly efficient strands of Donald Trump’s anti-migration crusade. Unveiled in January, the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) project, or Remain in Mexico as it is better known, stipulates that asylum seekers must wait for their court hearings in Mexican border towns – several of which count among the most violent places on Earth. Even when they do reach court after months of waiting, only a tiny proportion of applicants succeed. Research by academics at Syracuse University found that only 11 out of nearly 10,000 asylum requests were granted in the first nine months of this year. “It’s just a chicken-shit administrative way of not letting people legally seek asylum,” said Kelly Overton, whose NGO, Border Kindness, helps the policy’s victims in Mexicali, one of six border cities involved in the scheme alongside Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros. “The majority of people are fleeing something – whether that’s an immediate threat of violence, [or] a guaranteed life of poverty and despair for their children. They are doing this for a reason,” Overton said. “And it is shameful how the United States is responding. It is devastating.” Overton, whose group buses asylum seekers to hearings in the US, said the human consequences of the policy were twofold. Many of those sent back, convinced they stood no chance of being legally admitted to the US, were risking their lives by returning to Central American countries suffering some of the world’s highest murder rates. “Some of the people we have helped this year that have gone back will be dead by next year,” Overton said. Those who chose to wait it out, meanwhile, were exposed to con artists and kidnappers who preyed on those whose accents or clothes marked them out as outsiders. Earlier this month the advocacy group Human Rights First accused the Trump administration of exposing asylum seekers to “life-threatening dangers” after documenting 636 cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault and other violent attacks against those returned to Mexico. Victims included a nine-year-old disabled girl and her mother who were kidnapped and raped after being sent back to Tijuana. In Nuevo Laredo, which is located in a Mexican state the US considers as dangerous as Iraq and Syria, 197 kidnappings have already been recorded, including of a seven-year-old Honduran girl. Human Rights First researcher Kennji Kizuka said he suspected such perils were actually part of Trump’s plan. Exposure to hostile environments was designed to “scare people out of remaining and waiting for their immigration proceedings” and thus reduce migration. Terrifying stories of violence and exploitation are easy to encounter in towns such as Mexicali. A Cuban woman told of how armed men had forced her into a car in broad daylight at the start of a terrifying four-day abduction during which she was deprived of food and water. “They took everything – our money, our clothes, everything,” said the woman, who had also fled her country for political reasons. “Thank God we managed to escape and we’re alive to tell the story – not everyone is so lucky.” A Honduran woman, who also asked not to be named, said she had not left the shelter where she was living since being approached by a gang of pornographers offering her $50 to pose for naked photographs. “I’m scared – really, really scared,” she said. The Guevaras, whose home is now a cramped flat on Mexicali’s outskirts, said they also lived in constant fear, speaking quietly in public to hide their distinctive Venezuelan accents and hardly venturing outside. “People say to us: ‘Be careful. Don’t go out on the streets. Don’t leave the kids on their own,’” Andrea said. “You never know who you are dealing with here.” Her husband insisted they could not return to Venezuela. “But Mexico is almost as dangerous.” Remain in Mexico is part of a wider set of anti-immigration initiatives created since Trump took office in 2017, including an asylum ban targeting Central American migrants, a dramatic reduction of refugee resettlements and a highly controversial family separation policy scrapped after a global outcry. Margaret Cargioli, a San Diego-based immigration lawyer, called the policy part of “an astonishing anti-migrant machine” designed to repel outsiders. “All of the measures, fundamentally, are racist and xenophobic policies,” Cargioli said. “It’s very planned out, it’s very deliberate.” Trump defends the moves as intended to protect the US from “bad hombres”, “thugs” and “animals”. But in Mexicali the Guardian found mostly desperate young families forced from their homes by situations far beyond their control. In a dingy abandoned cinema converted into a migrant flophouse, Norma Quevedo said crime and deprivation had compelled her to flee Guatemala City with her five-year-old son, Antonio. “The truth is we want a better future for our children … so we decided to risk it all,” said the 30-year-old single mother. In another shelter Leonela Cabrera Martínez, a Honduran mother-of-three, said she was trying to outrun gangsters who targeted her family for failing to pay “rent”. “They killed one of my brothers. That’s why we came,” said Cabrera, who was with three daughters aged 10, six and three. “I can’t go back,” Cabrera insisted. “If I could go back, I would. But I can’t.” On a recent afternoon the shelter welcomed its latest guests: a 42-year-old asylum seeker called Santo Catalino López Velásquez who had been returned from the US just hours earlier after a 36-hour stint in the freezing hielera (icebox) detention centre with his wife, Fidelia Jaqueline García Álvarez, and their baby daughter and toddler son. Like nearly every other migrant interviewed for this story López shed tears that spoke of overwhelming emotional exhaustion as he told his story. In March, land-grabbers in southern Honduras had threatened to kill him if he failed to surrender his small farm. In April they torched his home. Days later López fled, stowing away inside lorries all the way to the US border with his wife and children. Penniless and still dazed from the ordeal, López said he had no idea how he would support his family as he remained in Mexico – let alone attend their court hearing 130 miles away in San Diego. “We haven’t got a single peso,” he admitted. “Nada.” But like many of those now stuck in border limbo, López was sure of one thing. “There’s no way we can go back – we’ll be killed,” he said, breaking down as he spoke. “I cannot go back.” Additional reporting by Jordi Lebrija"
2019-11-20T14:05:50Z,"Migrants detained in Libya for profit, leaked EU report reveals","The EU has admitted in a leaked report that it cannot monitor the Libyan coastguard and that the detention of migrants is a “profitable business model” for Libya’s government, with whom it has recently renewed a controversial deal to stem migration to Europe. The report details the fate of refugees fleeing for Europe who have been picked up by the Brussels-backed coastguard and put in official and unofficial detention camps in dire and dangerous conditions. Widespread human rights violations, deaths, unexplained disappearances, bribery and corruption are cited in the 13-page paper, which still praises the “progress achieved” in reducing the numbers leaving the Libyan coast for Europe. Under a recently renewed multimillion-euro deal, the EU and Italy provide the Libyan coastguard with cash, training and boats to intercept migrants in the Mediterranean, as part of an attempt to block people from European shores. The decision was made last month to continue with the deal, and provide an extra €5m in funding, despite an admission in the EU paper that “conditions for migrants in Libya have deteriorated severely recently due to security concerns related to the conflict and developments in the smuggling and trafficking dynamics and economy, in addition to the worsening situation in the overcrowded detention facilities”. The leaked EU document, marked Limite (restricted), of which only an almost entirely redacted version has been published, lays out the “severe” consequences in an internal call for “immediate action” to save the lives of those caught up in the system. The document, written by the presidency of the EU council for a “high-level working group on asylum and migration”, reports: There is no record of the numbers of detention camps but estimates of the number of official and unofficial facilities range from 17 to 35, some of which are said to be run by militia. More than 5,000 people are being held and about 3,700 of those are located in “conflict areas”. A number of the detention centres “are alleged of having links to human trafficking” and “there is no proper registration system for migrants”. “Serious cases of corruption and bribery in the centres have been detected,” the EU paper says. EU officials are not allowed onshore to monitor the makeup or activities of the Libyan coastguard to the “security challenges”. The government in Libya has failed to improve the situation in the camps or deal with the regular reports of “disappearances” of people picked up by the Libyan coastguard. “The government’s reluctance to address the problems raises the question of its own involvement”, the paper says. The “reluctance of officials to cooperate is closely linked to the widely reported human rights violations that take place in the detention centres and to the fact that the facilities form a profitable business model for the current Libyan government”. According to humanitarian organisations, detainees are coerced by camp officials into asking relatives to pay for their release. At least 53 men, women and children were killed and 130 injured in July when a detention facility near Tripoli, in which 644 migrants and refugees had been detained, was bombed. The bombed-out centre was then swiftly refilled with people provided by the Libyan coastguard. The detention camps “suffer from overcrowding and the conditions are poor. In particular, there are difficulties in relation to sanitary facilities and food and water supply. Severe human rights violations have been widely reported”. The EU has been pressing the Libyan government to stop the arbitrary detention of migrants. The leaked paper, distributed to key officials in September, notes that the Libyan authorities had agreed to close three detention centres near Tripoli but “so far, any concrete panning has not followed this promise”. The reduction in migration has instead been celebrated in Brussels, with the number of people arriving in Italy from Libya dropping from more than 107,000 in 2017 to about 13,000 in 2018, and to just 1,100 by August this year. The Libyan coastguard is said to have intercepted 5,280 people as of August 2019. The European parliament’s civil liberties committee is due to interrogate EU officials on Thursday, with the Labour MEP Claude Moraes seeking full disclosure of the human cost. Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch MEP on the committee, said: “Over the years, billions of euros have flown into Libya with the sole purpose of keeping migrants away from Europe. It is basically part of Fortress Europe, the European equivalent of Trump’s wall. Just a lot more lethal than the wall. “So maybe fewer people have drowned, fewer have reached the shores of Europe. But instead countless people died in the desert, were sold on slave markets, were tortured, raped and starved in Libyan detention camps, or were caught amidst violent conflict. “Meanwhile, people smugglers are thriving. No one in their right mind can call this a success. This policy is morally and financially bankrupt.”"
2019-09-17T17:33:12Z,Phillip Lee and HIV tests for migrants | Letter,"Dr Phillip Lee MP claims that he has been misrepresented on his 2014 amendment to the immigration bill, saying that he wanted migrants screened for HIV “so that they could be treated”, rather than so they could be kept out (Report, 17 September). The text of his 2014 amendment reads: “(1) The Secretary of State may by order provide that persons who apply for immigration permission must demonstrate that they are not carriers of any of the prescribed pathogens listed in subsection (2). “(2) The prescribed pathogens are— (a) Hepatitis B; (b) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus); (c) such other pathogens as the Secretary of State may prescribe by order under this section.” It does not mention anything about treatment. It seems that if anyone has misrepresented Dr Lee’s views, he himself has, either in 2019 or in the text of his 2014 amendment.

2019-12-29T07:04:31Z,Foster agencies add pressure on UK to take child refugees,"Pressure is building on the Home Office to fulfil its promise to give sanctuary to child refugees as it emerged that foster agencies across the UK have offered dozens of places that remain unused. Estimates suggest there are hundreds of places available for vulnerable unaccompanied minors in addition to the 1,400 offers from local councils that the Home Office is accused of ignoring. Britain’s largest fostering and adoption charity, Tact Care, said that fostering agencies had told the Home Office they had significant capacity to house child refugees. Tact Care alone had 25 spaces that could be used immediately. Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact Care, said: “The Home Office could easily accommodate its obligations to offer sanctuary to vulnerable minors. Its response has nothing to do with capacity, it’s essentially an ideological decision they are making. It’s not one based on child welfare or our ability to do it as a country, it’s that they don’t want to do it. We’ve told the Home Office but they are not interested.” Pressure is also mounting on cabinet ministers who backed a scheme to welcome unaccompanied minors to take a “moral stance” after some protections for children were dropped from the Brexit bill. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, was one of the Tories to rebel in support of a plan drawn up by the Labour peer Lord Dubs in 2016, which committed the UK to accept almost 500 unaccompanied child refugees. Lord Dubs was one of 10,000 children rescued from the Nazis by the Kindertransport in 1939. A separate commitment to allow child refugees stranded in Europe to reunite with families in Britain after Brexit was dropped by Boris Johnson. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called on ministers and Tory MPs to reverse the “moral disgrace” of removing the protection for children. “At the election, Johnson promised to maintain the UK’s reputation as a ‘beacon of freedom and human rights’.” he said. “However, at the first hurdle, he showed his true colours: tearing up protection for some of the world’s most vulnerable people.” Charities are stepping in after growing frustrated with the Home Office’s slowness in transferring child refugees to the UK. The Dubs amendment of May 2016 followed a public outcry about the plight of children stranded in Europe. Campaigners had hoped that as many as 3,000 children would benefit, but ministers set a limit of 480. The Home Office refuses to specify how many of these children have since been transferred to Britain. Now a project, funded by a Jewish philanthropist, will find family-based placements for children who arrive under the Dubs scheme and ensure that councils have money upfront to provide a home. The project, launched in Bristol, Wiltshire and the London borough of Lewisham, and run by a Christian charity called Home for Good, is seeking an initial 20 homes. The charity said the situation was so poor that it had identified children processed by the UN refugee agency in European camps who were still waiting for places to become available. Emily Christou, head of advocacy at Home for Good, said: “We heard that the 480 still seems to be way off. We knew there was public goodwill out there and we knew that local authorities are saying they’ll take more.” The scheme’s first meeting between a family and a social worker took place last week. The next step will be winning approval from a local authority panel and receiving an allowance to cover the costs of opening their home. Jennifer Nadel, co-director of the campaign group Compassion in Politics, said: “It is scandalous and heartbreaking that the UK isn’t honouring its moral and legal obligation to these refugee children. We are the fifth largest economy in the world; we have families and local authorities willing to welcome these children with open arms. The problem is the lack of political will.” The Home Office says it is committed to the Dubs scheme and that safeguarding vulnerable children will remain a priority after Brexit."
2019-12-21T21:00:56Z,Home Office ‘ignoring offers to give homes to child refugees’,"The Home Office has been accused of ignoring more than 1,400 offers from local councils to house child refugees, prompting criticism that Boris Johnson’s government is defying its obligations to offer sanctuary to vulnerable minors. Councils across the UK have volunteered to take hundreds of unaccompanied children from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, numbers of arrivals are said to be “pitifully low to nonexistent”. Wiltshire, Leicestershire, Brighton and Hove, along with the London boroughs of Islington, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Lewisham have each pledged to take at least 100 children, according to charity Safe Passage. Birmingham has offered to support 80 more minors, Bristol 60 and Leicester 50. More than 400 of the offers come from Conservative-run local authorities, 950 from Labour councils and the remainder from SNP and independents. It is estimated that about 200 child refugees are living in terrible conditions in northern France, with thousands more trapped in Italy and Greece, where camps are vastly overcrowded and conditions are described as dire. Many are eligible for transfer to the UK. The claims of Home Office resistance to the councils’ offers comes after Johnson told parliament on Thursday he was reducing legal protections for refugee children in his new Brexit bill. The legislation, passed last week with a majority of 124, jettisons a commitment in EU regulations that secures safeguards for asylum-seeking minors in Europe who want to reunite with family in the UK. The commitment was in the original withdrawal agreement bill after a campaign led by Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis via Kindertransport when he was six. Last night Dubs said: “It’s miserable. Safe Passage have found quite a few local authorities that are willing to take children. We’re talking about a basic principle here. It’s extremely mean and lacking in humanitarian instincts for the government to keep pulling back on this.” The Home Office on Saturday night disputed the figure of 1,400 council placements waiting to be filled. Hours earlier, charities in northern France said they had found a 15-year-old Afghan boy called Mustapha who is sleeping rough near Calais and trying to reach England to be reunited with his brother. Campaigners said the prime minister’s bill threatened the teenager’s hopes of reaching the UK via a safe legal route. “These kids are in a desperate situation and they’ve got no way out,” said Dubs. Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy said Johnson’s Brexit bill was a taste of things to come. “This is a very clear signal of what sort of government Boris Johnson intends to run. It’s a direct attack on some of the most vulnerable children in the world and it shows that any hint of compassionate conservatism will play no part in his premiership. This approach will extend to welfare, disability and we’ll see the most rightwing government in my lifetime.” Beth Gardiner-Smith, chief executive of Safe Passage, said the Brexit bill “placed vulnerable child refugees on the negotiating table” and meant more lone children would be forced to take huge risks trying to get into the UK. “This action is all the more inexplicable because we know there is broad public support for helping child refugees,” she said. Gardiner-Smith added: “Instead of scrapping what few protections there are in place, the government should be focusing its energies on working with councils to ensure there is adequate funding to fill those 1,400 places and offer hope to hundreds of children stranded across Europe.” The pledges have been made by councils under the Home Office’s Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme (VCRS) on the proviso that full funding is in place, with a common complaint being that the central government money available is insufficient. The only available data indicates that just 20 unaccompanied minors have been allowed into the UK under a scheme begun more than three years ago to resettle 3,000 vulnerable refugee children from conflict zones in the Middle East and north Africa. Separate figures also reveal a sluggish take-up under the Dubs amendment, launched in April 2016 and geared to allowing unaccompanied child refugees from Europe into the UK. MPs and campaigners hoped the Dubs scheme would resettle around 3,000 children but ministers controversially set a limit of 480 with the Home Office yesterday not specifying how many have since been transferred. “It was limited because they said councils hadn’t find more places but since then Safe Passage has discovered there are quite a few local authorities who’ve come up with more places. The government is trying to shut down the scheme on spurious grounds,” said Dubs. Charities said they had detected a hardening of the Home Office approach to child refugees even before the bill was unveiled. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: “It’s become absolutely horrible, I do not understand how it can be this hostile, how our country can behave like this, how they keep saying no to this.” Campaigners say the issue partly explains why the numbers of vulnerable minors brought to the UK are so low despite so many council places being available. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have a proud record of helping vulnerable children, granting protection to 41,000 since 2010 and doing more than the vast majority of EU countries to help unaccompanied minors. “Protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit and this new clause reaffirms our commitment while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations.”"
2019-10-02T16:38:58Z,Action needed on refugee children in Greece | Letter,"As a charity supporting unaccompanied refugee children on the Greek islands, we are devastated by reports of death and injury in a fire at Moria camp on Lesbos and echo calls from Médecins Sans Frontières that children must be urgently evacuated from the islands (Report, 1 October). The children we support have family in the UK and the right to family reunion under EU law. They should be safe with their loved ones, not stuck in overcrowded camps in intolerable conditions, waiting for months, even years, to be transferred to safety. But at a time when safe, legal routes are needed more than ever, a no-deal Brexit could block the route to family reunion for these children. The UK must not abandon unaccompanied children in Europe. We urge the government to commit that, no matter the outcome of Brexit, children will be urgently evacuated from these camps and safely reunited with their families.

2019-11-22T11:30:38Z,'This is meant to be a caring country?': refugees battle the cold in Madrid,"On Monday night, a group of newcomers to Madrid put their children to bed. In the absence of a roof, walls or mattresses, they wrapped them in blankets and tucked them into open suitcases to guard against the cold of the streets. Had it not been for the intervention of a neighbourhood volunteer network who paid for a hostel, the two families who had fled violence in their home country of El Salvador would have spent the whole night outside the city’s overwhelmed emergency shelter coordination centre. As temperatures in the Spanish capital plummet, rain falls and the city prepares to host next month’s UN climate summit, authorities are unable to provide basic shelter and protection to dozens of migrants and asylum seekers, including children. The number of people arriving in the Madrid region to seek asylum has almost doubled over the past year, rising from 20,700 to 41,000. The Salvadoran families ended up sleeping on the floor of a church in the south of the city where volunteers have spent the last 25 years working with immigrants, refugees, young people and people with drug problems. On Wednesday night alone, the centre fed and sheltered two dozen men, women and children from Venezuela, El Salvador, Colombia and Yemen. “We know that this isn’t our country and we can’t expect anything but I just felt sad when we ended up on the street,” said one Salvadoran woman, who would not give her name for fear of reprisals from the criminal gangs that drove her family overseas. Another Salvadoran woman had brought her two children to Spain after the gang demanding money from the family gave them an ultimatum: “The money you don’t pay us is the money you use to bury your children.” She said they had spent much of the money they had on searching for accommodation as far away as Ávila, a 90-minute bus ride from Madrid. “We’ve found some wonderful people here, who’ve been so helpful, but I just don’t understand how this is meant to be a caring country, judging by all this,” she said. They are among the luckier ones. A small camp has sprung up outside the Samur emergency shelter headquarters, where, cocooned in anoraks and sleeping bags, a handful of young Venezuelans were waiting for somewhere warm and dry to sleep. “Come into the living room,” said one, pointing to the pile of cardboard and blankets that covered the pavement. Daniel Pérez, 29, who used to earn his living repairing medical equipment in a town close to the border with Colombia, said he was applying for asylum despite the improvised accommodation. “We were in the Red Cross shelter for a few days but we’ve been camping here for three days,” he said. “The first night was really difficult because we had nothing and it was -1C – we’re not used to such cold.” Like all the migrants and refugees the Guardian spoke to, Pérez and his friends had been overwhelmed by the kindness of local people, who had been handing out blankets, buying them food and making them soup. And no matter how cold it got, said Pérez, he would rather be on the streets of Madrid than back in his troubled country. “This generation of Venezuelans just can bear it any longer,” he said. “We realised that we’re not trees, rooted to the spot, and that we can move away. We’ll get through this because it’s still better to be here than in Venezuela. All this is just temporary.” Javier Baeza, the priest who runs the San Carlos Borromeo parish centre that took in the Salvadorans, teases and jokes with his guests. But he is deeply angry over the lack of care and has reported the protection failure to the public ombudsman. “People come here and they’re disappointed because they think the image of a country with basic human rights is real and they’re profoundly mistreated,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a capacity problem – the problem is the lack of political will at every level. There’s no political will from the government for immigrants to be looked after properly, the Madrid regional government isn’t doing anything at all, and Madrid city council doesn’t have the will to help 100 people in one of the world’s greatest capitals.” On Thursday, the conservative mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, wrote to Spain’s acting prime minister – the Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez – claiming that central government’s inaction had triggered the collapse of an already overstretched system. The mayor also asked Sánchez to find 1,300 emergency places to help guarantee refugees were treated with dignity and respect. The government, however, insists the council needs to do more to deal with the emergency. Consuelo Rumí, Spain’s secretary of state for migration, said other major Spanish cities such as Barcelona managed to allocate sufficient resources to vulnerable arrivals, adding that it was Madrid city council’s responsibility to help those currently on the streets. “Madrid city council, which serves a population of 4 million people, just can’t have so few resources on the street,” she said. “Until someone has actually formalised their asylum application, they’re someone who’s on the street and who needs to be looked after by the city council. They just can’t have such scant resources on the street, especially at this time of year.” A spokeswoman for the regional government said it was a matter for the central government and the city council. Ana Zamora, a volunteer with the Red Solidaria de Acogida (Solidarity Welcome Network), which has been working to help people find shelter, said “totally ineffective management” meant the relevant authorities were failing in their basic duty of care. “The people sleeping rough are all seeking international protection and none of them is getting the help to which, in theory, they’re entitled,” she said. “These people have no other option – they’ve spent all their money on getting here and they have no more.” While the political squabbles continued, one of the Salvadoran mothers sat crying in a parish 5,000 miles (8,000km) from home, thinking about the church where her family used to worship, where they would donate food and toys to the poor. “My daughter is confused by all this and she asked if we were poor now,” she said. “We’re not asking for luxury, we’re not even asking for comfort. We came to Spain because we’d been told we would be protected here.” Migration in Spain Sánchez won huge plaudits in June last year after one of his first acts in office was to announce that the country would take in the 630 migrants and refugees stranded onboard the rescue ship Aquarius. Sánchez said Spain had a duty to help avert a humanitarian catastrophe while his foreign minister, Josep Borrell, called for an end to “ostrich politics” when it came to the issue of migration. In 2018, 56,480 migrants and refugees reached Spain by sea, with 769 people dying in the attempt. The record number of arrivals to Spain, partly driven by the closure of other European routes, placed huge strain on the country’s reception infrastructure. It was also seized on by conservative and far-right parties who sought to make it a political issue. The far-right, anti-immigration Vox party, which won 52 seats in this month’s general election, has accused unaccompanied foreign children of being “a serious problem in our neighbourhoods”. Its messages are a far cry from those of the former Madrid mayor Manuela Carmena, whose administration famously hung a banner on city hall reading: “Refugees welcome.” Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, said this week the party was looking into the possibility of abandoning the landmark UN convention on the rights of the child so that Spain would be able to deport all irregular immigrants regardless of their age."
2019-10-25T20:13:54Z,Amnesty leaders condemn US's Remain in Mexico policy as 'disgrace',"Amnesty International leaders from around the world on Friday decried the US policy of sending asylum-seekers back to dangerous Mexican border towns to wait for their immigration cases as an “international disgrace” that must be ended. During a visit to the US-Mexico border this week, Amnesty International leaders from the US, UK, Kenya, Mexico, Greece and Canada said the Remain in Mexico, or Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), program had manufactured a crisis at the border by sending more than 50,000 people to Mexico. The asylum seekers, mostly families from Central America, are waiting in some of the most dangerous cities in the world, where they must fend for themselves without healthcare, work opportunities or school for their children. “The Remain in Mexico policy is nothing short of an international disgrace, rather than calling it a migration protection policy this is really a migrant rejection policy,” said Irungu Houghton, the executive director of Amnesty International Kenya. “It is incompetent, it is inhumane, and it is a cruel way of dealing with people who are fleeing for their lives. “Rather than funding programs that deal with the reasons why people are coming into the United States of America or even dealing with the consequences of dealing with these large numbers of people, precious resources are being spent militarizing borders and building walls,” he added. Houghton noted that Kenya is currently hosting 468,000 refugees, while the US, a much bigger country, has drastically shrunk its refugee and asylum programs. Gabriel Sakellaridis, executive director of Amnesty International Greece, said he was shocked by the scenes at the border and the US had engineered a situation similar to Europe, which has been pushing asylum and refugee processing outside its borders. “In both of these ways, we see the United States and Europe, who are two of the wealthiest and most prosperous areas in the world, trying to create a front yard in either Mexico, or in Turkey or in Libya, in order to avoid their obligations to international refugee law and human rights,” Sakellaridis said. The Remain in Mexico policy started in Tijuana in January before being rolled out at other border cities. Trump administration officials have said it is effective at keeping people out of the US and is improving due process – the opposite of what advocates on the border have reported. This month, Human Rights First revealed at least 340 reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacks against people returned to Mexico while they wait for their case to be heard in US immigration court Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said people they visited in camps in Matamoros, where more than 2,000 people are staying in squalid conditions, expect to be kidnapped and many had been kidnapped more than once. “This expectation is part of the daily life waiting for their asylum cases to be considered,” Huang said. “It’s something that they all know will happen and it adds incredible stress to the already existing trauma these people have experienced.” Kate Allen, executive director of Amnesty International UK, said “people’s lives are absolutely being ruined” by the Remain in Mexico policy. “This chaos of 50,000 people is completely self-inflected and unnecessary,” Allen said. Like the other leaders, she commended the work of shelter operators in Mexico, legal aid providers, teachers and other volunteers trying to help refugees at the border. Allen said: “In all this what is quite wonderful is to see the way that civil society on both sides of the border is doing absolutely everything it can do, so ordinary people, who are taking action.”"
2019-11-08T17:35:48Z,The Essex lorry deaths are not just ‘tragic’. They’re political | Imogen Dobie,"The 39 Vietnamese nationals whose bodies were discovered in a lorry trailer in Essex last month had pinned their hopes for their futures on their journey to the UK. Images taken of the lorry show stickers on its windscreen displaying the words The Ultimate Dream – a deeply ironic reflection on the reality for so many migrants. Newspapers and articles covering the subsequent investigation have adopted the language of tragedy, horror and shock – the Independent referred to the “tragic deaths”, a Global Times editorial talked of a “serious humanitarian disaster” that occurred “under the eyes of” the British, and the BBC has repeatedly used the word “tragedy” in its reports. Meanwhile, the police force has used similar language in its statements. The deputy chief constable of Essex police, Pippa Mills, told reporters in Grays that these lorry deaths were “an absolute tragedy” and a “tragic discovery” to have made. And the prime minister, Boris Johnson, signed a book of condolence to the victims, writing that “the whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country”. Throughout the year, journalists, politicians and investigators have described similar incidents by appealing to emotions in a manner that presents migrant deaths as something apolitical. After the discovery of the bodies of 58 Chinese people in a container in Dover in 2000, Gwyn Prosser, the then Labour MP for Dover and Deal, said he was stunned by the event, which emphasised “the awful desperation some people must be experiencing to take the chances they take to cross the channel on the backs of lorries”. The invocation of a humanitarian – rather than a political – shock and grief is prominent in reports about people who die attempting to cross the border between the US and Mexico, as well as in reports of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea. When more than 100 migrants perished off Lampedusa in 2013, Jean-Claude Mignon, the then president of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly, claimed that “a terrible human tragedy is taking place at the gates of Europe”. For many, these words of grief seem most fitting for the description of such incidents. They allow us to express the emotions we feel as witnesses to unnecessary deaths, and they point to the suffering that people endure in their attempts to secure better lives. Such appeals to emotion, however, carry out other work behind the scenes – work that does not always have migrants’ best interests at heart. While emotive language is understandable, we need to combine this with critical commentary and political analysis. Simply labelling events as “tragedies”, without any analysis of the conditions that created them, frames avoidable deaths as exceptional, isolated, symbolic incidents. We are encouraged to pause, to weep and to regret. We are not, however, encouraged to investigate, criticise or protest. In these moments of mourning, we lose sight of politics and the question of culpability. Migrant deaths can be presented as accidents rather than the logical outcome of border policies that deliberately reduce legal pathways of migration. Framing such events in mainly emotional terms can hide people’s histories. In learning of the fate of the 39 Essex migrants, we focus on the moment of death, somewhere en route from Belgium, rather than on the more complex individual stories. Likewise, we think of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean or in Mexico in isolation from the lives that came before. The last page of a person’s story becomes the only page we are asked to read. What has happened to the longer stories of why these individuals travelled to Europe or America? What factors made them feel that they had no choice but to attempt dangerous, and often illegal, journeys? It is here, in the narratives of violence, conflict, oppression and discrimination, that we can find the true “tragedies”. But since these tragedies are deeply political, and deeply connected to big issues such as labour exploitation, people-smuggling and the lack of legal migration routes for those seeking international protection, we are not encouraged to consider them. If we do not look into the deep-rooted dynamics of migration and its connection to suffering, then we will never truly be able to prevent incidents like this from happening again. Here we are, 19 years on from the Dover lorry deaths, six years on from the Lampedusa disaster, discussing the same issues in the same language. Meanwhile, nothing fundamental has changed in terms of the driving forces which propel people away from the places that they used to call home. What remains outside the order of emotive language is the figure of a migrant with a history and a voice, who we can stand with in the struggle for rights. Migrants should not become silent victims who we cry for – they need to be talked about as subjects seeking political rights and protection. They need politics, not pity. • Imogen Dobie is a PhD student focusing on issues of migration and asylum"
2019-10-07T11:46:39Z,Sudden deaths of hundreds of migrant workers in Qatar not investigated,"Qatar is failing to investigate the sudden deaths of hundreds of migrant works, the Guardian can reveal. Hundreds of labourers in the World Cup host nation die each year, with the majority of the fatalities attributed to heart attacks or “natural causes” by the Qatari authorities. Many are young men who die in their sleep – a phenomenon locally dubbed “sudden death syndrome”. Last week the Guardian reported that hundreds of thousands of workers were being exposed to potentially fatal levels of heat stress, toiling in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day. High temperatures put a huge strain on the cardiovascular system and cardiologists say there is a direct link between heat stress and the high numbers of young workers dying in the summer months. In most cases no autopsies are performed on the bodies of migrant workers, whose deaths have been attributed to cardiovascular or “natural” causes. In 2014, a report from the Qatari regime’s own lawyers, international law firm DLA Piper, “strongly” recommended that it commissioned research into the deaths of migrant workers from cardiac arrest. Yet so far it has failed to take action. At least 1,025 Nepalis died in Qatar between 2012 and 2017, 676 of them from causes deemed to be natural. The causes included cardiac arrest, heart attack, respiratory failure and “sickness”, according to a number of official sources, including the Foreign Employment Board, a government agency in Nepal responsible for the welfare of migrant workers. The FEB’s data is largely derived from death certificates issued in Qatar. Data from the Indian government reveals that 1,678 Indians died in Qatar between 2012 and August 2018. Of these deaths, 1,345 were classified as “natural” – a rate of four each week. Qatari law prohibits postmortem examinations except in cases where a crime may have been committed or the deceased may have suffered from an illness prior to death. However, the 2014 DLA Piper report recommended that the law “be extended to allow for autopsies or postmortem examinations in all cases of unexpected or sudden deaths”. A forensic expert in Qatar told the Guardian that in the majority of these cases, only an external examination is performed to determine the cause of death. Qatar’s reluctance to perform autopsies has left families across south Asia confused and suspicious about how their loved ones died. Rupchandra Rumba was working as a scaffolder at the Education City World Cup stadium when he died in his labour camp in June this year. He was 24. Rumba’s death certificate identified the cause of death as “acute cardio respiratory failure due to natural cause”. Shortly after his death, Rumba’s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, received a call from his boss. “He said: ‘We tried our best to treat him but he didn’t survive. We took him to the hospital for autopsy.’” But no autopsy was carried out, said Pakrin. “There were some blood stains around his mouth and nose, but the rest of his body was untouched.” A Qatar government official said that according to the law, families of the deceased must approve an autopsy before it is carried out. “In most cases related to guest workers, families refuse an autopsy due to a desire to have the body returned as quickly as possible for the completion of religious burial or cremation rites. This creates a difficulty in respect of investigating the cause of death in some cases,” the official said. However, the Guardian spoke to the families of three Nepali workers who died in Qatar in the past 18 months, including Pakrin. None had been asked whether they wanted an autopsy. Kausik Ray, a professor of public health at Imperial College London, said: “People aged 20 to 50 in general don’t die in their sleep suddenly … You could not say they died from heart failure or respiratory failure without a postmortem, unless you had information about their prior [medical] history.” Ganesh Gurung, a member of the Policy Research Academy, a government thinktank in Nepal, said death certificates are largely a formality, issued to satisfy the requirements of the airlines that transport the bodies home. “Because it’s just a formality, the doctors tend to issue certificates based on hearsay. In most cases, they do not even bother to examine the dead bodies, let alone conduct a postmortem. Postmortems are extremely rare, because they require time and money. Why would they bother to spend time and money on the dead?” Gurung said mandatory postmortems should be incorporated into all bilateral labour agreements between Nepal and the countries where its migrant labourers work. Nick McGeehan, a director of Fair/Square Projects, an organisation that conducts research on Gulf migrant workers, said the findings expose a lack of concern for workers’ welfare. “The law on autopsies is further evidence of the different value that’s attached to the lives of low-paid migrant workers. If hundreds of Gulf nationals or westerners were dying every year in unexplained circumstances, there would be uproar and money would be thrown at this issue.”"
2019-11-07T19:32:23Z,Indigenous Mexicans tortured in migrant crackdown win public apology,"Four indigenous Mexicans who were illegally detained and abused by immigration agents during a US-backed crackdown have received a rare public apology by the Mexican government for the ordeal. The group were on a bus of seasonal farmhands in central Mexico when apprehended in 2015 by immigration agents who targeted them because of their physical features, clothes and limited Spanish. The agents accused the four of being undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, but they were indigenous Tzeltal Mayans from the poor state of Chiapas in southern Mexico, where 25% of the population speak an indigenous language. Shortly after the ordeal, the Guardian revealed that three of the four – siblings aged 15 to 24 – were taken to a detention centre in Querétaro in central Mexico and held for eight days. One of them, then aged 18, was beaten and given electric shocks until he agreed to sign a deportation document admitting they were Guatemalan, even though he cannot read or write. The siblings narrowly avoided being expelled from their home country after the fourth – the older sister’s boyfriend – alerted a human rights organization. On Thursday, Mexico’s current immigration (INM) chief admitted they were subjected to human rights violations as a result of racial profiling. “On behalf of the National Migration Institute, I offer this public apology, for the transgression of their human rights, for the damage to their image, honor and dignity caused by the actions of the migration agents,” said Francisco Garduño Yáñez. Six immigration officials, who have not been named, were suspended for two to four weeks for their role in the abuse, Garduño said. The apology does not mention torture, even though the Human Rights Commission in Mexico City concluded that Alberto suffered post-traumatic psychological symptoms as a result of being tortured. “I really thought I was going to die, so I signed lots of sheets of paper – but I can’t read or write so I didn’t know what I was signing,” Alberto told the Guardian through a translator in 2016. At the time, the INM denied the incident ever happened. As part of its package of reparation measures, the INM has also pledged to stamp out racial profiling by training agents in cultural sensitivity and human rights: “The institute is committed to ensuring that human rights violations like these do not happen again,” Garduño said. The youngest victim, now 19, welcomed the news. “Good. That means my younger brothers and sisters will be able to travel to Sonora to work,” she told the Guardian through her lawyer. The supreme court will soon rule on the constitutionality of the current migration law, which permits agents to employ racial profiling on Mexican citizens who may not know the law, speak Spanish – or who are simply afraid of authorities, said Gretchen Kuhner, the director of Institute for Women in Migration (Imumi), one of the organizations representing the victims. Kuhner said: “The case demonstrates a larger pattern of abuse by INM agents who use racial profiling to harass indigenous and other Mexicans. In the current crackdown, Mexicans are even more vulnerable to these types of abuses by immigration agents and the new national guard.” In recent months, thousands of troops have been deployed to help the INM detain migrants as part of a controversial deal in which President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to stop more migrants reaching the US border to avoid punishing US trade tariffs."
2019-11-07T08:14:19Z,French police begin clearing makeshift migrant camp in Paris,"Hundreds of French police have begun clearing more than 1,000 migrants and refugees from a makeshift camp in northern Paris, where they had been sleeping rough in squalid conditions for months. Police arrived at the site near Porte de La Chapelle before 6am local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday, after the country’s centrist government set out Emmanuel Macron’s tougher stance on immigration this week and vowed to clear the camps. Within an hour the first buses had departed to take people temporarily to gyms and requisitioned buildings in the Paris region while immigration authorities check their status. Women and children were first in the queues, while men waited calmly to leave, some clutching bags of few belongings. More than 3,000 people had been sleeping on pavements and under bridges and canals in northern Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, with scant access to running water and no showers. Many had complained of rats, and charities had warned of appalling sanitary conditions. Some of those queuing for buses had refugee status but had not been able to find permanent accommodation. One such man from Sudan told France Info radio: “It is awful. I sleep outside, sometimes I eat, sometimes I don’t.” He said he expected to be taken to a makeshift shelter in a gymnasium. “But I really need a proper home, to get some training, to work. I want to live.” The problem of makeshift camps for migrants and asylum seekers forming on the streets of northern Paris is not new. There have been more than 30 clearances in the capital over the last four years, but each time hundreds more people end up back on the streets shortly after. Local politicians have said the problem is that the state does not offer proper accommodation and facilities for asylum seekers who are being processed. The Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has regularly accused Macron’s government of failing to provide help for the large number of people sleeping rough in the city. She said she had been given assurances from state authorities that those being evicted on Thursday would be found permanent accommodation. Hidalgo, observing the police clearance, said: “At last today a message is being sent that we have to have organised, dignified, humanitarian solutions.” She said it also sent a message to residents of the area that “you have not been abandoned”. In a sign of the state’s determination to stop people returning to sleep rough in the same part of the city, Michel Cadot, the head of Paris’s police force, said there would be a permanent police presence there “to stop these camps reforming. That is the new element compared to all the measures taken in the past,” he said. He described the evacuation of the camps as allowing the state to “take back the public space”. Police authorities described it as a “humanitarian” operation to take people to shelter. Other camps in northern Paris will be evacuated in the coming days."
2019-11-09T23:36:18Z,Hunt for migrants after boat spotted at Kent coast village,"Police were trying to track down a group of migrants late on Saturday night, who were seen arriving by boat on the Kent coast, renewing concerns about border security. They were spotted at the village of Seabrook, near Hythe, at 6am on Saturday, prompting a search operation involving police, Border Force officials and a Coastguard helicopter. The operation came as police in Essex started repatriating the bodies of the 39 people who died in the back of a refrigerated lorry last month. On Friday police released the names of the Vietnamese victims. Ten teenagers were among those found in the container, shipped from Belgium to Essex on 23 October. Anti-Slavery International said it was concerned about the numbers of young Vietnamese nationals being arrested by UK police, despite concerns that they may have been trafficked. Data from freedom of information requests sent by the charity to British police forces showed that 6,796 Vietnamese nationals were arrested between 2012 and 2018, including 1,127 children. Where the reason for arrest was recorded, more than 40% concerned an immigration offence and almost a third were in relation to drugs. “A major concern highlighted by the data is the high number of children being criminalised, many for immigration offences,” said an Anti-Slavery International spokesman. “This raises concerns as this research has identified that most children do not organise their own travel and are controlled by adults. Having irregular status is a significant indicator that they may be victims of trafficking.” Maurice Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland, who was driving the lorry in which the victims were found, was charged last month with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. At least 10 others have been arrested in Vietnam as the police investigation narrows on the origin of the smuggling network. Vietnamese smugglers have named the deadly route taken by those seeking to reach Britain as the “CO2” route: a poorly ventilated journey across the English Channel in containers or trailers, the last stage of their hazardous voyage from Asia. On Saturday, as the weather worsened, attention remained on the Kent coast following the early-morning report of Channel crossings. It follows two incidents on Friday where the Border Force intercepted 20 people in the Channel. The men from both boats were taken to Dover, the Home Office said, where they were expected to be medically assessed before being interviewed by immigration officials. On Wednesday Dutch police found 16 migrants, including four children, in a lorry that was about to board a ferry at a Dutch port heading for Britain. The occupants, reportedly of various nationalities, were found after the driver told border guards at the port of IJmuiden that he had heard sounds in the trailer of the lorry. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has said Britain should continue to attend EU meetings on migration."
2019-08-01T05:00:50Z,How the media contributed to the migrant crisis,"When did you notice the word “migrant” start to take precedence over the many other terms applied to people on the move? For me it was in 2015, as the refugee crisis in Europe reached its peak. While debate raged over whether people crossing the Mediterranean via unofficial routes should be regarded as deserving candidates for European sympathy and protection, it seemed as if that word came to crowd out all others. Unlike the other terms, well-meaning or malicious, that might be applied to people in similar situations, this one word appears shorn of context; without even an im- or an em- attached to it to indicate that the people it describes have histories or futures. Instead, it implies an endless present: they are migrants, they move, it’s what they do. It’s a form of description that, until 2015, I might have expected to see more often in nature documentaries, applied to animals rather than human beings. But only certain kinds of human beings. The professional who moves to a neighbouring city for work is not usually described as a migrant, and neither is the wealthy businessman who acquires new passports as easily as he moves his money around the world. It is most often applied to those people who fall foul of border control at the frontiers of the rich world, whether that’s in Europe, the US, Australia, South Africa or elsewhere. That’s because the terms that surround migration are inextricably bound up with power, as is the way in which our media organisations choose to disseminate them. The people I met during the years I spent reporting on the experiences of refugees at Europe’s borders, for my book Lights in the Distance, were as keenly aware of this as any of us. There was the fixer I was introduced to in Bulgaria, a refugee himself, who was offering TV news crews a “menu” of stories of suffering, with a price range that corresponded with the value the media placed on them. Caesar, a young man from Mali I met in Sicily, told me he was shocked to find that Italian television would usually only show images of Africa in reports about war or poverty. Some refugees’ stories, he felt, were treated with more urgency than others because of what country they came from. Or there was Hakima, an Afghan woman who lived with her family in Athens, who confronted me directly: “We keep having journalists visit, and they want to hear our stories, but, tell me, what can you do?” Often, people I met were surprised at the lack of understanding, even indifference, they felt was being shown to them. Didn’t Europe know why people like them were forced to make these journeys? Hadn’t Europe played an intimate role in the histories and conflicts of their own countries? * * * Europe’s refugee crisis, or more properly, a disaster partly caused by European border policies, rather than simply the movement of refugees towards Europe, was one of the most heavily mediated world events of the past decade. It unfolded around the edges of a wealthy and technologically developed region, home to several major centres of the global media industry. Scenes of desperation, suffering and rescue that might normally be gathered by foreign correspondents in harder-to-access parts of the world were now readily available to reporters, news crews, filmmakers and artists at relatively low cost. The people at the centre of the crisis were, at least for a time, relatively free to move around once they had reached safety and to speak to whoever they pleased. This gave certain advantages to the kind of media coverage that was produced. Most of all, it allowed quick and clear reporting on emergency situations as they developed. Throughout 2015, the crisis narrative was developed via a series of flashpoints at different locations within and around the European Union. In April, for example, attention focused on the smuggler boat route from Libya, after the deadliest shipwreck ever recorded in the Mediterranean. A month or so later focus shifted to Calais, where French and British policies of discouraging irregular migrants from attempting to cross the Channel had led to a growing spectacle of mass destitution. By the summer, the number of boat crossings from Turkey to Greece had dramatically increased, and images and stories of people stepping on to Aegean shores, or of piles of orange lifejackets, came to dominate. Then came the scenes of people moving through the Balkans, and so on, and so on. In all of these situations the news media were able to do their basic job in emergency situations, which is to communicate what’s happening, who’s affected, what’s needed the most. But this is usually more than a matter of relaying dry facts and figures. “Human stories” have the greatest currency among journalists, although it’s an odd term if you think about it. What stories aren’t human? In fact, it’s most commonly used to denote a particular kind of human story; one that gives individual experience the greatest prominence, that tells you what an event felt like, both physically and emotionally. It rests on the assumption that this is what connects most strongly with audiences: either because it hooks them in and keeps them watching or reading, or because it helps them identify with the protagonist, perhaps in a way that encourages empathy, or a particular course of action in response. As a result, the public was able to easily and quickly access vivid accounts and images of people’s experiences as they attempted to cross the EU’s external borders, or to find shelter and welcome within Europe. * * * The trade-off was that this often fit into predetermined ideas about what disasters look like, who needs protection, who is innocent and who is deserving of blame. Think, for example, about the most recognisable image of the refugee crisis in 2015: the picture of a Turkish police officer carrying the lifeless body of three-year-old Alan Kurdi away from the water’s edge on a beach near Bodrum. As the Dutch documentary Een zee van beelden – A Sea of Images – (Medialogica, 2016) asked: why did this image in particular strike such a chord? After all, many news editors see images of death on a daily basis, yet for the most part decide to exclude them. The documentary showed how the apparently viral spread of the Alan Kurdi photograph on social media was in large part the result of a series of decisions taken by senior journalists and NGO workers. First, a local photo agency in Turkey decided to release the image to the wires because they were so fed up with the lack of political response to the crisis on their shores. The image was shared by an official at a global human rights NGO with a large Twitter following, and retweeted by several prominent correspondents for large news organisations. Picture editors at several newspapers then decided, independently of one another, to place the photo on the front pages of their next editions; only after that point did it reach its widest circulation online. The image gained the status it did for a mix of reasons – political, commercial, but also aesthetic. One of the picture editors interviewed in the documentary commented on how the position of the figures in the photo resembled that of Michelangelo’s Pietà, an iconography of suffering and sacrifice that runs deep in European culture. But if this way of working has its advantages, it also has its dark side. News media that rush from one crisis point to another are not so good at filling in the gaps, at explaining the obscured systems and long-term failures that might be behind a series of seemingly unconnected events. To return to the idea of a “refugee crisis”, for example, this is an accurate description in one sense, as it involved a sharp increase in the number of people claiming asylum in the European Union; from around 430,000 in 2013, according to the EU statistics agency Eurostat, to well over a million in 2015 and 2016 each. In global terms this was a relatively small number of refugees: the EU has a population of over 500 million, while most of the world’s 68.5 million forcibly displaced people are hosted in poorer parts of the world. But the manner of people’s arrival was chaotic and often deadly, while there was a widespread institutional failure to ensure that their needs – for basic necessities, for legal and political rights – were met. To stop there, however, risks giving the false impression that the crisis was a problem from elsewhere that landed unexpectedly on European shores. * * * This impression is false on two counts. First, Europe has played a key role, historically, in the shaping of a world where power and wealth are unequally distributed, and European powers continue to pursue military and arms trading policies that have caused or contributed to the conflicts and instability from which many people flee. Second, the crisis of 2015 was a direct effect of the complex and often violent system of policing immigration from outside the EU that has been constructed in the last few decades. In short, this has involved the EU and its members signing treaties with countries outside its borders to control immigration on its behalf; an increasingly militarised frontier at the geographical edges of the EU; and an internal system for regulating the movement of asylum seekers that aims to force them to stay in the first EU country they enter. This, cumulatively, had the effect of forcing desperate people to take narrower and more dangerous routes by land and sea, while the prioritising of border control over safe and dignified reception conditions compounded the disaster. How well, really, did media organisations explain all this to their audiences? The effect, all too often, was to frame these newly arrived people as others; people from “over there”, who had little to do with Europe itself and were strangers, antagonistic even, to its traditions and culture. This was true at times, of both well-meaning and hostile media coverage. A sympathetic portrayal of the displaced might focus on some of those images and stories that matched stereotypes of innocence and vulnerability: children, women, families; the vulnerable, the sick, the elderly. Negative coverage, meanwhile, might focus more on the men, the able-bodied, nameless and sometimes faceless people massed at fences or gates. Or people from particular countries would be focused on to suit a political agenda. The Sun, one of Britain’s most widely read newspapers, for example, led with a picture of Alan Kurdi on its front page in September 2015, telling its readers that the refugee crisis was a matter of life and death, and that the immediate action required was further British military intervention in Syria. A few weeks later it gave another refugee boat story the front page, but in contrast to the earlier one the language was about “illegals” who were seeking a “back door”. This time, the refugees were from Iraq, and they had landed on the territory of a British air force base in Cyprus, which legally made them the responsibility of the UK. The fragmented and contradictory media coverage of the crisis left room for questions to go unanswered and myths to circulate: who are these people and what do they want from us? Why don’t they stop in the first safe country they reach? Why don’t the men stay behind and fight? How can we make room for everyone? Are they bringing their problems to our shores? Do they threaten our culture and values? The problem is made worse by those media outlets that have an active desire to stoke hostility and misunderstanding. * * * One of the first people I met in the course of my reporting was Azad, a young Kurdish man from northern Syria, in a hastily constructed refugee camp in Bulgaria at the end of 2013. At the time, the inability of Bulgarian and EU authorities to adequately prepare for the arrival of a few thousand people – the camp, at Harmanli in southern Bulgaria, marked the first time Médecins sans Frontières had ever set up emergency medical facilities within Europe – seemed like an unusual development. Everyone was new to this situation, and the camp’s inhabitants, largely Syrians who had fled the war there but decided that Syria’s neighbouring countries could not offer them the security they needed, were shocked at what they found. Several of them told me this couldn’t possibly be the real Europe, and that they would continue moving until they found it. Azad was friendly and wanted to know lots about where I came from, London, and to find out what he could about the other countries in Europe, and where people like him might find a place to settle. I went back to meet Azad several times over the next two years, as he and his family made their way across Bulgaria, and then central Europe, to Germany. During that time, the backlash against refugees grew stronger, a fact Azad was keenly aware of. In Sofia, in the spring of 2014, he pointed out places in the city centre where homeless Syrians had been attacked by street gangs. Later that year, in eastern Germany, we walked through a town where lampposts were festooned with posters for a far-right political party. By the autumn of 2015, Azad and his family were settled in Germany’s Ruhr area, and he was much warier of me than he had been in our early meetings. He could see that hostility ran alongside the curiosity and welcome that had greeted the new arrivals to Europe; and he knew how giving too many details away to journalists could threaten what stability people in his situation had managed to find. Within a few months, a series of events – the Islamic State attack in Paris in November 2015, the robberies and sexual assaults in Cologne that New Year’s Eve – had provided the excuse for some media outlets to tie well-worn stereotypes about savage, dark foreigners and their alleged threat to white European purity to the refugees of today. The most brazen of these claims – such as the Polish magazine wSieci, which featured a white woman draped in the EU flag being groped at by the arms of dark-skinned men, under the headline The Islamic Rape of Europe – directly echoed the Nazi and fascist propaganda of Europe’s 20th century. But racist stereotyping was present in more liberal outlets too. The Süddeutsche Zeitung, in its coverage of the Cologne attacks, prominently featured an illustration of a woman’s legs silhouetted in white, with the space in between taken up by a black arm and hand. Racism is buried so deep in European history that at times like these it can remain unspoken yet still make its presence clear. * * * Now, several years on from the peak of the refugee crisis, we are faced with a series of uncomfortable facts. The EU has tried to restore and strengthen the border system that existed before 2015 by extending migration control deep into Africa and Asia. The human rights of the people this affects, not least the many migrants trapped in horrendous conditions in Libya, are taking a back seat. Far right and nationalist movements have made electoral gains in many countries within the EU, and they have done this partly by promising to crack down on migration, to punish refugees for daring to ask for shelter from disasters that Europe was all too often the midwife to. Politicians of the centre are being pulled to the right by these developments, and a dangerous narrative threatens to push out all others: that European culture and identity are threatened by intrusions from outside. If we come to view culture in this way – as something fixed and tightly bounded by the ideologies of race and religion, or as a means for wealthy parts of the world to defend their privilege – then we are headed for further, greater disasters. The irony is that you can only believe in this vision if you ignore not only Europe’s history, but its present too. Movement, exchange, new connections, the making and remaking of tradition – these things are happening all around us, and already involve people who have been drawn here from other parts of the world by ties not just of conflict but of economics, history, language and technology. By the same token, displacement is not just a feature of the lives of people from elsewhere in the world; it’s been a major and recent part of Europe’s history too. And what has kept people alive, what has preserved traditions and allowed people to build identities and realise their potential, is solidarity: the desire to defend one another and work towards common goals. If there is a failure to recognise this, then the way people are represented by our media and cultural institutions has to be at fault, and setting this right is an urgent challenge. This isn’t only in terms of how people are represented and when, but who gets to participate in the decision-making; who gets to speak with authority, or with political intent, or with a collective voice rather than simply as an individual. All too often, the voices of refugees and other marginalised people are reduced to pure testimony, which is then interpreted and contextualised on their behalf. One thing that constantly surprised me about the reporting on refugees in Europe, for instance, was how little we heard from journalists who had connections to already settled diaspora communities. Immigration from Africa, Asia or the Middle East is hardly new to Europe, and this seems like a missed opportunity to strengthen bridges we have already built. Though it’s never too late. Any meaningful response to this has to address the question of who gets to tell stories, as well as what kinds of stories are told. The Refugee Journalism Project, a mentoring scheme for displaced journalists, based at London College of Communication – disclosure: I’m on the steering committee, and it is supported by the Guardian Foundation – focuses not only on providing people with a media platform, but helping them develop the skills and contacts necessary for getting jobs. All too often the second part is forgotten about. But although initiatives like these are encouraging, we also need to rethink the way our media organisations are run: who owns them, who makes the decisions, who does the work. This reminds me of what I heard Fatima, a women’s rights activist originally from Nigeria, tell an audience of NGO workers in Italy in 2016: “Don’t just come and ask me questions and sell my story or sell my voice; we need a change.” The more those of us who work in media can help develop the connections that already exist between us, the more I think we can break down the idea of irreconcilable conflict over migration. Because, really, there is no “over there” – just where we are. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.

2019-11-25T06:00:44Z,All migrants deserve support – not just the ‘good’ ones  | Furaha Asani,"Three months ago, I was told I was very likely to be deported. After six years living and working in the UK, I received a letter that said my visa had been refused, and I wouldn’t even be allowed to begin a new role at the University of Leicester. Naturally, I have been living in limbo ever since, pressing pause on my life and career while I seek a resolution. This isn’t the first time a case like mine has sprung up – recently the Cambridge sociologist Asiya Islam was told she may have to leave the UK by the end of January. Several other international academics have also been refused UK visas this year, either for themselves or their children. My case was featured in this newspaper, and in the hours that followed I was inundated with messages I could not keep up with: outrage, solidarity, so many questions, and media requests from far and wide. In the weeks since, I have received support from my union, as well as MPs and representatives from several universities, and even had my case raised in the House of Commons. All this is very much appreciated and not taken for granted. It has kept me going and served as motivation to see this through to the end. But on a personal level, the past month has also brought about deep reflection and critical evaluation of my relative privilege. When I first decided to go public with my story, I emphasised that I did not want to be seen as a “good immigrant” set apart from other migrants – an academic whose deportation was unjust by virtue of my profession or class. As Nikesh Shukla and other writers of colour have pointed out, it is dangerous to suggest that certain histories of work make any person more “deserving” of citizenship. Both an academic and an unemployed person who has fled conflict have equal right to appeal for a place to live. Nonetheless, many of the talking points surrounding my case have focused on my academic career. Many well-meaning people have expressed their disbelief that the work I have done – in research, teaching and writing – has not spared me this experience. I am certainly proud of my academic achievements, scholarship, outreach, science communication and writing around issues in higher education and healthcare. I also still believe I have more to offer academia in the UK. But at the same time, I know that these achievements do not position me as being more worthy of immigration justice than the many other migrants who become caught up in the system for years. My story, and those of other migrant academics in similar precarity, are not the first cases of injustice within the UK immigration system, and they certainly won’t be the last. Since my situation became public, many others have reached out to share their experiences. Some have been academics and some have fled from conflict in their countries. People have told me about how they have spent years pursuing documentation, accruing thousands of pounds in fees, as well as enduring the implications that all of this can have on a person’s career, family, emotional state and physical health. I have also met grassroots activists who help migrants integrate into their communities, making me aware of how my case fits into the hostile environment more broadly. It is heartening to see greater public awareness around the injustices migrants face, but our outrage is still often selective. This is partly because we overlook important considerations, such as the foundational role colonialism and present-day coloniality play in migration. Ambalavaner Sivanandan once succinctly stated: “We are here because you were there.” Meanwhile, homophobic laws, which in many countries are a colonial import, may lead to people seeking refuge in countries with more inclusive laws. “Western geopolitics” have also contributed to the destabilisation of some of the countries from which migrants flee. When we divorce these historical narratives from our everyday conversations around migration, we ignore the real reasons why so many people with less privilege than me are forced to migrate. To have these conversations responsibly and critically, we need to reflect on why we view cases differently, interrogating everything from who gets to be called an expat rather than a migrant, to our lack of education around global history. The potential impacts of this differential approach cannot be overstated. We know that some people’s cases are swiftly resolved after media attention – but what about those with whom the media and the general public do not always sympathise? I still do not know if I will be deported in the coming months. My current situation is immensely strenuous. But it is also an opportunity for me to take the solidarity I have received, and to pass it forward to those who have been pushed even further into the margins. It is my responsibility to use my voice and any platform I have to challenge our collective thinking about exactly who we believe should be afforded safety and citizenship. My situation is unjust – but we shouldn’t forget that all migrants deserve the right to justice. • Furaha Asani is a post-doctoral researcher, teacher, mental health advocate and writer"
2019-12-31T07:00:29Z,"'Looking back, I realise I was naive': reporting on the refugee crisis","There was a tangible sense in 2016 that, if only the world knew what was happening, we would rise to tackle the challenge of the refugee crisis. I never thought that three years on little would have changed. In fact, the situation in Greece seems more bleak than ever. Looking back, I realise I was naive. We have not only failed, we have broken promises. Britain pledged to take 3,000 unaccompanied minors. We have taken just over 200. The conditions in the camps are squalid and chaotic. Interviewing people in their temporary homes, I started to imagine sharing a tiny tent, a space not big enough to stand up in, with my five family members. Even the thought is unfathomable. The first person I interviewed was a 24-year-old Afghan woman who had lost her sister on the journey from Afghanistan to Greece. As I watched tears stream down her face, I had to hold back my own. I hate asking the same reductive questions to each person I meet - “Where are you from?” “Why did you leave?” - knowing that what they say will never do justice to the pain and hardship of their journey. What I really wanted to ask everyone I met was “How do you survive here?”, but the words wouldn’t leave my lips for fear I would alienate them. Masouma Ibrahimi, 42, Afghanistan with Ali Aghbar, seven, and Ali Akbar, two. I weaved through muddy tracks in the tiny spaces between cramped tents, with a crisscross of cables above providing enough energy for a small light in each tent. Everywhere I looked, kids played in filth. I counted just two sets of portable cabin toilets for almost 13,000 people. Next to them, a pile of rubbish as tall as me. I was heartbroken to hear from countless women that they were unable go to the toilet alone at night for fear of being raped. Fatima Hosseini, 25 I met a 25-year-old Afghan woman called Fatima Hosseini. I will never forget her words. Practically speechless, I said softly: “I’m so sorry.” She replied: “Everyone comes here and says sorry. I hate this word.” I took her portrait, knowing I may not be able to give her anything in return. Mohammad Rezwani and his family It’s hard not to be acutely aware that at the end of the day, I was able to leave the horrors of the camp behind. I never quite shake off the discomfort of such an unjust imbalance of power. Moria is an old military base designed to house 3,000 people, but it’s home to more than 14,000. Makeshift hairdressers and market stalls were a few reminders of civilisation in the chaos of everyday life in the camp. Many Greek people have been unsung heroes on the frontline of the crisis, but the national mood has grown increasingly hostile to refugees. The volunteers I met, many of them Greek, were exhausted. The strain on those living on the islands is evident. On some of the islands the number of migrants is now equal or close to the number of residents. Tensions will only grow as these conditions are allowed to worsen. Locking people up indefinitely is not a solution. We must see a serious commitment from the Greek government to put a place in plan to provide asylum and routes to resettlement. However, Greece must not be left alone to provide an adequate immigration policy. This is a collective European problem that needs a collective European response. Refugees arriving on Greek shores have fled violence and untold horrors. They do not deserve to be met with detention, hostility and further suffering. Yassin Raqyar, 27, and Massouma The photo of Alan Kurdi symbolised the power of photography to capture the world’s attention, even for a brief moment. The three-year-old’s tragic death inspired the establishment of the remarkable grassroots organisation Help Refugees, and was ultimately a catalyst for the work I do now. I wish I could say his death had been a wakeup call for us all, but since 2015 we have turned a blind eye as the Mediterranean has become the most dangerous border in the world. I have felt increasingly disillusioned, but I hope I never lose faith in the power of the image. Hope also comes from the actions of the grassroots groups on the Greek islands providing the most basic services where governments are failing. The brave heroes who have crowdfunded for rescue boats and now patrol the seas saving lives every week. The volunteers who have been the sole provider of toilets, showers and taps in and around the Moria camp for the last few years. The teachers, doctors and dentists who leave their homes across Europe and volunteer in their holidays to help others. Hope comes from those around the world who still care. It is only by recognising our shared humanity that we accept our moral responsibility to those knocking at Europe’s door. It is ultimately a test of our character. Help Refugees supports over 100 projects across Europe, the Middle East and on the US-Mexico border, working with local partners and over 30,000 volunteers to provide aid and long-term solutions to improve the lives of refugees."
2019-09-30T05:30:58Z,Pride and prejudice: the best books on the refugee experience,"The refugee story doesn’t end at asylum and safety, the moment when many readers look away. It is an endless battle with pride, shame, identity and especially language. I can’t imagine a worse way to begin it than as a teenage girl. No memoir captures my own post-asylum years like Eva Hoffman’s 1989 account of adolescence as a clever but foreign girl (a child of Holocaust survivors relocating to Canada) with no money and a heap of desires. Lost in Translation was published the year I arrived in the US from Iran (via Dubai and Italy), in a way similar to Hoffman: a child with no choice, old enough to struggle with English, habits, shame. I could have used the book then. I didn’t discover it until I was at college, but its truth stung me again and again until I was numb, and delirious with the joy of being understood – not by just any immigrant girl, but by a Harvard graduate, and a former editor of the New York Times Book Review. Every refugee has escaped from something, often unthinkable. Among ourselves, exiles know the best way to tell stories is with comedy. Mazen Maarouf’s Jokes for the Gunmen is a hilarious and bizarre portrait of childhood in wartime. These tales show the strangeness of the world through young eyes, and given their indistinct sense of place, they evoke many childhoods and many funny families (including mine). Maarouf’s power comes from knowing that humans will persist in their absurdity even to the point of death. For a rigorous journalistic understanding of today’s primary migrant route into Europe (through the western Balkans), I recommend BBC correspondent Nick Thorpe’s The Road Before Me Weeps. It is an intimate, heartbreaking account of daily life in transit, in this particular social and political context, and of the many ways these families are rejected and exploited along the way. I was blown away by how much this man saw – things that have taken me 30 years of reflection to be willing to talk about. One of the most infuriating distinctions made in today’s refugee debate is between refugees and economic migrants, who are often young men depicted as opportunists. In his novel Nowhere Man, Aleksandar Hemon dares to give the unpalatable immigrant boy a place. Here is Jozef, who arrived in Chicago before the siege of Sarajevo and must now watch his home turn to ruins, without even the designation of refugee as shelter. “I am complicated,” he says, as he struggles with a new identity thrust upon him by fate. The displacement narrative must naturally end with the gaze falling back on to home, and with the futility of return, the condition of permanent psychic exile. Anton Gill’s The Journey Back from Hell is a powerful collection of oral testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, a symphony of old trauma and grief, and a complex depiction of the impossibility of going back. Literature is a means of calling out to others to share our truest stories. Lately, I have my eyes on No Friend But the Mountains, Behrouz Boochani’s memoir of his flight and incarceration on Manus Island, which he wrote on a phone and smuggled out of the prison. Boochani is still confined, his past out of reach, his future unknowable. I send him solidarity from this side of our intersecting saga. And a warning from Rilke: “Beware o wanderer, the road is walking too.” • The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (£16.99).

2019-12-17T13:31:20Z,Qatar World Cup chief insists progress being made on migrant rights,"The Qatari official in charge of organising the most controversial edition of the football World Cup since the tournament’s inception in 1930 has claimed that criticism of his country’s treatment of migrant workers will have a ripple effect that will improve regional labour standards. The 2022 World Cup has been dogged by criticism of its host’s kafala system, which ties migrant workers to so-called sponsorship by their employer, meaning they cannot move jobs or leave the country without the employer’s approval. In an interview in the Qatari capital, Doha, Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the supreme committee organising the event, said he wanted reforms to apply not just to workers employed on World Cup projects but across Qatar and more widely. “There are already signs of reforms being picked up in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia,” he said. The International Labour Organisation has said it expects the reforms to be implemented in January. The abolition of kafala, he said, would mean “every person living in the country has the freedom to move from one job to another and can live their lives, change jobs whenever they want and leave the country as they want.” Qatar says it is also planning labour market reforms, including introducing elected “workers’ welfare forums” to raise complaints with employers, and a more than 50% rise in the minimum wage. Qatar has announced it is planning labour market reforms, including introducing “workers’ welfare forums” to raise complaints with employers and a substantial rise in the minimum wage. International sources say the rise is likely to be over 50%. It would be the first Gulf State to apply a national uniform minimum wage that disregards nationality and will not be just applicable to construction workers. Thawadi would not be drawn on the specifics. “The rise in the minimum wage is something I am excited about, but the details of where they are at I am not entirely familiar with or aware.” All Gulf states make heavy use of low-paid migrant labour, often from India. In the case of Qatar, the indigenous population now makes up only 10% of the country’s total of 2.8 million people. The Indian population of 700,000 alone dwarfs the number of locals. A report by Amnesty International in September said thousands of migrant workers were still being exploited in Qatar despite repeated promises to improve workers’ rights. Dismantling Qatar’s exploitative labour market – with its echoes of slavery, which was only abolished there in the 1950s – could have huge repercussions not just for Qatar’s rapidly evolving society but for Gulf economies as a whole. Thawadi claimed that some of the criticism levelled at Qatar since it won the right to stage the World Cup a decade ago had been “ill-informed, cynical or even vicious”. This week Qatar is hosting Liverpool FC among other clubs in the Club World Cup, a tournament seen as a chance to test newly built infrastructure including a 37-station metro system, match scheduling and the overall fan experience. October’s World Athletics Championships in Doha were marked by rows and rows of empty seats and complaints from athletes about a lack of atmosphere. Thawadi said lessons have been learned and with 1.5 million fans due to visit for the World Cup, lack of enthusiasm would not be an issue. “Football and the World Cup can break down stereotypes. The passion for this game like no other creates a bond and bridges gaps,” he said. World Cup organisers have repeatedly warned fans that they will have to be respectful of Qatar’s local laws and customs, including a ban on homosexuality. Thawadi, a football fan who admires Liverpool and what he called its “leftwing fanbase”, said meetings with community groups such as Spirit of Shankly and Kop Outs, an LGBT supporters’ club, had averted an embarrassing boycott of this week’s event. Nevertheless, he said LGBT fans would be welcome only if they refrained from “public displays of affection”. He said alcohol would be on sale in specified fan zones and in hotels but not on street corners. “Alcohol is not part of our culture but hospitality is.” A “sin tax” has raised the price of beer to £10 a pint, an issue Thawadi said needed addressing. But he regarded such matters as a two-way street. “Let us try to understand each other as human beings,” he said. “We are a conservative culture, not a closed culture.” Houtan Homayounpour, the Doha chief for ILO, a UN employment rights agency that has been working on reforms with the Qatar government since 2017, said progress was being made but there were “many more milestones to pass”. Homayounpour cited the heat-related death toll among migrant workers, a lack of autopsies and delays in payment of wages as areas of concern. The flow of information to the families of dead and injured workers has been mixed. For instance, the family of Zac Cox, a British worker who died when he fell from a gantry, struggled for many months to extract information on the circumstances of his death. Only after relentless pressure did Thawadi’s committee set up a British judge-led inquiry. Thawadi said he was committed to implementing the inquiry’s findings. “We don’t want Zac’s death to go without us learning or contributing to the welfare of other people,” he said. Thawadi, 41, a former law student at Sheffield University, said the labour reforms were intended not just to help Qatar survive the current glare of publicity. “None of the work we have done is to satisfy the spotlight or the critics,” he said. “Our nation’s commitment is that these will be sustainable changes. Yes, some people have criticised the pace, but you need to build the foundations before you live in a house.” • This article was amended on 21 December 2019. The original suggested that Hassan al-Thawadi said the labour market reforms would be implemented in January. It is actually the International Labour Organisation that has said it expects the changes to take place next month."
2019-10-31T13:49:16Z,Italy to renew anti-migration deal with Libya,"Italy is to renew its deal with the UN-backed government in Libya under which the Libyan coastguard stops migrant boats at sea and sends their passengers back to the north African country, where aid agencies say they face torture and abuse. The foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, told the lower house of parliament it would be “unwise for Italy to break off its agreement with Libya on handling asylum seekers and combating human trafficking”. The deal was agreed in February 2017 in an attempt to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Sicily’s shores. Italy agreed to train, equip and finance the Libyan coastguard, including providing four patrol vessels. The deal, due to expire on Saturday, will be renewed automatically unless one of the parties opts out. Di Maio said: “The document can be amended but it is undeniable that it has reduced the number of arrivals and deaths at sea.” Sources close to the Italian government said amendments should include evacuation programmes to resettle asylum seekers and measures to ensure the presence of humanitarian organisations in Libyan detention centres. It is not clear whether Tripoli would agree to such changes. Médecins Sans Frontières said the proposed changes would serve only to “perpetuate policies of rejection and detention” in Libya. “The only possible solution is to completely overcome the arbitrary detention system and end the support offered to the Libyan authorities that feed suffering, violations of international law and the odious work of smugglers,” said Marco Bertotto, MSF’s head of advocacy. Early in October the Italian newspaper Avvenire revealed that a man described as one of the world’s most notorious human traffickers attended a series of meetings in Italy in May 2017 between Italian officials and a Libyan delegation to discuss controls on migration flows from north Africa. The alleged trafficker, Abd al-Rahman Milad, nicknamed Bija, is a captain of the Libyan coastguard."
2019-09-24T23:28:41Z,Coalition blocking release of major review into refugee resettlement,"The Morrison government is sitting on a major review it commissioned last year to explore better ways of resettling humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review into integration, employment, and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants, was led by Prof Peter Shergold, the former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, now coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW. Guardian Australia understands the final report was delivered to government in February but the immigration minister, David Coleman, does not intend to release it until the end of this year, when it’s expected to be published along with the government’s response. The government has repeatedly refused requests for both the report and for an explanation of why it hasn’t been released. Shergold was tasked with developing recommendations to improve policy and “better ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy,” said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, at the time of the December announcement. Attempts by the opposition to obtain the report under freedom of information laws were refused on the grounds that the document is exempted as being “cabinet in confidence”. The refusal letter confirmed the document either has not yet been submitted to cabinet or is still being considered. Guardian Australia has also sought to obtain the document under FOI. Andrew Giles, the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, said the review was one “most Australians would welcome”. “It serves a really important purpose, but what’s really perplexing is that it’s been kept secret … when there’s no explanation for why this is the case,” Giles said. At the time the review was announced, there was sector-wide concern over its short timeframe of just two and a half months over the summer period. The review received submissions from groups including from the Refugee Health Network, the Australian College of Nursing, the Settlement Council of Australia (SCoA), the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (Fecca). “Many stakeholders, including Fecca, made significant contributions to the Shergold report with a view to improving the settlement process for refugees so they can fully, and more quickly, participate in society,” said Fecca chairperson, Mary Patetsos. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We look forward to reading the report and seeing how the government responds to the recommendations.” Chief executive of the SCoA, Tammy Wolffs, said it was disappointing the report hadn’t been released before another inquiry into regional resettlement had begun in the meantime. Wolffs said if the Shergold report had been released it could have informed the current inquiry. She said they hoped the “closely guarded” report would lead to more integrated services. “We think it will have quite big implications for the sector … and how it’s funded,” she said. “There was a shakeup recently of the way settlement services have been funded and we can see there are better opportunities for integration and funding of settlement services, and the services and opportunities our sector can provide to refugees and other migrants who come through.” Labor’s Giles said the government was releasing policy which “clearly goes to the scope of the review”, and questioned whether those policies were based on the evidence the government had commissioned from the review. He noted a speech given by the federal minister for population, Alan Tudge, on Thursday, in which he flagged incentives for humanitarian entrants to move to the regions to reduce pressure on cities. The federal government has already reduced the migration program cap to 160,000 and dedicated 23,000 places for regional skilled migrations. “[This report is] a bit of work which would inform exactly this, and it’s either not being looked at or is being hidden from the Australian public,” said Giles. Rural Australians for Refugees told the review its proposition that more refugees and secondary migrants will be settled in the regions “represents both enormous and positive opportunities but also some challenges”. It recommended place-based and needs-based programs, with rural and regional resettlement decisions respecting community identities and avoiding “metro-centric and top-down program approaches”. Among the submissions, several organisations noted complicated health needs for new humanitarian entrants and difficulties navigating support systems and accessing bulk-billing regional GPs, as well as problems with the current provision of language education, job assistance, and recognising existing skills and qualifications. Poor communication between government departments responsible for resettling new entrants was also noted. There were also repeated mentions of the need for the government to actively change the current negative narrative around refugees and humanitarian entrants. “All Australians benefit when these migrants are fully welcomed into our workplaces, economies and communities,” said the Centre for Policy Development. A spokeswoman for Coleman did not answer questions, instead saying: “the Government is considering the report and will provide its response in due course.”"
2019-09-05T17:36:45Z,UK must stay part of refugee family reunion route | Letters,"I am alarmed by the suggestion that the UK would drop out of the system that allows asylum-seeking children to reunite with family members in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit (Refugee children ‘at risk’ from no deal, 2 September). While the impact this would have on unaccompanied children is particularly distressing, it would also affect many other refugees including husbands and wives, brothers and sisters. Over 1,000 people were reunited with family members in this country through the Dublin system last year. It is vital that the government sets up contingency measures so that families do not risk being stranded in separate countries after 31 October. If this route will no longer be open, it’s more urgent than ever that ministers make our domestic family reunion rules fairer. Allowing refugees to reunite with their loved ones provides a lifeline from dangerous and degrading conditions, and makes it easier for refugees to integrate and lead dignified lives again. Danny Sriskandarajah Chief executive, Oxfam GB • The plight of children separated from their parents is one of the many terrible aspects of the migration policy crisis and the Dublin regulation is one effective way of dealing with this problem. In recent months at Arhag, a BAME housing association in London working with migrants and refugees, we have dealt with four such cases helping to reunite children with parents in the UK. Few would oppose schemes that bring torn-apart families back together . The consequence of ending the route provided by the Dublin system will mean more perilous crossings and more tragedies for families who are trying to be reunited.

2019-11-03T08:14:09Z,"Torture, rape and murder: inside Tripoli’s refugee detention camps","Men press anxious faces against the chicken-wire fence of Triq-al-Sikka migrant detention camp in downtown Tripoli as I enter. “Welcome to hell,” says a Moroccan man, without a smile. Triq-al-Sikka is home to 300 men penned into nightmare conditions. Several who are sick lie motionless on dirty mattresses in the yard, left to die or recover in their own time. Three of the six toilets are blocked with sewage, and for many detainees, escape is out of the question as they have no shoes. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. After reports of torture and abuse in detention centres, and wanting to stop the flow of people across the Mediterranean, the European Union has since 2016 poured more than £110m into improving conditions for migrants in Libya. But things are now worse than before. Among the inmates is Mohammed, from Ghana. In July, he survived an air strike on another centre, in Tajoura on the capital’s south-western outskirts, that killed 53 of his fellow migrants. After surviving on the streets, last month he got a place on a rickety smuggler boat heading for Europe. But it was intercepted by the coastguard. Mohammed fell into the sea and was brought back to this camp. His blue jumper is still stained by sea salt. He is desperate to get word to his wife. “The last time we spoke was the night I tried to cross the sea,” he says. “The soldiers took my money and phone. My wife does not know where I am, whether I am alive or dead.” Triq-al-Sikka’s conditions are harsh, but other centres are worse. Inmates tell of camps where militias storm in at night, dragging migrants away to be ransomed back to their families. Tens of thousands of migrants are spread across this city, many sleeping in the streets. Dozens bed down each night under the arches of the city centre’s freeway. Since April, in a sharp escalation of the civil war, eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar has been trying to batter his way into the city in fighting that has left more than 1,000 dead and left tens of thousands of citizens homeless. Libya has known nothing but chaos since the 2011 revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. In 2014, a multi-sided civil war broke out. Taking advantage of this chaos, smugglers transformed Libya into a hub for migrants from three continents trying to reach Europe. But after more than half a million arrivals, European governments have tightened the rules. This clampdown is obvious at the gates of a nondescript fenced compound holding white shipping containers in the city centre. It is the UN’s refugee Gathering and Departure Facility, nicknamed Hotel GDF by the migrants. From here, a select few who qualify for asylum get flights via Niger and Rwanda to Europe. But there are 45,000 registered migrants, and in the past year only 2,300 seats on flights for migrants – which have now stopped altogether, with Europe offering no more places. Yet dozens line up outside each day hoping for that magical plane ticket. Among those clustered at the fence is Nafisa Saed Musa, 44, who has been a refugee for more than half her life: In 2003, her village in Sudan’s Darfur region was burned down. Her husband and two of her three sons were killed and she fled. After years spent in a series of African refugee camps with her son Abdullah, 27, she joined last year with 14 other Sudanese families, pooling their money, and headed for Libya. In southern Libya, Abdullah was arrested by a militia who demanded 5,000 dinars (£2,700) to release him. It took two months to raise the cash, and Abdullah shows marks of torture inflicted on him, some with a branding iron, some with cigarettes. They all left a charity shelter after local residents complained about the presence of migrants, and now Nafisa and her son sleep on the street on dirty mattresses, scrounging cardboard to protect from the autumnal rains, across the street from Hotel GDF. “I have only one dream: a dignified life. I dream of Europe for my son.” Nearby is Namia, from Sudan, cradling her six-month-old baby daughter, clad in a pink and white babygrow. Her husband was kidnapped by a militia in February and never seen again and she makes frequent trips here asking the UN to look for him. “I hope he is in a detention centre, I hope he is alive.” Last week, 200 migrants, kicked out of a detention camp in the south of Tripoli, marched on Hotel GDF and forced their way inside, joining 800 already camped there, in a base designed to hold a maximum of 600. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which administers the centre, says it has no more flights, unless outside states offer asylum places: “We cannot reinforce the asylum systems there because it is a country at war,” says UNHCR official Filippo Grandi. Meanwhile, escape by sea is being closed off, thanks to a controversial deal Italy made with Libya two years ago, in which Rome has paid €90m to train the coastguard. The deal has drastically cut arrivals in Italy from 181,000 in 2016 to 9,300 so far this year, with the coastguard intercepting most smuggling craft and sending migrants on board to detention camps. “We have collected testimonies of torture, rape and murder in detention camps,” says Oxfam’s Paolo Pezzati. “The agreement the Italian government signed with Libya in February 2017 has allowed these untold violations.” Rome has faced criticism because among the coastguard leaders whose units it funds is Abd al-Rahman Milad, despite his being accused by the UN of being involved in sinking migrant boats and collaborating with people-smugglers. Tripoli says it issued an arrest warrant against him in April, but this is news to Milad. Bearded, well-built and uniformed, he tells me he is back at work and is innocent: “I have nothing to do with trafficking, I am one of the best coastguards in Libya.” For migrants and Libyans alike, the outside world’s attitude is a puzzle: it sends aid and scolds Libya for mistreatment, yet offers no way out for migrants. “You see [UN officials] on television, shouting that they no longer want to see people die at sea. I wonder what is the difference between seeing them dying in the sea and letting them die in the middle of a street?” says Libyan Red Crescent worker Assad al-Jafeer, who tours the streets offering aid to migrants. “The men risk being kidnapped and forced to fight by militias, the women risk being taken away and sexually abused.” Recent weeks have seen nightly bombing in an air war waged with drones. Women, fearing rape, often sleep on the streets close to police stations for safety, but this brings new danger. “They think 50 metres from a police base is close enough to protect themselves,” says al-Jafeer. “But they are the first targets to be bombed.” Interior ministry official Mabrouk Abdelahfid was appointed six months ago and tasked with closing or improving detention centres, but admits reform is slow. He says many camps are outside government control and that the UN has provided no alternative housing for migrants when camps close: “We have already closed three [detention] centres. We believe that in the nine centres under our formal control there are more or less 6,000 people.” A common theme among migrants here is a crushing sense of being unwanted and of no value, seen even by aid agencies as an inconvenience. For now, migrants can only endure, with no end in sight for the war. Haftar and Tripoli’s defenders continue slugging it out along a front line snaking through the southern suburbs and few diplomats expect a breakthrough at peace talks being hosted in Berlin later this month. Outside Hotel GDF, dusk signals the end of another day with no news of flights and the migrants trudge away to sleep on the streets. To the south, the flashes from the night’s bombardment light up the sky."
2019-11-17T06:00:09Z,Government ‘exploits migrants for profit’ by outsourcing visa services to private firms,"The government has been accused of exploiting migrants for profit and leaving them in legal limbo after its visa application services were outsourced to private firms. The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA) says that those seeking to work or settle in the UK are being pressed into paying premium rates for a fast-track service that does not reliably deliver. Visa services for overseas applicants were outsourced to a Dubai-based firm, VFS, in 2014 and the process for those applying for residency permits was handed over to a French company, Spora Steria, last year. Home Office revenues from overseas visa applications have soared ninefold to £1.6bn after VFS took over and much of the income is from heavily promoted add-on services such as fast-tracking and document checking. Applicants are warned that they must wait six months for a decision unless they pay an additional premium of up to £800 for a 24-hour “super priority” service. “We are concerned that these services may exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants, who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit,” said ILPA chief executive Nicole Francis. “The contract between UKVI and the subcontractors may have resulted in UK Visa and Immigration [UKVI] benefiting financially from the selling of additional services to customers.” A shortage of free appointments for those already in the UK has forced some to pay the fee to renew their residency permit before their visas expire. However, the prominent promotions of priority services on the government website do not specify that the 24-hour timescale applies only to the decision about a visa application, not to how long it will take to receive a biometric residency permit (BRP). These hold a person’s fingerprints and photograph on a secure chip, and can be used to confirm information on work and benefits entitlements. The delays by the Home Office and its subcontractors are leaving some applicants unable to work or leave the country for weeks after they have paid the premium. Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo, a university research fellow from Mexico, paid £2,350 to extend his work visa, including £500 for the priority service to avoid the six-month wait. Over two months later he was still awaiting his residency permit after it was delivered to the wrong address by DX, the courier contracted by the UKVI. He was told that he could not contact the Home Office directly, and that since its subcontracted helpline has no access to application details his only option was to apply again. He was obliged to pay another £1,135 in priority fees as no free appointments were available and DX was unable to locate his office block. “Royal Mail, Amazon, even Asda manage to deliver to my building, which happens to be a conspicuous national research facility – and they charge £4.50 or so for a delivery,” he says. “The Home Office cannot manage the same feat for £3,485.20.” His request for his priority fees to be refunded was refused. UKVI instead advised him to change his delivery address, which he is unable to do because DX can’t provide a tracking number for the order. “No one should be treated and squeezed for money like this, regardless of where they are born,” he says. “My experience shows how little the Home Office cares about the applications it receives for work visas, the fantastically large sums of money involved in the process and the lack of channels to appeal against flagrant negligence.” His BRP eventually arrived via Royal Mail after the Observer intervened. The Home Office told the Observer that he was not due a refund of his priority fees since both applications had been processed on time and the delays were due to delivery errors. A DX spokesperson said: “We are obviously very disappointed that Mr Lozada-Hidalgo had a poor experience with our delivery service and we wish to apologise to him. We have looked into the matter and have identified steps to improve our service in the light of his experience.”"
2019-11-17T23:25:41Z,39  migrants detained after four boats stopped near Dover,"A total of 39 people have been detained after four small boats were intercepted attempting to cross the English Channel. The boats were discovered near Dover early on Sunday morning, with officials first being alerted to a vessel carrying nine people at 4.30am. Border Force officials made a second interception at 6am, when a vessel carrying five people was found. Between 7am and 7.30am a further two boats were intercepted, with 11 people on the first and 14 on the second. All 39 presented themselves as Iranian nationals, a government spokesperson said. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “Border Force dealt with four incidents on November 17 after being alerted to small boats travelling across the Channel towards the UK. The people from all boats were taken to Dover, where they were medically assessed before being interviewed by immigration officials. “Crossing the Channel in a small boat is incredibly dangerous. Anyone attempting the journey is taking a huge risk with their life and the lives of their loved ones.” In September, a record 86 migrants crossed the English Channel in a single day."
2019-10-04T18:37:06Z,Greek PM: EU states must do more to share burden of hosting refugees,"The Greek prime minister has called for sanctions to be imposed on EU member states that refuse to share the burden of hosting refugees, as the country struggles to handle burgeoning numbers of asylum seekers. Amid mounting tensions over the dramatic increase in men, women and children crossing from Turkey, Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned that his centre-right government would take a tougher line than its leftist predecessor, stepping up deportations and internationalising the issue. “I will say this clearly: I will raise the matter of specific sanctions for European countries that refuse to take part in a fair distribution of refugees on a European level,” he said on Friday, as senior EU officials visited Athens and Ankara for talks on the migration crisis. The influx has overwhelmed Aegean island camps and put the new government on the defensive, barely three months after it was voted into office. This week riots erupted in Moria, the vastly overcrowded registration centre on Lesbos, after an Afghan woman died in a fire at the facility, prompting demands for mass transferrals to the Greek mainland. The camp is now operating at four times over capacity with 13,500 living mostly in flimsy tents. In other islands across the Aegean archipelago, close to 30,000 are currently forced to endure conditions human rights groups have described as deplorable. Mitsotakis pledged to move as many as 20,000 to the mainland, insisting “we don’t want fences or walls”, but he also claimed that most of those now entering Greece were economic migrants rather than refugees. “Today only two out of 10 are Syrians,” he told parliament, recalling that in 2015, at the height of Europe’s migration crisis, 75% of those landing on Greek shores had come from the war-torn nation. “Some 50% are Afghans and Pakistanis, who are moved by organised traffickers. Most have the profile of economic migrants, not refugees.” The sharp increase has alarmed Brussels and Berlin. Under a landmark accord struck with the EU in March 2016, Ankara agreed to curb flows by enhancing patrols along its Aegean coast. In return, Brussels promised to hand over $6bn in funds to the country. Amid bitter recriminations over the amount of money given thus far, Turkey’s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has threatened “to open the gates” and flood Europe with migrants if demands aren’t met. The Turkish leader is also pressing for European support in creating a “safe zone” in northern Syria where Ankara aims to resettle some 2 million Syrian refugees. As home to close to 4 million displaced Syrians, Turkey hosts more Syrians than any other place in the world. With concerns heightened over the pact’s durability, the European commission’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, and German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, held talks in Turkey and Greece on Friday as officials called for more deportations of asylum seekers whose applications are rejected. Mitsotakis reiterated his government’s plans to send back 10,000 migrants to Turkey by the end of 2020 – an eight-fold increase of the number readmitted under the former Syriza administration. But the returns – and plans to create closed, pre-deportation centres – are controversial. “We are very much opposed to this policy of deterrence,” Dimitris Vitsas, the former migration minister under the Syriza government, told the Guardian. “In every flow there is a mix of migrants and refugees. To say that only migrants are arriving now is very wrong when you are asking for others to equitably share the burden. Does this government honestly think that Hungary and other [central and European countries] will accept to take in more when it is openly saying they are not refugees?”"
2019-06-26T13:42:51Z,Far-right suspect confesses to killing German politician,"A far-right extremist has confessed to murdering a pro-refugee German politician who was found dead outside his house on 2 June having been shot in the head. Stephan Ernst, a 45-year-old German man with a string of convictions for violent anti-migrant crime, was arrested two weeks after the murder of Walter Lübcke, 65. Police had matched Ernst’s DNA with evidence recovered from the scene of the crime. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said on Wednesday that Ernst had confessed to what Seehofer called a “political murder” and that the hunt was still on for possible accomplices. Ernst reportedly said Lübcke’s pro-refugee stance was his motive. Lübcke, a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), was well known as a champion of refugees in Germany. He had previously received death threats due to his stance. Ernst admitted being incensed by Lübcke’s comments at a town hall meeting in October 2015, Spiegel Online reported. At the meeting, held to discuss a new asylum seeker shelter, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entered the country, Lübcke reportedly said: “One has to stand up for values here. And those who don’t do so can leave this country any time, if they don’t like it. That’s the freedom of every German.” It is not clear whether Ernst attended the meeting, but a video of Lübcke’s comments was reportedly circulated in far-right forums and was mentioned at rallies by the anti-immigration Pegida movement at the height of the migration crisis. Investigators believe Ernst had contact with the far-right NPD party, as well as the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, whose members are known for promoting violence, hoarding weapons and spreading far-right propaganda and bomb-making guides. He served a prison sentence after attempting to plant a pipe bomb outside a home for asylum seekers in 1993. He was arrested 10 years ago at a neo-Nazi march in Dortmund and sentenced to seven months’ probation for breaching the peace. Extremists and neo-Nazis have posted messages online appearing to applaud Lübcke’s murder, stoking fears that a wider networkcould have been involved in the killing. The killing has deeply shaken Germany and raised questions about whether the country has failed to take seriously a rising threat from neo-Nazis. Ernst has claimed he acted alone, but Seehofer said investigators would continue to hunt for possible accomplices or co-conspirators. “The investigation of this political murder is not yet complete,” Seehofer said. He promised to “do everything humanly possible to investigate this terrible act”, adding: “We will continue to work hard to establish whether there were accessories or even accomplices. We owe that to the public.”"
2019-11-01T07:00:25Z,Tamba: Senegal's migration starting point – photo essay,"People of Tamba, inspired by German photographer August Sander’s seminal work, People of the 20th Century, was conceived as a catalogue of the society of Tambacounda, the largest city in the most remote and rural region of Senegal, and the point of departure for the majority of Senegalese migration. Gagnesseri Seck, waitress Bassirou Ndao, music shop owner Samba Sow, tailor Simon Faye, grapefruit seller The series portrays various professionals – from doctors and bankers to teachers and farmers – in their work environments to highlight their roles and contribution to society. This dignified series of portraits aims to counter negative and number-based reporting about migration in western media by bringing individuals and their personal stories to the fore. Cheikh Faye, shoe seller Mouhamadou Camara, bicycle repairer Adamo Diallo, cotton farmer M.me Ngom, elementary school teacher M.me Ngom is one of two teachers at the elementary school in Sinthian, where about 120 children attend, and due to shortage of teachers she teaches two classes together at the same time. When Giovanni met her, Adama was picking cotton in a small family field together with her husband, her sister and two nephews. Le Korsa funded the installation of bore-wells outfitted with solar-powered pumps in each village, which provides year-round access to water and helps growing through the harsh dry season. Also featured as part of this project are architectural and landscape images of street installations of the portraits exhibited in key migration destinations in Africa and Europe, including Dakar, Marrakech, Berlin and Milan. In each location, large-scale photographs were printed and displayed across the city, where people could appreciate the pictures and see themselves reflected in their own society. The photographic project is accompanied by Senegal/Sicily, which is a series of short documentaries created with the Italian film-maker Alberto Amoretti. Both projects aim to explore different aspects of clandestine migration. Alpha/Aisadou The first documentary of the series is a dialogue between a mother, Aisadou, speaking from her village in the east part of Senegal, and her son Alpha in Sicily, who has left home to find a better future. Aisadou lives in Sinthian, a village in Tambacounda. This is where the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation built Thread, a community centre and artists’ residence. Aisadou and her son Alpha Alpha lives in Mazzarino, a small town in the centre of Sicily. Mother and son talk about their hopes and their regrets; Aisadou talks of her worries as a mother and Alpha about the hardships he has faced. The documentaries each feature the experiences, dreams and reflections of migrants and their relatives who remained in Senegal. These include the monologues of Aisadou and Alpha, discussions with migrant residents of San Berillo in Catania and interviews with families of migrants who died at sea. “After screening in Sinthian, we met a man who had begun to save money to start the trip. Now we don’t know what happened to him, but what it is important is that after seeing the film, he reconsidered,” Hänninen says. A screening in Tambacounda. The project wants to show to the young people of Tambacounda who are considering leaving a sincere account of the risks of the voyage and the reality of those who made it to Europe. Young Women of Le Foyer Le Foyer de Jeunes Filles in Tambacounda is a home for girls and young women who come to the city to attend secondary school. Coming from villages that only have primary schools, the girls find a safe place to live while they complete their education. If it was not for Le Foyer, they would have abandoned their studies and, most likely, remained in their villages and married underage. The girls at Le Foyer talk about their desire to get the training they need to help their country. They not only want to graduate, but also to become leaders of a new Senegal. Khadidiatou Nadya and Khady Camara, young women of Le Foyer Khadidiatou had to fight to get the permission from her father to finish her schooling to become a nurse. She helps the family with her small savings from her scholarship and her part-time job as tutor at the Foyer de Jeunes Filles. She is the only one in a family of 16 sons to be allowed to have access to secondary school. One of her brothers decided to leave illegally Senegal and reach Europe. At the time of the interview, he was kept in refugee camp in Sicily, waiting for papers. To help disseminate the message of the films, the Albers Foundation and Le Korsa have launched a series of film screenings and discussions throughout the Tambacounda region, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The screenings unite families, teachers and local leaders in dialogue about the experiences of migrants, and how the financial resources devoted to migration may be better used to improve life locally. One of the screenings in Dakar. The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le Korsa will display a selection of images and films from both projects at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair held in Paris, 9-11 November 2019."
2019-07-16T05:10:27Z,Australia's Orwellian anti-refugee system hints at what's to come for climate refugees | Jeff Sparrow,"If you want to imagine the politics of the future, think about climate refugees. This week the ABC published internal briefing notes from the Australian Defence Force warning about huge population flows spurred by environmental disasters, with the former defence force chief Chris Barrie telling the broadcaster he once estimated the number at 100 million people. Already, catastrophic weather forces some 24 million from their homes each year. We can expect more of that: more sudden floods and storms and other disasters of the kind that send people seeking shelter. But the slower, incremental effects will be worse. Even leading Morrison government ministers recognise the consequences of sea level rises. You’ll remember that, back in 2015, Peter Dutton failed to see a live mic when yukking it up with Morrison and Tony Abbott about the likely fate of Pacific Island nations. “Time doesn’t mean anything,” Dutton joked, “when you’re about to have water lapping at your door.” Meanwhile, arid countries also face an existential threat, from desertification and permanent drought. By 2050, the World Bank expects the displacement of perhaps 143 million people from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America. Those are, of course, some of the poorest regions in the world, places that benefited least from the Great Acceleration of consumer capitalism in the post-war era. The carbon-belching industries of the 21st century have not enriched the average person in Somalia – and yet the UNHRC now warns of climate change in that nation exacerbating the floods and droughts already sending millions into camps. “The oft noted scandal of climate change,” say Geoff Mann and Joel Wainwright in their book Climate Leviathan, “is that whose who caused it will not live to see its full consequences and those who are suffering or will suffer worst did not cause the problem.” Crucially, the Refugee Convention offers no succour at all to those displaced by climate. It defines a refugee as “any person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his/her nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country”. Climate refugees, in other words, don’t exist – at least, not from the perspective of the current legal apparatus. They might have done nothing wrong (few people have smaller carbon footprints than the inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa). They might be the victims of processes set in train by others. But that doesn’t matter. As international law now stands, they’re not entitled to anything. The urban theorist Mike Davis suggests that: “Instead of galvanising heroic innovation and international co-operation, growing environmental and socio-economic turbulence may simply drive elite publics into more frenzied attempts to wall themselves off from the rest of humanity. Global mitigation … would be tacitly abandoned – as, to some extent, it already has been – in favour of accelerated investment in selection adaption for Earth’s first-class passengers. The goal would be the creation of green and gated oases of permanent affluence on an otherwise stricken planet.” Australian refugee policy provides a pretty good inkling of what that might look like, with one of the richest countries in the world obsessively preoccupied with excluding desperate people seeking assistance. Note that authorities classify the vast proportion of those detained in Australia’s offshore facilities as “refugees”. They’ve passed all the assessments; they’ve jumped through all the hoops – they’re legally entitled to protection. Yet, according to the Refugee Council of Australia, the government spends more than $573, 000 on each of them, not to provide them with a new home but to keep them incarcerated. Indeed, a 2016 report by Unicef Australia and Save the Children put the total cost of boat turnbacks, offshore and onshore detention between 2013 and 2016 at a staggering $9.6bn. That’s the budget allocated to repel asylum seekers – even though, as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Australia is obliged to protect displaced people from refoulement. You can draw your own conclusions as to the likely treatment of those to whom Australia has no legal obligations at all. In the documents obtained by the ABC, the defence force says it “does not currently have an overarching strategy or policy to specifically address the risks posed by climate change beyond the 2016 Defence White Paper”. That might be true in the narrowest sense. Yet the anti-refugee infrastructure created over the last decades creates – merely by its existence – a default policy on climate. Unless there’s massive political change, the bipartisan commitment to excluding people fleeing the carnage created (at least in part) by western military adventures will provide the basis for excluding people fleeing the carnage created (at least in part) by western industrial pollution. As the novelist William Gibson once said, the future is already here – it’s just unevenly distributed. If we don’t do anything now, the response to climate change will exacerbate and extend existing inequities, with the burden heaped upon the poor and the weak. But the reverse also holds true. If we want to prevent the population flows spurred by climate culminating in dystopia of barbed wire and armed enforcers, we need to fight the Orwellian system already enforced on Manus Island and Nauru. Whatever justice we offer refugees today helps lay the foundation for justice in the much more challenging period to come. Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
2019-11-14T06:00:30Z,"Trump proposed sending migrants to Guantánamo, claims book by anonymous author","Donald Trump proposed designating all migrants entering the US without permission as “enemy combatants” and shipping them to Guantánamo Bay to be detained alongside hardened terrorism suspects, according to a new book written by an anonymous author described as “a senior official in the Trump administration”. Among the many incendiary details contained in A Warning, a behind-the-scenes account of the White House under Trump, is the revelation that the president floated the idea of changing the legal designation of migrants as a way of forcibly keeping them out of the country. The change would effectively have condemned all undocumented migrants to the same legal treatment as the al-Qaida architects of 9/11. The author of A Warning shot to public notice in September 2018, when he or she wrote an article in the New York Times. The column presented its author as part of an internal resistance to Trump, trying to frustrate his most extreme ambitions. In the new book, which the Guardian obtained in advance of publication next week, Anonymous puts flesh on the bones of some such harebrained schemes. The migrant plan, the author writes, stemmed from Trump’s unfounded conviction that unlawful migration across the border with Mexico was “the biggest crisis in American history”. When his proposed solution of labelling all undocumented migrants “enemy combatants” began to circulate around the administration, it provoked astonishment and mortification, the author writes. “Are you fucking kidding me? This is completely batshit,” an unnamed state department official is quoted as saying. Trump signed an executive order to keep Guantánamo Bay open as a prison camp in January 2018, reversing Barack Obama’s policy of closing it. Earlier this year it was reported that at the height of the detention crunch over unaccompanied minors crossing the southern border, Department of Homeland Security officials explored the possibility of sending some migrant children to Guantánamo. But A Warning suggests that Trump wanted to go much further, applying the “enemy combatant” label to all undocumented migrants as deterrence. The author says the wild idea was quickly and quietly opposed: “Before the president could make a public case for the concept, officials quashed it.” “Enemy combatants” was the legal definition the Bush administration seized upon as a way of skirting international law to justify indefinitely detaining al-Qaida and Taliban suspects picked up in the so-called “war on terror” after 9/11. Its use to bypass federal courts and hold terror suspects in the extrajudicial military setting of the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, was condemned around the world. Using the same designation for undocumented migrants would have taken the concept to another level entirely. As Anonymous points out, migrants are neither enemies nor combatants, as they are not engaged in hostilities against the US. The author calls the idea morally offensive and “truly insane, on its face, for America to send migrant children and families to a terrorist prison in Cuba”. Speculation, already rife, will continue over the author’s identity. He or she is constantly vague about attribution and takes care not to include details which could place them in any given meeting. Their learning is not worn lightly. Other than examining A Warning’s frequent lectures about the founding fathers, a search for White House employees with a passion for the classics may yet bear fruit. To widespread amusement, a dismissive New York Times review mentioned a quotation of the Roman orator Cicero. Anonymous also cites Marcus Aurelius and Plato and directly compares Trump to a fifth-century Greek, Cleon, a “prominent Athenian” who “inherited money from his father and leveraged it to launch a career in politics”. Cleon, Anonymous writes, pursued populist policies and “was a crass and blunt public speaker, an immoral man who frequently sued his opponents, an armchair critic of those in power, and an orator who preyed upon the emotions of the people to whip up public support for his opinions. “Although some accounts characterise him as charming, his speaking style was said to be angry and repugnant.” Aristophanes and Thucydides wrote about Cleon but Anonymous cites Aristotle, who he says “described Cleon as: ‘[T]he man who, with his attacks, corrupted the Athenians more than anyone else.’” The author does not support impeachment, the fate apparently awaiting Trump as public hearings continue. Nor does he or she think using the 25th amendment to remove the president has ever been a serious prospect, however titillating their version of White House chatter about it after the firing of James Comey. Instead, the epilogue of A Warning contains a call for the American people to take action at the polls next year, in the way passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 fought their hijackers on 9/11. In 2016, a widely read essay titled The Flight 93 Election posited that principled conservatives should back Trump because “a Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto. With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.” It was written under the name Publius Decius Mus. That was a nod to the founding fathers – Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers under the name Publius – but it also echoed modern-day conservatives such as Virgil, who propagates the Deep State conspiracy theory via the pages of Breitbart. The original Publius Decius Mus was a Roman consul who sacrificed himself in battle in 340BC. The conservative who took his name was revealed to be Michael Anton, who became a Trump adviser and spokesman for the national security adviser HR McMaster. McMaster, who some say sacrificed to Trump much of his reputation as a great general and military thinker, is portrayed sympathetically in A Warning. Anton, however, left the White House around the same time, some months before Anonymous wrote their infamous column for the New York Times."
2019-10-16T13:50:52Z,Italian coastguard finds bodies of migrants who drowned at sea,"Italian authorities have found the bodies of at least 12 people who drowned last week after a boat capsized in rough seas off the island of Lampedusa. Photos released by the Italian coastguard showed some of the clothed bodies floating at a depth of about 60 metres (200ft). Among them was a woman who drowned while embracing her child of about eight months. On Tuesday last week, Italian authorities rescued 22 survivors from the boat, which was carrying about 50 people. The bodies of 13 women were found at the time, including that of a 12-year-old girl. But after testimony from those who survived, it was clear dozens of people, including eight children, were missing. According to an initial reconstruction of events, all the people onboard moved to one end of the vessel as the rescue boat arrived, causing it to overturn. Survivors said the boat had initially left Libya carrying mostly people from sub-Saharan Africa, before sailing along the coast to reach the city of Sfax in Tunisia, where another 15 people boarded for the journey to Sicily. The site of the wreck was finally located on Tuesday and the bodies will be recovered in the next few days. The Agrigento prosecutor, Salvatore Vella, who is leading the investigation into the incident and the search operation, said: “We believed in it until the end. “The divers did not give up for a single day. They put all their heart into returning the bodies of loved ones to their relatives.” The news has shaken Italy, particularly because of the high number of children onboard. Prosecutors have released some of the harrowing accounts of survivors. Among those was that of a young Tunisian called Wissen. When the boat sank, the man recovered the body of a child who had been onboard. But suddenly, he recounted, another person desperately clung to his legs to try to save himself, risking dragging Wissen down with him. Wissen had to let go of the child to unfasten his trousers, and the other person drowned. Wissen was saved but could no longer find the child. Although the number of arrivals has practically halved, thousands of people continue to attempt the crossing from Libya to Europe. On Tuesday, the Italian coastguard assisted a boat with 180 people onboard, while Maltese authorities aided another boat carrying 75 people. On Wednesday, the Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking docked in Taranto with 176 people onboard. The vessel, operated by the charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières, had rescued them at sea about 30 miles (48km) off the Libyan coast. While EU member states are working on a temporary plan to quickly take people off boats in the Mediterranean and distribute them among countries willing to accommodate them, there has been significant criticism in Italy of a human trafficker participating in a meeting with authorities. Abd al-Rahman Milad, known as Bija – described by the UN as one of the world’s most notorious human traffickers – met Italian officials and a delegation from the Libyan coastguard at Cara di Mineo, one of the biggest migrant reception centres in Europe, in May 2017. In February of that year, the then Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, signed a memorandum with the leader of Libya’s UN-recognised government, Fayez al-Sarraj, introducing a new level of cooperation between the Libyan coastguard and Italy, including the provision of four patrol vessels. Despite Italian authorities denying their involvement in the meeting, the UN migration agency has confirmed it was requested by the interior ministry. Bija was reached by the Italian newspaper Avvenire, which first reported the case. In the interview, the trafficker said he was “offended by how the media have described him” and that he was “coming to that meeting only to discuss how to block the flow of migrants”."
2019-09-10T15:04:28Z,‘Life-saving’: hundreds of refugees to be evacuated from Libya to Rwanda,"Hundreds of African refugees and asylum seekers trapped in Libyan detention centres will be evacuated to Rwanda under a “life-saving” agreement reached with Kigali and the African Union, the UN refugee agency said on Tuesday. The first group of 500 people, including children and young people from Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan, are expected to arrive in Rwanda over the coming days, out of 4,700 now estimated to be in custody in Libya, where conflict is raging. The measure is part of an “emergency transit mechanism”, to evacuate people at risk of harm in detention centres inside the county. Babar Baloch, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, said the agreement was “a life-line” mechanism to allow those in danger to get to a place of safety. “This is an expansion of the humanitarian evacuation to save lives,” said Baloch. “The focus is on those trapped inside Libya. We’ve seen how horrible the conditions are and we want to get them out of harm’s way.” More than 50,000 people fleeing war and poverty in Africa remain in Libya, where a network of militias run overcrowded detention centres, and where there are reports that people have been sold as slaves or into prostitution. The UN denied reports the European Union were behind the agreement, as part of a strategy to keep migrants away from Europe. Vincent Cochetel, the special envoy for the UNHCR for the central Mediterranean, told Reuters the funding would mainly come from the EU, but also from the African Union which has received $20m (£16m) from Qatar to support the reintegration of African migrants. But he later said on Twitter that no funding had yet been received and that he was working on it “with partners”. Baloch said: “We are asking for support from all of our donors, including the EU. The arrangement is between UNHCR, the African Union and Rwanda.” The EU has been criticised for funding the Libyan coastguard, who pick up escaped migrants from boats in the Mediterranean and send them back to centres where they face beatings, sexual violence and forced labour according to rights groups. In July, the bombing of a migrant detention centre in Tripoli left 44 people dead, leading to international pressure to find a safe haven for refugees. Under the agreement, the government of Rwanda will receive and provide protection to refugees and asylum seekers in groups of about 50, who will be put up in a transit facility outside the capital of Kigali. After their arrival, the UNHCR will continue to pursue solutions for them. Some will be resettled to third countries, others helped to return to countries where asylum had previously been granted and others will stay in Rwanda. They will return to their homes if it is safe to do so. Cochetel said: “The government has said, ‘If you [UNHCR] think the people should stay long-term in Rwanda, no problem. If you think they should be reunited with their family, they should be resettled, no problem. You [UNHCR] decide on the solution.’” “Rwanda has said, ‘We’ll give them the space, we’ll give them the status, we’ll give them the residence permit. They will be legally residing in Rwanda as refugees.’” Rwanda, a country of 12 million, is the second African country to provide temporary refuge to migrants in Libya. It already supports around 150,000 refugees from neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. UNHCR has evacuated more than 2,900 refugees and asylum seekers out of Libya to Niger through an existing emergency transit mechanism. Almost 2,000 of them have been resettled, to countries in Europe, the US and Canada, the agency said, with the rest remaining in Niger."
2019-10-22T23:01:18Z,Refugee age rows having 'devastating impact' on children,"Age disputes are having a “devastating impact” on unaccompanied and separated refugee or asylum seeker children arriving in the UK, the UN refugee agency has warned. Evidence from an assessment conducted by the UNHCR found disputes over a refugee or asylum seeker’s age impeded and delayed access to services and environments that can assist integration. Children whose ages are in dispute are liable to be placed in inappropriate accommodation together with adults, posing a risk to their safety, the report said, and are likely to be denied access to education. The mental and physical health of such children may deteriorate, they are at increased risk of absconding or being trafficked, and of being detained as an adult in an immigration removal centre, the report said. “For many children, these initial mistakes take at least months, and often years, to correct,” the report said. “In the meantime, children are exposed to harmful and protracted disputes, not only denied the support to which they are legally entitled, but also forced to challenge the very people charged to look after them.” The assessment identified numerous cases where asylum seekers, initially judged to be adults, were later determined to be children as young as 15. International best practice specifies that age assessment procedures should only be undertaken as a measure of last resort, when there are grounds for serious doubt about the person’s age and once informed consent has been obtained. Prior to the assessment, all age-disputed individuals should be given the benefit of the doubt and treated as a child unless this would be clearly unreasonable. But the UNHCR report said significant changes in UK policy and practice were required to bring age-assessment processes in line with these principles. The report was one of three commissioned by the European commission and published by the UNHCR on Wednesday. They make the case for taking steps to ensure unaccompanied or separated child refugees and asylum seekers arriving in the UK can more quickly recover from trauma. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it. We take our responsibilities towards unaccompanied children extremely seriously and, in the past 12 months, we gave protection to more than 7,000 children. “Our approach to age-disputed cases strikes the sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are supported while maintaining the integrity of the asylum system. “When there is doubt about whether someone is an adult or a child, they will be referred to a local authority’s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.”"
2019-11-10T10:02:24Z,Vox party puts ‘menace’ of migrant children at centre of election drive,"Santiago Abascal’s least favourite neighbours sit – young and bored – on benches outside their temporary home, their coats zipped up against the cold of a Madrid November. On the other side of the fence, beneath the plane trees, the people of Hortaleza go about their business, pushing buggies, walking dogs and casting the occasional glance at the reception centre for menas, or unaccompanied foreign minors. If the centre has long been infamous locally, it acquired national notoriety last week when Abascal, leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, singled it out in a TV debate before Sunday’s general election. “I live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood – Hortaleza,” he said. “And every time I’m on the street – and there’s a menas centre there – I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.” Neither Vox’s messaging nor its targets have been hard to make out in the last days of the campaign. In Monday’s debate, Abascal falsely suggested that 70% of gang rapes in Spain were committed by foreigners. Earlier the same day, Rocío Monasterio, Vox’s leader in Madrid, descended on the gates of another centre for unaccompanied minors, in Seville, arguing that menas made the streets unsafe and posed “a serious problem in our neighbourhoods”. Monasterio’s husband, Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a Vox spokesman, joined in the following day, claiming that foreigners were three times more likely to commit rape than Spaniards. If polls are to be believed, the party’s strategy – less dog whistle and more canine klaxon – seems to be paying off. Vox’s defence of what it sees as traditional Spanish values, bolstered by its uncompromising stance on Catalan independence, puts it in a position to finish third in Spain’s fourth general election in as many years. Not bad for a party that won its first seats in congress less than seven months ago. Even more notable has been its effect on its rightwing rivals, the conservative People’s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party. Both shifted further right before April’s election, hoping to compete with Vox, and both have enlisted the support of Abascal’s grouping to win power in Andalucía and Madrid. The new triple-right – unaffectionately known by some as the trifachito (facha being slang for fascist) – has filled the political space that used to be the sole territory of the PP. A recent cover of the satirical magazine El Jueves showed Vox, the PP and Citizens emerging from General Franco’s grave in the Valley of the Fallen, with the PP leader Pablo Casado crying: “Ha ha! We are the true remains of Franco!” Abascal appeared to acknowledge the party’s inspiration during the debate, when he paraphrased the fascist philosopher Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, saying: “Only the rich can permit themselves the luxury of not having a homeland.” The party went on to address the question of homelands within Spain on Thursday. In a symbolic proposal backed by Citizens and the PP in Madrid’s regional parliament, Vox called for a ban “of separatist parties that threaten the unity of Spain”. Vox also has a blacklist of media outlets it views as critical and bans them from its offices and events. They include the newspaper El País, radio network Cadena Ser and the online newspaper Eldiario.es. The acting prime minister and socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, was not slow to acknowledge the parallels with the past. “Fixing on homosexuals, blaming women for gender-based violence, suggesting a ban on political parties – all that has a name that doesn’t need to be spelt out,” he said. Like most rightwing populist parties, Vox delights in provoking outrage by spewing provocative messages regardless of their veracity. But for many, the attacks on unaccompanied migrant children are repellent at best and dangerous at worst. Emilio Delgado, a member of the Madrid regional parliament for the leftwing Más Madrid party, points out that the Hortaleza centre is desperately overcrowded and under-resourced. “The kids there are fighting over who gets a mattress so they don’t have to sleep on the floor,” he said. “That’s happening in a public facility run by the richest regional government in Spain. There are 70 or 80 or 100 kids there when there should only be 30 or 40. That obviously brews conflict between the kids themselves and for staff and neighbours.” The centre’s residents have also been attacked twice in a fortnight by people armed with oars and clubs. Delgado acknowledges that some of the young people cause problems in the neighbourhood but said he was disgusted by Abascal’s words. “I get along fine with politicians with whom I disagree on a lot of things, but it’s really hard to do that with Vox when they’re painting targets on the chests of very vulnerable boys and girls,” he said. “They’re crossing all the red lines, and the PP and Citizens are along for the ride.” José Miguel Aragón, who has been working with homeless young people in Hortaleza for 30 years as part of the Olivar association, also admits there is a problem. Four years ago, his mother had a necklace torn from her throat in the area. But he argues that the current thefts and robberies are nothing compared with the “heroin years” of the 1970s and 1980s when drug disputes in Hortaleza were settled with knives and pistols. “This is a problem that’s been going on for quite a few years,” he said. With the centre overwhelmed, some young people had taken to sleeping on the streets to avoid the conflicts and overcrowding, while others escaped by sniffing glue. “It’s a lack of care: lots of these kids are cold and hungry and have been on the streets for hours.” After the economic crisis, and with the rise of Vox, Aragón said, old xenophobic narratives had begun to resurface. And some agendas, he added, were better served by demonising people and focusing on problems rather than accepting responsibility.“There are people in this neighbourhood who are helping, by giving boxing lessons and organising football matches,” he said. “There are people doing all that but other people are interested in telling a different story. “What we’re talking about here is adolescent kids who are bored, alone and have no future. That normally means things are going to happen. It would be odd if they didn’t.”"

Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Trump deserts Kurdish allies: ‘They didn’t help us in Normandy’ Turkish troops began in earnest their offensive in north-eastern Syria on Wednesday as Donald Trump made plain the US would abandon its Kurdish allies in the region, justifying his controversial decision by arguing that the Kurds “didn’t help us in the second world war, they didn’t help us with Normandy”. Despite a looming humanitarian catastrophe, resigned civilians fled remarkably calmly from the border town of Ras al-Ayn as the Turkish military claimed to have hit 181 “militant targets”. Detention centre. Women and children at the Kurdish-controlled al-Hawl camp, home to 60,000 people with links to Isis, expect to be freed amid the Turkish assault, claiming Isis sleeper cells will attack their Kurdish guards in the coming days. Isis Britons. Two British Isis members being held in north-eastern Syria, accused of involvement in the beheading of western hostages, have been transferred from Kurdish to US custody. German gunman livestreamed shooting at synagogue The suspected perpetrator of an antisemitic shooting at a synagogue in the German city of Halle livestreamed his attack on Twitch. Two people died and two others were severely injured in the attempted mass shooting, as the gunman, wearing a military-style uniform, tried to force his way into the synagogue during a Yom Kippur celebration on Wednesday. He recorded the attacks on a head-mounted camera and uploaded some 35 minutes of footage online, accompanied by an antisemitic and rightwing extremist rant. Homemade weapons. The footage shows the suspect becoming increasingly frustrated and calling himself a “loser” as his homemade weapons repeatedly malfunctioned, likely preventing a much higher death toll. Suspect named. German media have identified the killer as Stephan Balliet, a 27-year-old German citizen from the town of Eisleben in Saxony-Anhalt. Biden and Pelosi hit back at Trump in impeachment fight Joe Biden has for the first time called for Trump to be impeached over his abuse of presidential power to smear the Democratic frontrunner and secure his own re-election. Speaking at a campaign event on Wednesday, Biden said Trump was “shooting holes in the constitution”, claiming the president had “picked a fight with the wrong guy”. Meanwhile, the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, insisted White House attempts to stymie the impeachment inquiry would prove futile, warning Trump: “You are not above the law.” ‘Leaker’ charged. Henry Kyle Frese, a counter-terrorism analyst with the US Defense Intelligence Agency, has been charged with leaking classified materials to journalists, including one with whom he was romantically involved. Diplomatic immunity. The US diplomat’s wife who fled the UK following a road accident in which a 19-year-old motorcyclist was killed will not return to Britain for trial, according to briefing notes seen in Trump’s hand at a Wednesday press conference. US sends migrants to Mexican border towns despite violence The US has returned more than 51,000 asylum seekers to Mexico to await the outcome of their cases under the Trump administration’s new “Remain in Mexico” program, despite advising its own citizens to avoid Mexican border towns due to an increased threat of violent crime. A report by the group Human Rights First has found at least 340 instances of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacks against people sent back to Mexico under the so-called Migration Protection Protocols. ‘Torn Apart’.

2019-08-18T08:00:11Z,The Unsettling of Europe by Peter Gatrell review – the messy truth about migration,"When I first worked on migration issues in the Cabinet Office at the turn of the millennium, a letter crossed my desk from the then leader of Kent county council, complaining about the number of asylum seekers, and mentioning that Kent had “no prior history of multicultural diversity”. In fact, Dover was represented in parliament by Thomas Papillon, a Huguenot refugee, in the 17th century. This historical amnesia seems all-pervasive when it comes to political debate in the UK. How many times have we heard politicians or the press complain that “we can’t talk about immigration”, when it has been a controversial political issue for more than a century, from the Aliens Act 1905 to Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech to the Brexit referendum? It is that amnesia – the idea that, unlike the US, Europe is not a continent of immigration, and so any new flows of people are a temporary, and generally unwelcome, phenomenon – that Peter Gatrell sets out to confront in his timely and ambitious new book, The Unsettling of Europe. Immigration, if not ignored entirely, is often compartmentalised in most histories of Europe or its constituent countries. Gatrell frames it as central to the continent’s postwar development, both economic and social, beginning with the huge forced relocations and refugee flows that followed the second world war, running through the postcolonial labour migrations that fuelled Europe’s economic renaissance, to the wars and crises in “peripheral Europe” and Europe’s “near abroad” that have been in the spotlight in recent years. Perhaps the most striking chapter – because it’s least familiar – is the one that deals with the first of these, which Gatrell describes as “violent peacetime”, with 17 million people on the move. The horror of the Red Army’s occupation of Germany is well known, even if the vast numbers never fail to shock, but other countries seized the opportunity, too. Churchill spoke of the need for a “clean sweep” of Germans in Poland. Communists (Gomułka in Poland) and democrats (Beneš in Czechoslovakia) agreed on the need to “liquidate the German problem”. Gatrell makes a strong, if largely implicit, case that this ethnic cleansing in a drive to create homogeneous states is the original sin that underlies the virulent nationalist populism now afflicting much of central and Eastern Europe. The story of labour migration to the former imperial powers, including the UK, as well as of Turks to Germany, is much better known. But Gatrell also highlights other episodes, where decolonisation and its accompanying upheavals led to refugees moving to or “returning” to the mother country – Moluccans who came to the Netherlands, the harkis and pieds-noirs who fled Algeria after independence. Not least, the East African Asians, whose presence in Africa was the direct result of the complex economic relations between the different constituent parts of the British empire, a fact many British politicians would rather have forgotten. And while other accounts often suggest that European countries acquired large non-white populations by accident, as a byproduct of labour migration that was always intended to be temporary, he notes that, long before Powell’s speech, politicians worried about the threat immigration posed to ethnic and religious homogeneity. Churchill wanted to fight the 1955 election with the slogan “Keep England White”, while De Gaulle famously worried that his home village would have to be renamed “Colombey-les-deux-Mosquées”. One strength of the book is its focus on the stories of individual migrants, the communities in which they arrived, and their continued connections, at least in some cases, with their countries of origin. From an ethnic German who moved from Kazakhstan to Hamburg, to an Iranian anthropologist now living in Sweden, we get at least a glimpse of the complexity of the topic. Gatrell’s nuanced and sympathetic treatment of the variety of the immigrant experience – and its impact on European societies – can also be seen as a rejoinder to two recent, well-publicised books. As HL Mencken wrote: “for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong.” Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death of Europe, an extended mixture of conspiracy theory and bigotry, wants some version of Trump’s ban on Muslim immigration. Eric Kaufmann’s Whiteshift argues for ethnic – that is, white – preference in immigration policies to preserve a supposedly threatened “white identity”. Gatrell, however, offers no such simplicities. He recognises – as the title makes clear – that migration can be unsettling, both for migrants and the societies where they arrive. Walls and fences – real and metaphorical – can avert this, at least in part, but there are costs. Without postwar migration, “the continent as a whole would have been much impoverished – less unsettled, perhaps, but greatly diminished”. He does not conceal his disappointment with the short-sighted and inhumane response of most European countries to the migrant crisis of 2015: “the default position was deterrence, detention and deportation”. But what should that mean for the future? There are no easy answers, and The Unsettling of Europe certainly does not offer any. Here in the UK, however, there are some grounds for optimism. The political upheavals sparked by Brexit – itself caused in large part by public attitudes to immigration – offer a window of opportunity to reset not just immigration policy but our broader perspective. This will take a degree of courage and initiative, not just from politicians, but from the rest of us. As Gatrell shows us, it will be contested, messy and imperfect, just as in every previous historical episode; but, as he also demonstrates, it can also enrich us.

2019-07-03T17:30:31Z,Why attack on Libya detention centre was grimly predictable,"Shocking as the precise circumstances are behind the deaths of at least 44 people in an airstrike that hit a detention centre in Tajoura in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, it is a predictable incident. Even as footage circulated online claiming to show blood and body parts mixed with rubble and migrants’ belongings from the air raid blamed on the forces of the warlord Khalifa Haftar, it emerged the detainees had been housed in a hangar next to a weapons store – the likely target of the strike. EU officials have long been aware of the risks in Libya, where migrants have faced atrocious mistreatment at the hands of militias, while Europe’s governments have prevented the sailing of migrant boats to Italy and elsewhere. Critics point to the EU’s decision to withdraw the naval assets involved in Operation Sophia, which provided a vital role in saving lives at sea, saying this has led to thousands more people being detained or trapped in facilities such as the one in Tajoura. In recent months, since Haftar and his self-styled National Liberation Forces launched their assault on the UN-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj in Tripoli, alarm bells over the safety of migrants had only grown louder. About 3,000 are housed in locations close to the fighting where migrants have already been killed. In the case of the Tajoura facility, the UN’s refugee agency, the UNHCR, noted it had warned less than two months ago that anyone inside the detention centre was at risk of being caught in the fighting around Tripoli. Amnesty had also warned of the risk of detaining migrants close to a military site after an airstrike hit a military vehicle about 100 metres from the detention centre on 7 May. Last month, it was the turn of the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights, whose spokesman, Rupert Colville, outlined a litany of abuses and dangers facing migrants detained in Libya, often after being intercepted by the EU-supported Libyan coastguard. Among the abuses Colville listed were reports of detainees dying untreated from tuberculosis in “ghastly conditions”, including 22 people in the Zintan facility south of Tripoli since September. Some, Colville said, appeared to have been sent deliberately to facilities close to the frontline, while others still had simply disappeared amid suspicions they had been trafficked after their detention into forced labour, for sexual exploitation or passed on again to smugglers offering transit to Europe. As the New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch made clear in a scathing report published in January titled No Escape from Hell, none of this should come as much of a surprise to officials. Two years ago, the EU’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, was compelled to acknowledge the shocking state of the detention centres in Libya and the widespread abuses, even as the bloc continued to support the anti-migration efforts at sea of Libyan authorities. “We are all conscious of the appalling and degrading conditions in which some migrants are held in Libya,” said Avramopoulos, conditions that have barely improved while the risks to those held in them have mounted. In July 2018, when Human Rights Watch researchers visited four detention centres in Tripoli, Misrata and Zuwara, they documented what they described as “inhumane conditions that included severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, poor quality food and water”, as well as “disturbing accounts of violence by guards, including beatings, whippings and use of electric shocks”. Commenting in the aftermath of the airstrike, Elinor Raikes of the International Rescue Committee called for detention centres to be evacuated. “This devastating development is a testament to the immense vulnerability of the refugees and migrants who remain trapped inside detention centres across Libya,” she said. “The fear and horror felt by those trapped in Tajoura and across Libya is unimaginable. People caught in detention centres must be evacuated to a place of safety outside Libya and search and rescue operations at sea immediately restored to protect those fleeing the violence. “A ceasefire is urgently needed. European governments and the US must recognise their role in bringing the warring parties back to the negotiating table.”"
2019-12-18T05:00:09Z,Syrian refugees return to home towns in 'safe zone' despite dangers,"Ibrahim Hamad has just returned home to Syria from Turkey for the first time in five years and feels lucky that his family’s house has survived heavy fighting in the area. Much has changed in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad. Hamad’s hometown has been fought over by the Syrian opposition, Islamic State, US-backed Kurdish forces and, now, Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxy fighters. “I decided to return since my house wasn’t destroyed and there’s still furniture left that wasn’t stolen,” the 35-year-old said. “I am trying to find a job now. I’ve heard that the schools are going to open soon. I hope so, because both my children are in elementary school and I want them to pursue their education.” Hamad and his family fled the fighting in Syria in 2014, and have returned from Sanliurfa in Turkey voluntarily. But human rights monitors believe that those moving back of their own accord are in the minority – and that the so-called safe zone carved out by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s October invasion of the border strip is anything but. On Tuesday, Erdoğan told the Global Refugee Forum in Geneva that 371,000 Syrians had already chosen to leave Turkey to move into the 32km-deep strip between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad, and that he expected another 600,000 to follow imminently, reflecting a pattern established by previous Turkish offensives in Afrin and Jarablus. The figure was disputed by Sara Kayyali, a Syria researcher with Human Rights Watch. “There are many obstacles to return for Syrians, and the ethnic angle here makes it even more difficult to verify whether these numbers are accurate,” she said. “Based on what we’ve seen so far, some people are being allowed to travel freely and others are not. That’s on top of violations such as looting and arbitrary arrests, the repeat of thuggish behaviours we saw in Afrin.” Ankara’s heavily criticised border operation was designed to clear the area of previously US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters that Turkey says are linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). But the offensive has a secondary, equally important goal: under intense domestic pressure to solve Turkey’s refugee crisis, Ankara has said up to 2 million of the country’s 3.6 million Syrian refugees will be repatriated to the safe zone. The bulk would be Arab Syrians originally from Aleppo, Deir Ezzor and other areas where the Syrian regime has regained control, leaving people afraid to return to their homes. The proposed influx of newcomers into the relatively small 2,000-sq-mile area now under Turkish control has been met with allegations of demographic engineering and ethic cleansing from rights groups and local Kurds, who say Turkey’s Syrian proxy fighters have forced Kurdish families from their homes and accuse them of looting, burning and confiscating farmland and businesses. Despite ceasefire deals brokered by the US and Russia, intermittent fighting in the form of shoot-outs, shelling and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) blamed on both sides continues. The UN said an additional 75,000 people inside Syria who fled the border fighting remain displaced from their homes, although 117,000 have managed to return to areas now under Turkish control. The latest upheaval leaves many Syrian families facing new dilemmas. “My family are split on this issue,” said Fatima, a Syrian originally from the contested town of Manbij now living in the Turkish city of Gaziantep. Erdoğan’s promise of $26bn for schools and hospitals in the area was unlikely to materalise, she said. “My father would love to go back home, our town and our house mean a lot to him. But based on previous repatriation efforts to places like Jarablus I just don’t believe we could be safe there. I don’t want my children growing up in an environment like that. These people are mercenaries, not the Free Syrian Army [opposition umbrella] we used to know. I don’t want these factions pressuring them to fight when they’re old enough.” Turkey’s latest repatriation efforts are also dogged by allegations it began a large campaign to forcibly deport Syrians over the summer in a violation of both domestic and international law regarding refugee protection. Amnesty International said that between July to September this year hundreds of refugees were compelled to return home, some in handcuffs, after receiving threats of violence or being tricked into signing “voluntary return” agreements. Others were told they were signing a registration document, a confirmation of having received a blanket from a detention centre, or a form that expressed their desire to remain in Turkey. Many Syrians living in Turkey without up-to-date paperwork fear that if they are caught up in another police crackdown they too could be forced home against their will. “Even if we went back, Turkish-controlled Syria is just as expensive as Turkey now and you’d still make Syrian wages,” said Milad, who lives in Gaziantep. “A Turkish residency card is worth its weight in gold now. It’s all those people here illegally or still living in camps who are the most vulnerable ones. They have no one to turn to if Turkey decides to kick them out.” Additional reporting by Hussein Akkosh"
2019-11-05T07:15:49Z,Teacher who helps migrant children turn pain into prize poetry,"Kate Clanchy, tall, fast-talking and slightly intimidating, lays out more than a score of slim books on the kitchen table in her Oxford home. They are collections of poetry written by children she taught, published with the help of grants that she tirelessly raised. One, in Arabic, with an English translation, is from a 13-year-old Syrian refugee, a boy with “messy handwriting and limited vocabulary” (but “a genius” all the same), according to the preface. Another has poems written in English by an 18-year-old Afghan girl who moved to the UK just four years ago. Others are by Somali, Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Polish children. A larger anthology, England: Poems From a School, edited by Clanchy and written by children at Oxford Spires academy, a multi-cultural comprehensive where she taught English and creative writing for 10 years until this summer, was published by Picador last year. Though the poems are sometimes about how migrant children see their new country, the most striking concern fragile memories of their homelands – “the sweet honey mangoes they tell me I used to love”, as a Bengali girl writes. Clanchy, 54, is a successful poet in her own right. Although she didn’t write poetry until her mid-20s, her first collection, Slattern, published when she was 30, won several prizes. She has also won prizes for radio plays and short stories. She once said “I don’t want to write novels; I don’t even like novels”, but published one in 2013 (“it started as a short story that had a very long back story”, she explains) and won a Costa Book award. She also won prizes for Antigona and Me, an account of her relationship with her cleaner, a Kosovan refugee. Now she has written a memoir, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, published to rave reviews this year. It is as vivid and honest an account of classroom teaching – in a depressed Scottish mining town, in suburban Essex, in Oxford – as you are likely to read. It is a series of sometimes moving, sometimes comic and always engaging stories, some about herself, but mostly about children. Like Callum, the smallest boy in his Scottish class, who, after learning about homosexuality and heterosexuality, announces that, when he grows up, “I’m no’ going to have either of them … Ah’ll just have a big dog”. Or Allen, an Essex boy with “hands the size of dinner plates” studying science A-levels, who was so “physically affected by poetry” that “an image made him flush to his eyebrows”. To his peers’ horror, he recited William Blake’s The Tyger in the local nightclub. Or Shakila from Afghanistan, who remembers how she saw a man wearing too many clothes on a hot day in the market and how she ran away because “I had this feeling, he is wrong”. He exploded a bomb, and a head (perhaps his) appeared on the street. After much struggle, she composes a poem about this experience. At Oxford Spires – which isn’t anywhere near the celebrated “dreaming spires” – it hits Clanchy with the force of revelation that migrant children’s dislocated lives and often horrific memories are not “disadvantages” to “compensate” for. On the contrary, having to pick up a new language gives them “extra sound awareness” and “the shock of dislocation … makes them listen to their inner voice”. And so they did, winning prizes for poetry: Oxford Spires nurtures young poets as Eton nurtures classicists. Clanchy has experience of not belonging, though nothing, she accepts, comparable to what refugee children undergo. She was born in Glasgow and, after her family moved to Edinburgh, went to the city’s George Watson’s College, a fee-charging school. She didn’t fit in, partly because the school was obsessed with sport and she was gawky, bookish and unsporty, partly because she had an English father and, as her peers heard it, an English voice. She went on to read English at Oxford University despite, she claims, being an undiagnosed dyslexic who still can’t spell. There, she felt decidedly Scottish and was amazed by the sense of “entitlement” among London barristers’ sons and cabinet ministers’ daughters. That was why she kept entering her pupils for prizes. “I wanted a bit of entitlement for them and to bring it back to the school.” But Clanchy, despite the school’s support, could help children write poetry only as an add-on to the mainstream curriculum. “You can’t be rewarded at any time in our exam system for writing a poem,” she says. English teaching, she argues, is being strangled by the demands for data on children’s progress. “It’s quite easy to mark creative writing, but you can’t easily explain why you’ve done it. You take a delicate, complex creation and then you have to find reductive phrases to describe it. And this idea that different forms of writing require different skills is wrong. I can teach people all they need to know about writing a business letter by writing poetry with them. You need to write well. That’s all there is to it.” In Some Kids, Clanchy intersperses her tales with the occasional rant (she prefers “riff”). She is particularly opinionated on church schools and, while choosing a comprehensive for the eldest of her three sons, visited a Catholic one where she questioned the chaplain about whether he would tell a gay pupil that homosexuality is a mortal sin. He would, he said, but “you don’t have to choose to send your child here”. She didn’t but, she writes, she has no choice about paying, through taxation, for other children to be taught there. She sent her son instead to Oxford Spires where she was already teaching – “it only had poor children”. Middle-class parents avoided it but “I invested my child in it”, she says. “He went with his best friend, also from a middle-class family, and I couldn’t have done it without them. He was very bright, quite swotty, quite shy, played the French horn and the piano. There was a time when I couldn’t go out of the house without somebody asking if he was all right, as though he’d gone green or something. He visibly flourished – he didn’t just get by, he felt he was loved there – and now he’s at St John’s College, Oxford.” The school was so diverse, she explains, that “middle-class white” was just another odd minority. Others followed and the school is now heavily oversubscribed. Choosing a school, Clanchy says, “is the most political choice we will ever make, far beyond voting”. You could also say that teaching is the most political profession you could enter. In Some Kids, she asks a hijab-wearing Bengali girl and her cousin why they write only about white people and not people like themselves. “Miss,” the girl replies. “We are not in books.” Thanks to Clanchy, they are now. Poems by Oxford Spires’ pupils A Glass of Tea (after Rumi) by Shukria Rezaei, then aged 15 Last year, I held a glass of tea to the light. This year, I swirl like a tea leaf in the streets of Oxford. Last year, I stared into navy blue sky. This year, I am roaming under colourless clouds. Last year, I watched the dazzling sun dance gracefully. This year, The faint sun moves futurelessly. Migration drove me down this bumpy road, Where I fell and smelt the soil, where I arose and sensed the cloud. Now I am a bird, flying in the breeze, Lost over the alien earth. Don’t stop and ask me questions. Look into my eyes and feel my heart. It is bruised, aching and sore. My eyes are veiled with onion skin. I sit helplessly in an injured nest, Not knowing how to fix it. And my heart, I’d say Is displaced Struggling to find its place. The Doves of Damascus by Ftoun Abou Kerech, then aged 14 I lost my country and everything I, had before. and now I cannot remember for sure the soft snow in my country I cannot remember the feel of damp air in summer. Sometimes I think I remember the smell of jasmine as I walked down the street. And sometimes autumn with its orange and scarlet leaves flying in the high Damascus sky And I am sure I remember my grandmother’s roof-garden, its vines, its sweet red grapes, the mint she grew in crates for tea. I remember the birds, the doves of Damascus. I remember how they scattered. I remember trying to catch them."
2019-12-28T19:00:16Z,From Nauru to limbo: the anguish of Australia's last asylum seeker in Cambodia,"Mohammad Roshid is hardly alone among refugees sent to Nauru and Manus Island by Australia when he says he feels “hopeless and broken” and that he is “stuck in limbo without a future in sight”. But Roshid’s despair is unique, thanks to his decision in 2015 to take up the offer of a transfer to Cambodia, one of only 10 asylum seekers held offshore to do so. The other nine have since managed to leave the country. Only Roshid remains, trapped in a poor country with no possibility of becoming a citizen and no support from the country that promoted his move – Australia. “All I am asking for is a permanent solution so I don’t have to live this stateless life,” the 29-year-old Rohingya says. “If I was given an opportunity to be resettled in a third country, I would be able to work and make a future without struggling on a daily basis. I can’t see this is a possibility if I remain in Cambodia.” A ‘solution’ with few takers Before the US deal and the New Zealand offer and the Canadian sponsorships, there was the Cambodian solution. It launched in 2014 when Scott Morrison, then immigration minister, clinked champagne glasses with Cambodia’s interior minister and signed a deal to send Australia’s offshore refugees to the south-east Asian country. The deal was widely criticised over its lack of transparency and the implications of Australia paying to ship its refugees to a country with a track record of human rights abuses and corruption, and which struggles to support its own people. It ended up costing Australia more than $50m to send 10 people, nine of whom eventually left the country. Cambodia, having received its $40m in aid, said it didn’t want any more. Roshid, who fled danger in his homeland and sought safety in Australia, only to be dumped on Nauru, now feels abandoned in Cambodia. For most of his life, he has sought to be a citizen of whatever country would have him. He took a chance on Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, based on promises he would no longer be stateless. But now he says he has heard nothing from the organisations that were tasked by the Australian government to support him, and watches from afar as his former fellow detainees finally get their second chance in North America. “I felt hopeless and broken when I saw that refugees from Manus and Nauru were being resettled in the US and Canada because I couldn’t see a future for me in Cambodia,” Roshid says. Despite assurances he says he received, neither the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) nor its successor, the Australian firm Connect Settlement Services, helped him get citizenship or a passport in his new home. Without it, he says, he cannot find work, buy a SIM card or rent an apartment. “I have been trying so hard to get a job but I haven’t had any luck yet,” he says. “I saw an advertisement on Facebook in October this year about a clothing factory. I called them and set up an appointment to see if I could work there. They asked me to bring my passport or citizenship card, which I was unable to do.” When he arrived in November 2015, Roshid was supported by the IOM for five months, receiving food, pocket money and rent. He says he then got some assistance from the Australian government for another 20 months, but it has been almost two years since he got any help. The IOM confirms it was contracted to provide services for six months, but says it can not provide further details about individuals for privacy reasons. The IOM has previously told Al Jazeera its staff thought “long and hard” about getting involved with the Cambodia deal. “[We] came down to the difficult … decision that this was the best that we could do for these vulnerable migrants,” spokesman Joe Lowry says. “We pushed very hard for the highest possible levels of services to these people to try to be as pro-migrant as we can be, as we need to be to retain our credibility.” ‘On many occasions I was beaten’ The most recent organisation to offer Roshid help, Connect Settlement Services, gave him a small cart so he could start a small business as a street vendor and support himself and his wife, a fellow Rohingya whom Roshid met in Cambodia. “I have been trying so hard to sell roti but it is so difficult for me to get a spot to sell my roti because all the main spots are taken by the Cambodians,” he tells Guardian Australia. “I often try to go early to obtain a good spot but I am always kicked out by locals. They say you are not from here. On many occasions I was beaten and my money was taken away from me because I didn’t leave. I reported these events to the Australian immigration but no action was taken. So I realised that justice would not be served for me. “I have no choice except to leave and find another spot where I can barely sell a few roti.” Connect Settlement Services was paid $1.32m to care for the handful of refugees in Cambodia, for 14 months until late 2016. It was also paid $77.7m for two years’ work providing services to the detainees on Nauru, but declined to renew its contracts in September 2016, saying the work required was beyond them. The next day it also ended its Cambodian contract. Graham Thom, a spokesman for Amnesty International Australia, says the organisation was always concerned about the long-term status of refugees who went to Cambodia. “It’s very difficult for people of any description, let alone refugees, to get citizenship in Cambodia,” Thom says. “Without it, you are extremely vulnerable. That’s why we generally see people resettled from those countries, not to those countries.” Shortly after Cambodia and Australia signed its deal, Cambodian officials visited the detention centre on Nauru. Roshid told the Khmer Times last year he was asked three times to go to Cambodia by immigration detention centre staff, who told him his asylum claim had “no hope”. Having been in detention for two years, he said yes. “I finally felt my chances would be better in Cambodia than Australia.” There was little information about what was ahead of those who chose to move to Cambodia. There were no apparent guarantees from Australia of access to health or education. The Kaldor Centre reported that no volunteers came forward, and rumours spread that vulnerable asylum seekers were under pressure to step up and prevent the embarrassment to Australia of a failed deal. Freedom is elsewhere In November 2016, Australia struck a deal with the US government for it to resettle up to 1,250 people held on Nauru or Manus. About 900 have already gone or are preparing to go. New Zealand has also maintained its offer to resettle 150 people from the Manus and Nauru cohorts every year, and while the Australian Coalition government has consistently rejected it, there are signs it may be wavering. A growing number are now finding their own paths to freedom, through private sponsorship in other countries such as Switzerland and Canada. But for Roshid, freedom in Cambodia is fraught with obstacles and he is desperate for another country to offer him a chance to make a decent life for himself. “There were many times when people took my money and I couldn’t report it anywhere. No one recognises my paper. I will always be considered an outsider, and I can’t see a clear path to citizenship in this country. So I will always struggle with my life here. I am just stuck in limbo without a future in sight.” The Department of Home Affairs tells Guardian Australia the government has fulfilled its agreements with those settled in Cambodia. A spokesman says it does not comment on individual cases, but that those resettled in Cambodia received “comprehensive support, including financial support, healthcare, housing, education and family reunification”. “Individuals also received assistance to apply for and obtain refugee documentation. These documents allowed individuals to obtain a driver’s license, travel documents and confirmed work rights,” he says. Refugees living in Cambodia were eligible to apply for Khmer nationality through naturalisation after seven years, he says. Guardian Australia has contacted the Cambodian government for confirmation. Amnesty’s Thom says Australia has to take responsibility for Roshid. “It was a deal they signed with Cambodia and it was never going to be a long-term solution, they have to realise that,” he says. “Australia has invested at least $55m into their solution but it hasn’t worked. They have to accept that and ensure that at a minimum he can be eligible for the US deal.” The US state department has indicated there is no avenue for Roshid to pursue resettlement through the Australian program. A spokesman tells Guardian Australia the US’s arrangement with Australia was for eligible refugees referred to it by the UNHCR who currently reside in Australia’s regional processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, or who are temporarily in Australia for medical reasons. It refers further questions to the Australian government."
2019-10-08T15:04:33Z,13 women dead and eight children missing after boat capsizes off Italy,"At least 13 women have died and eight children are missing after a boat capsized in rough seas off the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday night as a patrol vessel attempted to save it. Italian authorities have rescued 22 survivors from the boat, which was carrying about 50 people. Only four of the 13 recovered bodies have been identified by surviving family members, including that of a 12-year-old girl. According to an initial reconstruction of events, all the people onboard moved to one end of the vessel as the rescue boat arrived, causing it to overturn. The boat, carrying mostly people from sub-Saharan Africa, had initially left Libya before sailing along the coast to reach the city of Sfax, in Tunisia, where another 15 people boarded before they continued their journey to Sicily, according to survivors. Sicilian prosecutors from Agrigento who are investigating the shipwreck emphasise that, for some time now, the route from Tunisia has been increasingly favoured by refugees and migrants attempting to reach Europe. “People are leaving from Libya less and less and as a result the vast majority of migrants come from Tunisia,” the Agrigento prosecutor, Salvatore Vella, said. About 2,500 people have arrived in Italy by sea from north Africa in September, and almost all of them left from Tunisia, usually from the coastal city of Zarzis. The arrivals by sea to Italy in September represent a third of the 7,637 who have landed since the start of the year, according to data from the Interior Ministry. The Tunisia route, though shorter than from Libya, can, however, be more risky. “The goal for those departing from Tunisia is to reach the Sicilian coast directly and evade controls,” said Vella. “This means that migrants do not launch an SOS as has happened from those leaving Libya. This, of course, makes the journey more dangerous.” They are called “phantom landings” and for some years now they have been an increasingly common way of travelling with boats, upon landing, often abandoned on Sicilian beaches. Meanwhile in Brussels, the migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, urged member states to back a temporary plan to quickly get migrants off boats in the Mediterranean Sea and distribute them among willing countries. Germany, France, Italy and Malta are seeking approval from their EU partners for a “fast-track” process to screen migrants, relocate asylum-seekers and return people who do not qualify for asylum. “It’s a moment for all member states to show more solidarity and more responsibility,” Avramopoulos told reporters in Luxembourg, “We cannot continue like this with what is happening in the Mediterranean. We need permanent mechanisms,” he said. The 27 ministers – minus the UK - were also confronted with a stark warning that the eastern Mediterranean shows signs of an “emerging crisis”, following a rise in people seeking asylum. Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus – three countries facing increased numbers of asylum seekers arriving via sea and land from Turkey – issued a joint paper that said: “Although the current situation is different from the crisis of 2015 to early 2016, it contains alarming elements of an emerging crisis. Europe cannot be caught unprepared for a second time.” The three countries urge the EU to devote more funds to migration in its next seven-year budget to help them manage the flow of people. Separately, a leaked document from the European commission revealed that Greece was recording the highest number of weekly arrivals since spring 2016, when a controversial EU-Turkey deal took effect. In March 2016, the EU promised to pay €6bn to refugee charities in Turkey, if Ankara took action to prevent people getting on people smugglers’ boats. Numbers fell dramatically, but have risen sharply in 2019: in August almost 8,000 asylum seekers arrived in Greece over the sea, compared with about 5,000 in July. Greece is also facing a sharp increase in asylum seekers travelling over its land border with Turkey, with arrivals more than doubling to 1,500 in August (compared with the previous month). About three-quarters of people using the land route are Turkish nationals. More than 1 million migrants arrived in the EU in 2015, most of them from Syria or Iraq, sparking one of Europe’s biggest political crises in recent times as nations bickered over who should take responsibility for them. “A strong agreement will help save lives and demonstrate that EU countries are committed to working together to uphold basic values and international obligations,” said the Amnesty migration researcher, Matteo de Bellis. Since 2013, almost 20,000 migrants have died trying to reach Europe."
2019-11-13T16:23:00Z,Syrian refugees ask Norway police to investigate war crimes,"Syrian refugees in Norway have joined a pan-European drive for justice over torture, extra-judicial killings and other abuse, making a landmark request for Norwegian police to investigate atrocities committed during Syria’s long civil war. Five torture survivors filed statements on what they endured and witnessed in more than a dozen prisons, and provided a dossier of evidence linking the mistreatment to 17 named, high-ranking officials in the Syrian government. Abuse included extrajudicial killings, rape, beatings and floggings, often on the soles of their feet, hanging victims by their wrists for long periods, pulling out fingernails and using electric shocks. “I am still suffering from the effects of the torture,” said one of the group, who asked to be known only as Mira to protect family still in Syria. “For the last eight years, I can’t get even two hours of sleep. Even with all the sedatives and painkillers, I still just relive what happened in the prisons, hour by hour.” The move comes weeks after German prosecutors made a historic decision to charge two alleged former Syrian secret services officers with crimes against humanity, setting the stage for the first trial over state-sponsored torture in Syria to be held anywhere in the world. The two suspects had come to Germany as refugees, and were arrested earlier this year after campaigners handed over a dossier of evidence similar to that submitted in Norway. Horrific testimony and detailed documentation of atrocities has been filtering across Syria’s borders since soon after the war began in 2011, but the international community has struggled to respond with any concerted push for accountability. Syria is not a party to the treaty that established the international criminal court (ICC), and Russia and China have vetoed efforts to mandate the ICC to set up a special tribunal for Syria. In the vacuum, activists and human rights lawyers have been working on a patchwork of efforts to seek justice and dispel a sense of impunity, using national laws, particularly in countries where Syrian refugees have settled or where high-ranking officials have connections. In Norway, they are relying on a provision in the penal code – universal jurisdiction – that allows authorities to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity even if they were committed outside the country by people who are not Norwegian. Previous Norwegian war crimes investigations have focused on perpetrators who had settled in Norway after carrying out atrocities elsewhere. “We are asking Norwegian authorities to do something they have not done before. But we are convinced we are not asking them to do something impossible,” said Gunnar Ekeløve-Slydal from the Norwegian Helsinki committee, which is supporting the case. Universal jurisdiction also applies in Germany, Sweden and Austria, and campaigners have used it to file cases in all three countries. Germany, where these efforts began, has already proved that this approach offers a new path towards some accountability. “When we first started, people said: ‘You are crazy, no one will hand out arrest warrants,’” said Patrick Kroker, from the Berlin-based European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights, which is helping coordinate the criminal complaints. Now two men face trial over abuse, and Germany has an international arrest warrant out for Jamil Hassan, the head of the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate. The cases have been vital in sending a message to Syrian officials that “they are not all-powerful, it is not a wall of impunity”, Kroker added. Lawyers also hope the German prosecutors’ decision to take the cases forward will encourage progress in other countries. “I am optimistic about proceedings across Europe, even if some countries are slower. What happens in one country pushes the others,” said Anwar al-Bunni, a Syrian human rights lawyer who was himself jailed more than once before escaping the country, and has played a key role in bringing the cases. The Norwegian case is not only about seeking justice for historic crimes, witnesses say. Nearly nine years into Syria’s civil war, Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his hold on power on the ground, with the help of Russian and Iranian backers. The country’s jails are still full of prisoners at risk of abuse. “There are hundreds of thousands of detainees still in the government’s centres and I feel for them, because I was once a detainee,” said one man who gave testimony in Norway. “We’ve started this just to make those [officials] over there feel there are consequences for their actions.” Because Norwegian law does not allow trial in absentia, the best result that the Syrians and their lawyers can hope for is that police, after investigating, issue arrest warrants for the people named. But even that will be a significant victory, they say. “Catching is not my target now. My first aim is to send a message of hope to victims – ‘someone cares about you getting justice,” said Bunni. “Then I want the criminals who committed these crimes, who feel comfortable and think they have impunity, to know their position will not protect them.”"
2019-11-13T15:13:42Z,"Greek refugee camp for 640 people is found to be housing 3,745","An EU-funded refugee camp on the Greek island of Samos built to house 640 people is home to 3,745, with unaccompanied children forced to sleep on the floor of windowless and overcrowded containers, an official audit has revealed. Other children were found to be living in makeshift tents or in derelict buildings on the outskirts of the camp in what the special report from the European court of auditors described as “dire conditions”. “Seventy-eight unaccompanied minors were in tents or abandoned derelict houses outside the hot spot, in unofficial extensions to the facility,” the auditors said. “Nine unaccompanied girls were sleeping on the floor in a 10 metre sq container next to the police office, with no bathroom or shower.” The situation at Greek facilities on Samos and at the island of Lesbos are described as “highly critical in terms of capacity and the situation of unaccompanied minors”, due to a failure of the bloc’s relocation and return scheme for migrants coming to Europe from countries such as Syria. The auditors’ findings were echoed on Wednesday in appeals made by the mayor of Samos, Georgios Stantzos, who warned of riots due to the “primitive” conditions. Last month, a fire broke out in the camp after a brawl in town between rival groups of Syrians and Afghans. “People are camping in dry stream beds,” Stantzos told Agence France-Presse. “They are at risk from fires and floods. [Camp residents] organise their own housing, water supply and sanitation in completely primitive ways. We are trying to remain calm but the situation is not manageable ... it gets worse every day. We are past the red line. Any random event ... could lead to terrible results. At the peak of the migration crisis, EU countries set a target of relocating 160,000 newly arrived migrants. Member states later legally agreed to revise down the plan to relocate 98,256 people. Of those, only 34,705 – 21,999 from Greece and 12,706 from Italy – were found new homes in the EU. Countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have refused to fulfil their obligations. The auditors found that relocation schemes in Italy and Greece, which is the focus of their report, had underperformed mainly due to the very low share of potentially eligible migrants registering for relocation. Authorities were said to be unable to identify all potential candidates and successfully channel them towards applying for relocation. But there were also major systemic problems making the schemes unattractive to applicants. In Greece, people seeking relocation from camps waited an average of 215 days from application to decision last year. A shortage of doctors to assess the vulnerability of applicants was said to be a key factor. In Italy, the large number of appeals against decisions has led to a backlog. The auditors said it took on average over four years for an asylum application lodged in 2015 to reach the final appeal stage. The problems have led to unacceptable conditions in the camps, where the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières reported an increase in claims of harassment, sexual assault and other forms of violence. The European court of auditors made their visit to the camps in February. The European commission has accepted a series of recommendations in the report, including the upgrading of facilities. However, a formal response published alongside the report added that “the responsibility to establish a sustainable system for unaccompanied minors lies with the Greek authorities, and not with the commission”. Leo Brincat, a member of the team responsible for the report, called for all EU institutions and member states to step up and avoid passing the buck."
2019-09-08T07:00:38Z,The big picture: Honduran migrants on their way to the US border,"Early in the morning of 28 October 2018, photographer Guillermo Arias released his camera into the air above an outdoor basketball court in San Pedro Tapanatepec, in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. As it rose, the camera, attached to a drone, took in a densely crowded scene: migrants from Honduras resting on their 2,700-mile journey towards the US border. “The open court allowed me to use my drone to show a unique perspective on a familiar scene,” says Arias. “It also, despite being photographed at a distance, offers an intimate view on people’s first moments of the day without being invasive.” A week earlier, Arias, who lives in the northern state of Tijuana, had received an assignment from his editor at Agence France Presse to spend 12 days following a caravan of Central American migrants on their journey north. “I didn’t hesitate,” he says. “I’ve being working on migration themes over the past 15 years but I never got the chance to work on Mexico’s southern border.” The caravans first came to widespread attention in early 2018, when migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador fleeing persecution, poverty, violence and the effects of drought began gathering together in large numbers on their way north. “People who commonly travelled in small groups, hidden from the authorities and away from the media’s eye, were suddenly out in the open walking together, being intentionally visible,” says Arias. Many sought to settle in the US, despite official warnings against illegal entry and increasingly heated rhetoric from Donald Trump, who branded the caravans “an invasion”. With his images of the late 2018 caravan, which brought more than 7,000 people to the US-Mexico border a month later – the images are now on show at the International Festival of Photojournalism in Perpignan, France – Arias captured the precariousness and weariness of the migrants, as well as a sense of unity and solidarity. “This was a very special and unique opportunity to see and tell their stories,” he says, “but most of all, it is a political statement against Central American governments who ejected their own people due to extreme levels of insecurity and poverty.”"
2019-01-15T07:00:11Z,UN refugee chief: I would risk death to escape a squalid migrant camp,"The head of the UN refugee agency has said he too would do “anything” to escape if he was stuck in a squalid refugee camp, as he called on the world’s wealthy nations to properly fund services in developing countries. Speaking to reporters after meeting the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Filippo Grandi, the high commissioner for refugees, said countries are not getting enough recognition for hosting refugees, and that he would campaign for Cairo to receive more bilateral development aid to support its efforts. According to the latest figures, Egypt hosts more than 242,000 registered refugees of 58 different nationalities, mainly concentrated in Greater Cairo, Alexandria and the north coast, 55% of them fleeing the war in Syria. While migrant flows to Europe across the dangerous Mediterranean sea route had fallen sharply, Grandi said, that decline had not reduced the number of people fleeing war and poverty flocking to holding camps in places like Libya. “If I was a refugee or a migrant or anybody going into this centre I would opt for anything to get out of there, even if I knew the risk of death was very high,” Grandi said, adding that what Libya needed was help to enforce the rule of law instead of just naval support, as well as aid to stop illegal people trafficking. Seeking similar arrangements to those in eastern Europe, EU leaders have been urging Egypt to help stem the flow of people entering Europe from Africa, offering to step up economic cooperation as an incentive. Cairo, however, has stopped short of setting up the “disembarkation platforms” Europe seeks, where people rescued at sea could be dropped off for screening. Grandi made his comments as Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms said on Monday that Spanish authorities were preventing its ship from setting sail in the Mediterranean. “We are blocked in a port once again. Port Authority in Barcelona denied permission to Open Arms to sail Med Central,” the charity wrote in a tweet. “Preventing us from saving lives is irresponsible and cruel. Cowardly politicians are putting in place a counter for the dead,” added Proactiva Open Arms founder Oscar Camps in a separate tweet. Proactiva Open Arms operates between Libya and southern Europe, coming to the aid of those who get into difficulties during the crossing from northern Africa. The charity’s ship, the Open Arms, docked in southern Spain on 28 December, with 311 mainly African migrants it had plucked from the sea off Libya, after both Italy and Malta denied the boat entry. Spanish authorities said the vessel had violated maritime regulations by ignoring “the obligation to leave those rescued at sea at the nearest port”. Spain became Europe’s main entry point for refugees last year, overtaking Greece and Italy, which have taken measures to prevent those rescued from landing in its ports."
2019-11-05T18:21:49Z,France to set migrant worker quotas in bid to appeal to rightwing voters,"France will start setting quotas for migrant workers from next year as Emmanuel Macron toughens his stance on immigration in an apparent attempt to appeal to rightwing voters. The French labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, said on Tuesday that France would set quotas for the first time, with the government working with employers to identify industries lacking qualified candidates and where foreigners could fill the gap. “This is about France hiring based on its needs. It’s a new approach, similar to what is done in Canada or Australia,” Penicaud told BFMTV. She did not say how many foreign workers would be granted visas, nor if an applicant’s nationality would be taken into account, a proposal floated last month by the prime minister, Édouard Philippe. The quotas were presented as a way to simplify the hiring process for businesses. Currently, employers have to take part in a complex administrative process and justify why a French citizen cannot be hired for a position they intend to give to a foreign worker needing a visa. With Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally hoping to make gains in local elections in March and Le Pen still seen as Macron’s main political rival in the run up to 2022 presidential elections, the centrist president has recently begun focusing on immigration and hardening his stance. The number of foreigners in France is not the main worry of the electorate – who are more concerned about making ends meet and growing fears over the climate crisis – but Le Pen’s anti-immigration party continues to focus on the issue and is seeking to win over voters from the mainstream right. Macron, who was elected with support from voters on both the right and left, appears to be preparing the ground for a second presidential stand-off with Le Pen, seeking to address rightwing voters who complain there are too many foreigners in France. Macron has steadily heightened his rhetoric on immigration since September, when he told Europe 1 radio: “France cannot host everyone if it wants to host people well. In order to be able to welcome everyone properly, we should not be too attractive a country.” The question of setting quotas for economic migrants was an idea of the former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 but was never put in place. Macron distanced himself from the idea of quotas during the 2017 election campaign andpraised the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for “saving our collective dignity” by allowing in large numbers of refugees. However, he recently sparked criticism on the left when he gave an interview focused on immigration and Islam to the conservative weekly magazine Valeurs Actuelles, where his views were considered as appealing to readers on the right and far right. When an outraged voter criticised Macron for doing the interview, he said: “You have to speak to everyone.” The prime minister, will unveil a series of measures on Wednesday after France received a record 122,743 asylum requests last year, up 22% from the year before. The new measures could include restrictions on migrants bringing over family members or limiting access to health care for asylum seekers while their claims are processed. France has also called for an overhaul of the EU’s efforts to halt the surge of migrants fleeing conflict and poverty in Asia, the Middle East and Africa since 2015. The French president wants more EU members to share the burden of taking in migrants allowed to stay, a move opposed by several countries in eastern and central Europe. But Macron sparked anger from Bulgaria’s government last week after he said he wanted legal migrants from Guinea or Ivory Coast rather than “clandestine networks of Bulgarians and Ukrainians”."
2019-11-05T11:10:48Z,New Zealand's migrant boom is good news for Māori. It empowers us,"In April 2003, the year New Zealand’s population hit 4 million, statisticians were predicting the country would hit at 4.8 million people in 2046. As in Europe and North America the country’s birth rate was falling, and no one quite knew whether mass immigration would – or even could – continue at pace. Instead, the pressing concern at the time was how to reverse the brain drain. In the mid-2000s almost 40,000 New Zealanders were upping sticks each year. Miners and truck drivers were packing their bags for Queensland’s mining boom. Bankers and lawyers were taking up plum jobs in London. Teachers, nurses, and other public servants were comparing what they made in Wellington with what they might make in Washington or Ottawa. And in that very brief moment it felt as if New Zealand was topping out. In 2008, the aspiring prime minister John Key took a camera crew to the capital city’s 35,000-seat stadium to illustrate just how big mass emigration was. The implication? We were, to repurpose a dangerous phrase, sending our best – to the US and beyond. But the consensus among the commentariat was that Key’s stadium stunt was just that – a stunt – and even if he and his party came to power there was precious little they could do to reverse what was the natural order of things: a stronger Australian economy, its gravitational pull drawing in more and more New Zealanders. Of course the commentators were right. The Australian economy remains stronger on most measures, and mass emigration was still a problem in the Key government’s early years. But one thing no one was anticipating was just how quickly the government would compensate for the brain drain with mass immigration. In 2017, the Key government’s final year in power, net migration (the difference between those coming in or immigrating, including returning New Zealanders, and those going out or emigrating) was at a record 72,300. In 2015, net migration was at 58,000 and in 2013 it was a little shy of 50,000. These are small numbers for countries such as Australia or the UK, sure, but for this country it was momentous. In the 20 years to 2014, average net migration to New Zealand was only 13,300. And this year the country will reach another population landmark: 5 million people. It took more than 20 years to grow from 2 million to 3 million. It took 30 years for it to grow from 3 to 4 million. It took only 16 years to reach 5 million. And we are, because of that growth, a country transformed. Population growth and the capital that comes with it are transforming the Auckland skyline. Tradespeople from Asia, the Philippines especially, are in good part responsible for rebuilding Christchurch after the devastating earthquake in 2011. Tourism and dairy, New Zealand’s leading export industries, are thriving off the back of migrant labour. You can spot the transformation in schools, workplaces and universities, and the streets as well. Māori make up 16.5% of the population, up from 15% in 2013. We’re present in every part of the country’s private and public life, and in a way that was unthinkable half a century ago. Māori make up 23% of MPs – a disproportionate share – and Māori lead or co-lead every sitting parliamentary party, bar Jacinda Ardern’s Labour. It’s fashionable to imagine New Zealand as a 1950s Britain – the temperate climate, a buttoned-down national character, and the things that were best about Britain like a cradle-to-grave welfare system – but in reality this is a Māori country. For a very brief moment in the 80s that fact was at the heart of New Zealand’s constitution. The government understood the country as “bicultural”. Two peoples were in partnership, Māori and the European settlers who came after, and we’d run the show as equals. Sure, there was a gap – sometimes even a chasm – between promise and practice, but the aspiration was there. The problem, though, is mass immigration from the 90s onwards quickly made biculturalism unworkable. In 2019, Asian peoples make up 15% of the population and Pacific peoples another 8%. In this new country only one kind of culturalism works: multi. For people who oppose Māori reasserting their claim on political powerthis is great news. Māori are just one minority among many, the opponents insist, claiming they’re not even indigenous. But for the small number of Māori who tie their political claims to their demographic power it’s quite terrible. On current trends Asian peoples will overtake Māori as the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand. This is an “ethnic-cultural tension point”, as the country’s leading demographer put it, confirming that in every settler colony, population politics is toxic. Except when it isn’t. The truth is immigration isn’t diminishing Māori claims on political power. It’s strengthening those claims, pushing each one forward. At Ihumātaohundreds of land protectors are occupying the historic site and reclaiming it for the local tribes. Among the occupiers are groups such as “Asians for Tino Rangatiratanga” meaning Asians for Māori political power. Visitors to the land and supporters of the occupation include west African Islamic scholars, Cook Islands royalty, and indigenous Taiwanese people. This is what sets New Zealand apart – and maybe above – other countries in the Anglosphere. Māori rights aren’t contingent on their status as a (growing) minority. Population power doesn’t secure our rights. The Treaty of Waitangi does. The country’s founding document reaffirms Māori political power (in the treaty’s own words it reaffirms our “tino rangatiratanga”). And equally so the treaty protects migrants, guaranteeing that New Zealand is their place to stand as well. The only thing the treaty expects of them is to recognise and respect Māori political power. The bargain is that simple and, if Ihumātao is any guide, it’s one that migrants are more than willing to make. This is the reason I’m so happy about New Zealand at 5 million.

2020-09-12T07:36:58Z,UK urged to take in refugees after fire at Lesbos migrant camp,"Pressure is mounting on the UK government to take in some of the thousands of asylum seekers left without shelter following a devastating fire at Europe’s largest migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. The blaze tore through the Moria registration and identification centre (RIC) overnight on Tuesday, incinerating tents that had been home to 13,000 people, including at least 4,000 children. Germany and France are to take in children hit by the fire but the UK has yet to offer any assistance. Since last October, the Greek government has been appealing for help from other countries to take in asylum-seeking children from its islands; 13 countries, including non-EU states Norway and Switzerland, have taken part but the UK has refused to help. The fire has made the situation on Lesbos even more critical. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, urged the government to act. He said: “The government should live up to our responsibilities and promises as a country and look to work with international partners so we can immediately offer sanctuary and home to some of the unaccompanied children in this terrible situation.” More than 70 civil society organisations have signed a call for action urging governments to take in people displaced by the Moria camp fire. Stephanie Pope, EU and UN policy and advocacy manager at Refugee Rights Europe, said: “While we are shocked and saddened by the horrific images of Moria burning, they come as no surprise. The devastating fires are yet another reminder of the tragic human cost of a European asylum and migration system based on containment and deterrence policies. “Thousands of individuals, including roughly 4,000 children, have been left homeless and traumatised. We urge all European governments including the UK, to uphold their commitment to human rights and show solidarity with these individuals, by relocating a number of them to safety without delay.” Ruth Tanner, the head of Oxfam’s humanitarian campaigns, said: “The ongoing humanitarian tragedy in the camp and now this devastating fire are an urgent reminder to the UK government that it should be doing its fair share for people fleeing conflict and persecution. “The UK’s resettlement operations, which were paused due to the pandemic, should be urgently restarted. The UK government needs to provide adequate safe and legal routes for refugees to reach the UK and allow more refugee families to be reunited in safety here.” In a letter to the home secretary, Lord Dubs, who was a child refugee himself, said: “The situation in Greece is an international emergency and it requires international cooperation to find a solution. As a leading nation on the world stage, I hope the UK will play its role in making sure that children are relocated from this horrendous situation as soon as possible.” In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed byDubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The process was subsequently referred to as the Dubs scheme. The government capped the Dubs scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this. The cap has been met so the scheme has in effect ended; however, the legislation remains and the government could take more children under the scheme if it chose to do so. The tragedy underlines the importance of establishing a credible replacement for European laws – known as the Dublin regulation – which govern family reunion for unaccompanied minors who have relatives in the UK, campaigners say. When the transition period ends on 31 December, so will the UK’s obligations under the Dublin regulation. The UK also suspended its global resettlement scheme, designed to transfer recognised refugees from an another country, due to the pandemic and has yet to restart it. Refugees International advocate Daphne Panayotatos, said: “The devastation caused by the fires in Moria has only underscored what the world already knew about the indignity, unsustainability and danger of holding people in the miserable conditions in Lesbos. “The UK and other European countries have taken only minimal steps in response to Greece’s requests for assistance. By keeping resettlement operations on hold, the UK has further abdicated its responsibility to people seeking safety in Europe. With tens of thousands in Lesbos now left with nowhere to go, the UK should immediately step up to take in more vulnerable asylum seekers, resume resettlement, and facilitate family reunification.”"
2020-08-29T22:33:14Z,UN refugee agency calls on EU nations to let in migrants rescued in Mediterranean,"The UN refugee agency urged European nations on Saturday to let in hundreds of migrants rescued from the Mediterranean by humanitarian boats, including one financed by the British street artist Banksy. The UNHCR and the International Organization of Migration (IOM) said more than 200 rescued refugees and migrants needed immediately to get off the nonprofit search-and-rescue ship Louise Michel, saying it was far beyond its safe capacity. The plea from UNHCR and IOM also mentioned hundreds of migrants on two other charity ships in urgent need of safe harbour. The agencies said 27 migrants who left from Libya, including a pregnant woman and children, had been stranded on the commercial tanker Maersk Etienne for an unacceptable three-week period since their rescue on 5 August. A further 200 rescued people on the SeaWatch4, which waited for days to be allowed to enter a port, also needed urgent help, the agencies added. The humanitarian imperative of saving lives should not be penalised or stigmatised, especially in the absence of dedicated state-led efforts, they said. They also reiterated concerns about the lack of dedicated EU-led search-and-rescue operations in the central Mediterranean, and the lack of coordination among European nations to support countries like Italy and Malta, which are bearing the brunt of migrants arriving by sea. Earlier on Saturday, the Italian coastguard answered a distress call from the Louise Michel, which was financed by Banksy, and took charge of 49 of the migrants who were most in need of help, it said. By late Saturday night, all passengers on the Louise Michel had been transferred to the SeaWatch4, which was left with about 350 people on board – allowing the Louise Michel to continue its mission in the Mediterranean, while the SeaWatch4 was looking for a safe seaport to disembark the passengers. The Louise Michel had become stranded at sea after the crew helped 130 migrants, with the ship’s leaders saying that requests for help from European authorities had been ignored. The vessel, named after a French feminist anarchist, set off in secrecy on 18 August from the Spanish seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, and went to the central Mediterranean, where, on Thursday, it rescued 89 people including 14 women and four children. It had been safeguarding more than 200 people off Libya’s coast. On Friday, the crew of European activists responded to a mayday call by Moonbird, an aircraft that monitors migrants’ boats in danger in the central Mediterranean, which had spotted a dinghy that was not moving and was taking in water. “Louise Michel proceeded at full speed,” a ship spokesperson said. “We handed out life vests to 130 people to secure the situation.” The rubber dinghy was located in the Maltese search and rescue zone, dangerously overcrowded and taking in water, with several on board suffering from fuel burns and injuries, after having spent several days at sea. When the Louise Michel made contact there was a dead body on board the vessel, which the coastguard removed. On Saturday, Banksy posted a short video on his personal Instagram account and accompanied by a comment: “Like most people who make it in the art world, I bought a yacht, to cruise the Med. “It’s a French navy vessel we converted into a lifeboat because EU authorities deliberately ignore distress calls from ‘non-Europeans’.” The video ends with the words All Black Lives Matter. The passengers had previously contacted the Alarm Phone, an emergency hotline assisting refugees at sea, and requested immediate rescue. Activists of Alarm Phone and Moonbird alerted European authorities to the boat in distress. The crew alleged that neither the Maltese nor the Italian authorities had reacted adequately. The Louise Michel can safely accommodate a maximum of 120 passengers. The crew said on Twitter: “We are unable to safely move and nobody is coming to our aid. The people rescued have experienced extreme trauma. We need immediate assistance.” Lea Reisner, head of operations for the Louise Michel, said the people rescued had “sat in a mix of salt water and fuel for days”. She accused European states of not doing their job, saying: “They deny responsibility while we are trying to keep everyone alive … We need immediate assistance.” Neeske Beckmann, of the Moonbird, said: “We were shocked when we saw the rubber boat – it was incredibly overcrowded and people on board were trying to shuffle water out of the boat with their bare hands. “We knew this was a grave emergency situation and decided to send out a mayday relay to all authorities and actors in the vicinity. Responsible European authorities failed to react to our distress call and only the Louise Michel responded to this serious distress case.” Painted bright pink and displaying a Banksy artwork depicting a girl in a life vest holding a heart-shaped safety buoy, the Louise Michel sails under a German flag. The 31-metre motor yacht, formerly owned by French customs authorities, is smaller but considerably faster than other NGO rescue vessels. So far in 2020 more than 500 refugees and migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean sea, and the real number is estimated to be considerably higher. On Wednesday 45 people – including five children – died when the engine on their boat exploded off Libya, in the country’s deadliest shipwreck this year, the UN said. More than 19,500 migrants have survived the Mediterranean crossing along the central maritime route this year and reached Italy or Malta."
2020-09-10T17:00:09Z,EU official says asylum policy impasse 'part of the problem' at Moria,"A senior EU official has said Europe’s failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy was partly responsible for the “unacceptable” conditions at the Moria camp on Lesbos that burned to the ground this week, leaving more than 12,000 people without shelter. Ylva Johansson, the European commissioner for home affairs, said that when she took office in December 2019, the situation for 40,000 refugees and migrants living on Greek islands was “unsustainable and unacceptable”. Asked whether Moria – long notorious for overcrowded, filthy conditions – was a result of the commission’s past actions, she said: “Migrant camps on Greek soil are primarily the responsibility of the Greek government.” She added: “The failure [of] the previous commission to actually reach a common European migration and asylum policy is also part of the problem.” Speaking to the Guardian and other European newspapers, Johansson said: “We sometimes say that Europe does not have a migration crisis, and we don’t have that right now. But some migrants are in crisis and that has been the situation in some of these camps.” Following the disastrous fire at Moria, the European commission has promised to fund the transfer of 400 lone children to the Greek mainland, and it is sending a ferry to shelter the most vulnerable people. Johansson highlighted the commission’s actions, working with Athens, to reduce the number of refugees and migrants on the Greek islands, saying the population of Moria had been reduced by almost half in six months: “We were not sitting on our butt to wait for this to happen.” The Swedish social democrat has been charged with drawing up new migration and asylum rules in an effort to heal the open wound over who takes responsibility for people arriving at Europe’s southern borders. The long-delayed migration and asylum pact due on 30 September will propose how frontline countries such as Greece, Italy and Malta can be better helped by their EU neighbours in managing large numbers of arrivals. Johansson declined to confirm whether that meant a legally binding obligation on EU countries to take in refugees – an idea behind some of Europe’s most bitter divisions. She said the problems at Moria were caused “not only” by failure to agree a relocation policy, but also by the absence of swift processes to assess asylum claims and effective means to return people rejected for refugee status to their country of origin. In 2019 the average asylum seeker in Greece could expect to wait nearly 11 months to get an interview to assess their claim after declaring their intention to seek refugee status, according to the Greek Council for Refugees. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, the EU pushed through compulsory refugee quotas in the face of opposition from some central European countries, which flatly refused to shelter asylum seekers. An attempt to reform the system in 2016, based on the idea of mandatory solidarity payments by refusenik countries, foundered. The commissioner, a former employment and integration minister, also said she would like EU monitoring to prevent illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at the EU border. In May, the Guardian found that Malta was using private companies to intercept migrant boats and return potential asylum seekers to Libya. Amid escalating tensions with Turkey, the Greek government was reported by the New York Times to have set up a “black site” where migrants were held without legal recourse before being pushed back into Turkey. “I am very concerned about reports of pushbacks,” Johansson said. “For me it is a fundamental right to have a right to apply for asylum … and that’s why I am considering introducing a monitoring mechanism in the pact to make sure that people have this right at the borders.” She did not give details on how that mechanism might work. The migration pact is expected to intensify EU efforts to return failed asylum seekers to their country of origin, as well as proposing legal routes for people seeking to work in Europe. The EU will also put more attention on taking refugees from non-EU countries via resettlement programmes. The ideas will only come into force with the consent of EU governments. Despite low expectations, Johansson said she was optimistic about finding a compromise on this “very, very difficult exercise”, citing the agreement on the coronavirus recovery plan that had sharply divided member states. “But I guess when I present my pact, nobody would be happy,” she added."
2020-10-20T12:12:38Z,Greece extends wall on Turkish border as refugee row deepens,"Greece has begun extending a border wall along its frontier with Turkey to deter migrants from trying to enter the European Union, the Greek government has said, after a border standoff earlier this year which has helped drive Greek-Turkish relations to a dangerously low ebb. A total of 16 miles (26km) of wall will be added to the existing 6 mile fence along the Evros River, which forms much of the Greek-Turkish border, the government spokesperson Stelios Petsas said on Monday. The €63m (£57.5m) extension will add 5 metre-high fencing and upgrade the existing sections of the wall by using galvanized square steel tubes and concrete foundations, Petsas said. The work is due to be completed in April. Turkey hosts around 4 million refugees, mostly from Syria. It often threatens to reopen the migrant route from the Middle East, which at its peak in 2015 resulted in thousands of people drowning in the Mediterranean Sea and about 1 million people reaching Greece and Italy where many still live in crowded displacement camps. In February this year, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe, in an attempt to pressure its western allies into supporting a Turkish military campaign in Syria’s Idlib province. As a result, tens of thousands of refugees and migrants living in Turkey attempted to cross by land and sea to Greece and Bulgaria in March, although the movement was quickly halted by the outbreak of coronavirus. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 7,357 people crossed from Turkey into Greece in the first quarter of 2020 - only slightly higher than the figures recorded in the same period of the previous year, although deaths at sea increased from 19 to 67 people. The standoff, however, has still led to tougher border control tactics. Turkey has accused Greece of illegally pushing back migrants reaching its islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, a charge Athens denies, while Greece says Turkey sends patrol vessels to escort migrant boats into its waters. Greek police told the Associated Press they had started trialling high-powered mobile sirens aimed at deterring migrants as they attempted to cross from Turkey, and an upgraded surveillance camera network is also planned to cover the entire 120 mile Greek-Turkish border. “The cameras will be a vital resource for us,” said Ilias Akidis, the head of the police officers’ association in the Greek border region. “We have been asking for them for five years and we think they will be very effective.” The plight of refugees and migrants has been steadily weaponised by Turkish and Greek politicians over the last five years. Relations between the two countries, frosty at the best of times, have fallen into a deepening crisis in recent months. Disagreements over Cyprus, refugee flows and oil and gas drilling rights in the Mediterranean have drawn in other countries in the region, and for the first time in decades prompted fears of direct clashes between the two Nato allies."
2020-12-23T16:16:50Z,Fire destroys migrant camp in Bosnia,"A fast-moving fire has destroyed a migrant camp in Bosnia strongly criticised by rights groups as inadequate due to its lack of resources. The blaze broke out at the Lipa camp, close to the border with Croatia, on the same day the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had declared the effective closure of the facility, saying Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to supply basic services. Thick black smoke could be seen rising as residents, mainly from the Middle East, south Asia and north Africa, fled in panic. A UN official said the blaze was believed to have been started by migrants unhappy at the camp’s temporary closure. “As far as we know now, a group of former residents put three tents and containers on fire after most of the migrants had left the camp,” said Peter Van der Auweraert of the IOM. He said to his knowledge there were no casualties. The IOM has urged Bosnian authorities to make the camp fit for winter and offer an alternative shelter option while the work is being conducted. Hundreds of migrants, including children, are now left without shelter as temperatures in Bosnia are expected to go as low as -4C. Bosnia has become a bottleneck for thousands of migrants hoping to reach the EU. Most are concentrated in the country’s north-western Bosanska Krajina region as other regions in the ethnically divided nation refuse to accept them. From there they attempt to cross the border with Croatia into the EU, and contend with pushbacks. Bosnian authorities ordered the transfer of thousands of migrants to the remote temporary camp in March at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. A few weeks ago, when temperatures fell to -6C, more than 1,400 people were still living in the camp. The shower and toilet facilities had frozen and people were forced to use the surrounding woods to relieve themselves. The EU has warned Bosnia that thousands of migrants face a freezing winter without shelter, and urged the country’s political authorities to set aside their differences and take action. But others believe that behind the incident in Lipa a deep political rift is developing between the UN and the EU, and the Bosnian authorities. Attempts to reopen another camp, Bira, in the Bihać region have run into opposition after it was closed at the end of September by the Una-Sana canton authorities. “What is happening in Bihać is a political crisis that has been brewing for nearly two years,” said Paola Lucchesi, a former journalist based in Bihać and president of the NGO Centar za Odrzivi Razvoj “Una”. “In the last two months, a standoff between the cantonal and municipal authorities and the IOM, that acts as an operational partner for the EU commission, has escalated to the point of a full-blown constitutional crisis within the country,” she added."
2020-10-08T12:07:58Z,Europe's migration 'crisis' isn't about numbers. It's about prejudice,"Fortress Europe is being redesigned – but it is no easy task. European Union home affairs ministers on Thursday began the process of repairing the bloc’s broken migration policy, just weeks after the tragic devastation of the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos. Expect no quick changes, however. The 27 countries are deeply divided over proposals for a new “pact” on asylum and migration. The European commission’s plan calls for faster pre-entry screening and quick returns of those who fail to quality for asylum. The focus is on ending sometimes deliberately slow, inhumane and inefficient border management procedures, which lead to squalid, overcrowded camps such as Moria, where people can be left in limbo for years. The return of those denied asylum could be managed with a newly appointed “EU returns coordinator”. EU data shows that on average approximately 370,000 applications are rejected each year, but only a third of people are expelled. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, is hoping that these and other changes will convince EU governments to view migration not as an evil but as an asset that has “defined our societies, enriched our cultures and shaped many of our lives”. But Europe’s anti-migration hardliners are having none of it. The key concern of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech republic is that refugees must be kept in “hotspots” or camps outside EU territory while asylum claims are processed, although – so far, at least – no one seems to favour Priti Patel’s bizarre scheme for sending asylum-seekers to Ascension Island in the south Atlantic. Europe’s progressives, on the other hand, worry that the commission proposals pander too much to the far right. Rights agencies and NGOs warn that the pact may weaken protection for some of the world’s most vulnerable people. EU polarisation over migration is not new. Germany and Sweden welcomed many of the 1.5 million refugees fleeing Middle Eastern wars five years ago, but the bloc’s eastern states looked the other way. Later they blocked EU efforts to introduce a system of quotas for redistributing refugees among the 27 member states. The number of asylum seekers is now down, but for many EU governments the migration “crisis” will never be over. That is because the problem has never really been about numbers. Europe’s relentless arguments over border controls, asylum claims and mandatory or voluntary “solidarity” hide a darker discussion and a deeper divide. Pride and prejudice are the real obstacles standing in the way of a well-managed EU policy on migration. The migration discussion is entangled in Europe’s dismal record on racism, the rise in anti-Muslim sentiment and the continent’s complex post-colonial relations with its southern, especially African, neighbours. At stake is the EU’s commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Also at risk is the EU’s global reputation. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson may say she wants to take the drama out of migration and make the the policy a “normal one”. But before they can agree on new migration rules, politicians and policymakers will have to tackle three closely related but seemingly unconnected challenges. First, Europe must confront – and change - its biases on race, religion and ethnicity. Second, there should be an honest conversation on European values and identity. Third, Europe needs to acknowledge the urgency of rebooting relations with African states and other emerging countries. By coincidence rather than by design, along with the migration proposals, all three questions are currently on the agenda. After Black Lives Matter protests erupted across Europe in May, von der Leyen vowed an array of actions to dismantle structural racism including ensuring more racial diversity in “Brussels So White” institutions. On values, although earlier attempts to impose sanctions on Budapest and Warsaw for breach of EU values are stuck, the EU executive is pursuing closer scrutiny of rule of law violations. And after years of neglecting relations with Africa, there’s finally a much-needed EU focus on building a “partnership of equals” with the continent, although details are still being worked out. These conversations are intimately connected to each other and to the debate on migration. They should be merged into one high-level reflection. Beyond process, the urgent question that requires an answer is: who really speaks for Europe? Is it Viktor Orbán and his allies in the so-called Visegrad group of countries, which wants a closed, white Christian club; or is it von der Leyen waxing lyrical about constructing a “human and humane” anti-racist union? And can there be a true reconciliation of these starkly different – and competing – visions of Europe? There is no easy response. Criticising Orbán’s hate-mongering antisemitic diatribes and rejection of an open “parallel society” where Muslims and Christians live together is easy. But more subtle forms of prejudice abound. The recent denunciation by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of “Islamic separatism” or the nomination of an EU commissioner to “promote the European way of life”, viewed by many as a dog whistle to the anti-migrant camp, are more difficult to call out. In the absence of the moral leadership required for a strong new narrative, that of a multiracial, multi-ethnic and multicultural EU, the bloc’s history and identity will continue to be based on ideas of exclusion and superiority: self-comforting myths where “true Europeans” stand in contrast to unwelcome outsiders and intruders. None of this augurs well for a quick decision on the migration pact, even though the EU clearly needs migrants for their skills and talent but also as contributors to an ageing Europe’s coffers and pension systems. And the pandemic revealed just how many, “essential functions” across the continent are performed by “key workers” who are often migrants. Portugal and Italy introduced temporary amnesty schemes for refugees while others fast-tracked work permits or allowed asylum seekers to work throughout their application process. And while national governments dither even over the humanitarian taking-in of refugee children made homeless at Moria, local communities are responding at the grassroots level. A movement of German towns is arguing they can help alleviate the crisis on their own and has volunteered to bring in more asylum seekers. Even once-hardened anti-migrant German politicians have reportedly started promoting moderate views on migration amid evidence that despite far-right scaremongering refugees are integrating successfully. Securing agreement on a new, more sensible and saner migration management system will be slow and painful. Johansson’s colleagues are unlikely to take up her suggestion to negotiate the new pact with “cool heads and warm hearts”. As the author Hanif Kureishi wrote in 2014: “The immigrant has become a contemporary passion in Europe, the vacant point around which ideals clash.” • Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs"
2020-08-31T07:00:00Z,How helpful is the term 'climate refugee'?,"“You think migration is a challenge to Europe today because of extremism,” John Kerry told a conference in Alaska in 2015, “wait until you see what happens when there’s an absence of water, an absence of food, or one tribe fighting against another for mere survival.” As warnings go, it seemed like the kind we’re used to hearing from politicians in the West. From indulging in inflammatory rhetoric to focusing on the need for ‘control’, alarmist claims about immigration are a regular fixture of political discourse in countries like the US and the UK. The reaction to an increased number of people crossing the Channel in small dinghies to apply for asylum is one of the most recent examples of this. The political fallout has been predictable; right-wing papers have run scaremongering front pages as government ministers claimed that it’s important to make border policies even tighter to stop people from making the journey, though the lack of safe and legal routes to the UK force them to do so in the first place. Much as during Europe’s summer of 2015, it has been depicted as a “crisis” – not for the people who have to risk their lives but for the place they are trying to get to. But there was something slightly different about Kerry’s prediction five years ago. It represented a new strain of thinking that has developed over the past decade: the climate crisis will mean increased numbers of people migrating. This is where we might increasingly expect political and public discourse will go. The same year of Kerry’s speech, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker declared in his State of the Union address: “Climate change is one of the root causes of a new migration phenomenon. Climate refugees will become a new challenge – if we do not act swiftly.” Two years earlier, Chris Bryant, then Labour’s Shadow immigration minister, asserted: “If we get climate change wrong there is a very real danger we shall see levels of mass migration as yet unparalleled”. There is no agreed-upon definition of who constitutes a ‘climate migrant’ or a ‘climate refugee’. Some of those lobbying for international or regional protections related to these terms say they cover a spectrum: from people who have to move – even if temporarily – because of natural disasters, through to those affected by the slow-onset impacts of the climate emergency. When politicians bring up ‘climate refugees’, they often issue foreboding statements about large numbers of people who fall into this undefined group having to come “here” - usually Europe or the US. Picked up by parts of the far-right and slotting neatly into an immigration debate already fixated on numbers and stopping the movement of particular groups of people, some treat these claims as fact. But on an overcast day in mid-March, a handful of academics and experts giving evidence to the House of Lords EU Home Affairs sub-committee on this very subject came to a different conclusion. As they spoke one after another in a grandly decorated room that’s typical of the Houses of Parliament, the consensus became clear. The term ‘climate migrant’ is not particularly useful. Some argued it is misleading and dangerous. For anyone attuned to the debates about climate and migration, this will come as no surprise, for these are conversations being played out in select academic and activist circles around world. Meanwhile, some of the very people who might fall into the hard-to-define category of ‘climate refugee’ have themselves rejected the term, which is often used in such as way that strips them of their humanity. So what are the potential problems, as well as uses, with the idea of climate migration? And what does this mean for how we should understand movement and the climate crisis more broadly? ‘The fish are migrating; so must we’ “The idea that there will be massive numbers of people arriving or floods – to use this water language – of migrants to European shores is overstated and sensationalised and not to be expected. It will be much more regional,” Dr Caroline Zickgraf told the Lords committee as a clerk in the corner of the room diligently recorded the discussion. An academic who works on migration and climate, Zickgraf firmly rejected the idea that if people have to move because of environmental degradation they will come to Europe or the UK. Sitting next to her, also giving evidence, was Professor Roger Zetter, former director of the Refugee Studies Centre, who cautioned against making grand predictions about what will happen over the next few decades. Many still rely on global figures that have been widely rejected but because there’s so much variation across and within different countries, he said, it’s much better to look at a local level. When you do that, as one report showed, you find that although cross-border migration has garnered more attention, “far more people are migrating within their own countries than across borders” and will likely continue to do so. The evidence shows that “when it [migration] is not internal, it is to neighbouring countries”, Zickgraf said. She gives N’Dar in Senegal as an example, a fishing quarter in the country’s second biggest city where 97% of people are directly dependent on fishing. A combination of coastal erosion and decreasing numbers of fish mean people have to move within the country and toward neighbouring Mauritania. “As one person I interviewed said, ‘The fish are migrating; so must we’.” While political discourse might be focused on ‘climate refugees’, Zickgraf said that countries like the UK will also experience climate displacement due to coastal flooding. Threat multiplier As well as debating where or how many ‘climate refugees’ will move, those in the field are also questioning how useful the concept itself is. Reliant on loaded terms like ‘economic migrant’ and ‘bogus asylum seeker’, popular discussions around immigration often operate on one-dimensional stereotypes. But “migration is always multi-causal,” Zickgraf said. “It is always a combination of social, political, economic, environmental and demographic factors.” By this logic, she argues, it is more productive to understand the climate crisis as “a threat multiplier” that exacerbates existing problems. Climate isn’t irrelevant: it “pose[s] major challenges for populations whose livelihoods are resource dependent, and in some cases that leads to displacement and outright forced migration”. But as some of those advocating for protections related to the term recognise, while there might be some examples where climate appears to be the reason people are forced to leave their homes, in most cases it’s more complicated than that. For Dr Nithya Natarajan this more complex understanding of movement is obscured when we focus only on the climate crisis. “I don’t like the term climate refugee and climate migrant because I think it conceals the fact that it’s an environmentally deterministic argument for migration, which I wholly reject,” explains Natarajan, a lecturer in international development at King’s College London. “I think most of the people who are refugees and migrants because of climate change being the tipping point were poor to begin with and will be poor if we solve climate change. That’s my problem with it – this isn’t just about climate change, it’s about the global development model in their home countries.” Exactly what this looks like and the role the climate crisis plays varies significantly depending on where you’re living. Natarajan has studied India and Cambodia, for example, and says focusing on the climate in these contexts overshadows the way development practices – often those that are Western-led – have actually been the key problem for decades. Though hidden by macro growth figures, she points to the way structural adjustment programmes have created or increased precarity and how farmers and agricultural workers have been forced out of work and given no alternative jobs. Set against this backdrop, some have moved to urban areas where they’re subjected to high levels of exploitation and others have little choice than to take on high levels of debt under the guise of financial inclusion programmes. Natarajan says with debt, for instance, loans are increasingly spun as a way to help people develop climate resilience. But with high interest rates, given to people with little or no collateral, and largely used for daily expenses, many end up having to move for work in order to pay them back. In this instance the “structural causes” of movement “are not climate change. Climate change in a sense exacerbates the pre-existing problems in rural areas.” Asad Rehman, director of the charity War on Want, doesn’t entirely reject the idea of ‘climate migrants’, but says it is only meaningful if understood in an expansive way. “What we’ve been trying to do for over a decade is to try and get ahead of the narrative on climate migration so it doesn’t get narrowed.” One example he gives is economic inequality, which has “left people unable to deal with impact after impact of the climate crisis”. Much like the climate crisis itself – where some of the countries least responsible are those suffering its effects the most – systemic, unequal power relations are relevant to understanding why, when and where people move. But this is rendered invisible if the climate, isolated from everything else, is all that’s thought about. As far as Rehman is concerned, even if the climate crisis isn’t the sole reason people are moving, the focus should be on two things: first, creating a world where people can stay where they are if they want to and second, equipping people with what they need to be able to migrate if they want or have to. “If we think about it in the lens of adaptation,” Minnie Rahman, public affairs and campaigns manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants says, “we can also think about what people might need in the places where they are in order to be able to move safely or to stay safely”. But when nearly half of the world lives on less than five dollars a day and millions don’t have access to electricity that can be near impossible for many. And as one recent report focused on Mali explains, there can often be a gendered aspect to who is able to move and how the climate crisis affects people. “When we talk about climate migration we actually should be talking about how do you address survival migration,” Rehman explains. “It’s actually about access to energy and food, do people have income, do they have access to public services, those are the climate adaptive members that tackle displacement of people.” None of this means regional agreements about climate migration, some of which have already been made, and international protections don’t matter. UNHCR, the international organisation’s refugee agency, doesn’t endorse using the term ‘climate refugee’, largely, it seems, because it’s not a term that exists in international law. Yet they do advocate for developing protections for people who have to move because of environmental changes but who aren’t covered by existing legal frameworks. And those who are critical of the term ‘climate refugee’ are also often keen to stress that it isn’t about trivialising the seriousness of the climate crisis or treating movement and protections related to that as unimportant. Climate nationalism Nevertheless, there is growing concern about how the term operates in current political discussion. A 2013 study argued that ‘climate migration’, even across different approaches, is framed as apocalyptic. The people who move are stripped of their humanity and relative agency, lumped together as the same. In the process, they’re turned into faceless hordes and used as the evidence of the climate crisis. This is partly because ‘climate migration’ contributes to an existing anti-migration narrative where many of the people who move – largely people of colour and those who are poorer – are seen as a problem to be dealt with. And so fear around migration and migrants becomes a rationale for taking climate breakdown seriously. This is an issue for some activists, who do not want concerns about the climate crisis to be channelled into the anti-migration logic that people moving is threatening. But the same 2013 study found there was another potential response to these racialised messages about people coming to Europe: it risks making climate breakdown and the supposed movement related to it also seem unavoidable. That leads people to argue that the only way to respond is with more borders. “In this debate there are people basically saying: ‘Act on climate change because if you don’t there’s going to be all these black and brown people coming, it’s going to be terrible’,” Asad Rehman argues. “The answer for many of these people then is securitised borders [and a] more militarised response…that’s of course just enhancing what’s already happening around the current issues around migration.” This is where the far-right make an appearance. Often known to deny the existence of the climate crisis and hone in on the supposed need to further restrict migration, there is a section of far-right thinking that marries the two together. Steeped in histories of colonial superiority and related to a broader form of climate nationalism, the environmental crisis is a vector through which some far-right figures argue that too many of ‘them’ will come ‘here’. Italy’s Matteo Salvini has said: “What is climate migrant? Where you go? If one is cold in winter and hot in summer, does it migrate? We are serious. We already have many. Is the climate migrant also one of Milan who does not like fog?” And the Freedom Party of Austria has argued “Climate change must never become a recognised reason for asylum,, claiming if it is “the dams will finally break and Europe and Austria will also be flooded with millions of climate refugees.” It is not hard to see how such dehumanising and misleading thinking might fit directly in to the current discussion about asylum in the UK. Whether they’re warning of people ostensibly posing as ‘climate refugees’ or the real thing, these arguments quickly become another justification for protecting ethnonationalist, ostensibly white, borders from people of colour. Rahman argues that the way forward is to ensure that any organising around climate migration has to be done in a way that doesn’t treat movement as a threat. She sees the left as sometimes culpable for reproducing this very discourse, which has also been part of the criticism of the Labour leadership’s response to the recent moral panic over Channel crossings. “The left still doesn’t have a grasp of migrants rights in enough of a way to understand what they will need to do to help this situation once people actually do start moving in a way that speeds up after the climate crisis speeds up,” she says. Rahman suggests that one of the core solutions, no matter where you stand in the debate about the term ‘climate migrants’, is to challenge the way movement is understood as an inherent problem. “The more the left talks about ‘mass migration’ in those terms and also reinforces those fears, the more it allows the right to create this idea that we need protecting from people who are moving even though we have taken no responsibility for why they might be moving at all.”"
2020-12-22T10:30:13Z,Alarm at  Colombia plan to exclude migrants from coronavirus vaccine,"Colombia will refuse to administer coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan refugees within its borders, President Iván Duque has announced, in a move which stunned public health experts and prompted condemnation from humanitarian groups. Speaking to a local radio station on Monday, Duque that only Venezuelans with dual nationality or formal migratory status will have access to the vaccine when it is eventually distributed in the country. According to migration authorities, Colombia currently houses 1.7 million Venezuelans who have fled political repression, economic ruin and widespread food and medicine shortages. Only about 45% have formal status, and hundreds more cross the border unofficially every day. Duque said the controversial decision was taken to prioritize Colombians, and to prevent a rush on the border. “Imagine what we would live through,” he told Blu Radio on Monday morning. “We would have calls to stampede the border as everyone crosses asking for a vaccine.” But the comments prompted an immediate backlash. “Now is the time to show solidarity; vaccinating migrants and refugees costs less than their hospitalization in an intensive care unit,” said Juan Viloria, a Venezuelan doctor in Colombia and the coordinator of Coalition for Venezuela, a migrant rights group. “Not doing so puts thousands at risk, particularly those most vulnerable who do not have anywhere to isolate, wash their hands, or socially distance,” Viloria added. Meanwhile, Colombia faces a resurgent coronavirus outbreak, with cases climbing by over 10,000 a day following months of respite. Lockdowns and other restrictions over the Christmas period have been put in place by local mayors. “Not vaccinating Venezuelans is a bad idea from an epidemiological point of view,” tweeted Alejandro Gaviria, a public intellectual and the dean of Los Andes University in Bogotá. “But it is above all an unethical proposal: it excludes the most vulnerable and discriminates in an almost threatening way against a group of people because of their nationality and immigration status.” Colombia signed deals with the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca last Friday to provide 20m doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Duque said at the time that rollout would begin “in the first weeks of 2021”. Andrés Cubillos-Novella, a professor of public health specializing in migration at the Javeriana University in Bogotá, warned that not vaccinating migrants and refugees would create broader problems for Colombia’s health response. “Many vulnerable migrants live among vulnerable Colombians, and much of that population will be put at risk: access to the vaccine is a question of human rights,” Cubillos-Novella said, adding that the government’s decision may have been made due to financial restraints. “Perhaps that is where international aid could step in.” The Colombian president’s announcement also flies in the face of advice from international organisations which have warned against leaving migrants and refugees behind in vaccination campaigns. “This decision is not ethical or effective,” said Marianne Menjivar, Colombia director for the International Rescue Committee. “We can’t beat Covid anywhere until we beat it everywhere, among all populations, especially those most vulnerable.”"
2020-10-27T20:10:07Z,Hostile rhetoric will not stop refugee children dying in the Channel,"After the death of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler pictured washed up on a Turkish beach, many promises and commitments were made by global leaders to step up their response to the migrant crisis. But today, five years on, we are facing an identical tragedy, and much closer to the UK’s doorstep, raising the question: did Kurdi’s death change anything?’ A five-year-old and an eight-year-old died after falling into the Channel when the boat in which they were travelling, in an attempt to reach the UK, capsized. It is the worst tragedy of its kind in the Channel. Taking such a risk with one’s life, or children’s lives, will be beyond most people’s understanding. The conditions on Tuesday were particularly poor for a crossing, with rain and strong winds – most attempts are taken on calm, clear days. The reasons people risk such a dangerous journey are numerous. They are frequently fleeing torture or death in their home countries. The conditions in northern France are poor and worsening, despite the help many charities offer, with frequent raids on migrant camps, and poor access to healthcare, basic supplies, and legal assistance. Migrants and refugees are often running towards the comfort of family, hoping to be reunited with loved ones in the UK. Humanitarian groups, and some of Britain’s biggest cultural stars, are united in their belief that individuals will continue to want to travel to the UK for a wide variety of reasons. They say it is crucial that the UK government offers safe and legal routes for people to travel to the UK to claim asylum, as migrants cannot claim unless they are on British soil. There are few safe and legal routes. Refugee groups say family reunion rules protected by EU law, known as the Dublin III regulations, are the most effective. But when the transition period ends on 31 December, the UK will no longer offer this route and the EU has dismissed alternatives offered by the UK as “not very operational”. Last week, the government rejected a Lords’ amendment to its immigration bill that would ensure the provisions of the Dublin regulations would continue. Other “safe and legal routes” have been suggested by humanitarian groups and migration experts, none of which is being utilised by the UK government. In 2016, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Alf Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The government capped the scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this and, as the cap has been met, the scheme has, in effect, ended. In October last year, Greece’s immigration minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, asked fellow EU states to help. He wanted countries to take in some of the 4,000-plus unaccompanied children on Greek islands. The European commission ultimately responded and funded a scheme to transfer children off the Greek islands. So far more than 10 countries, including Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the EU, have taken part. But the UK has refused to help. Instead, ministers have taken a hardline approach, vowing to make the crossing “unviable”. The UK government has appointed “a clandestine channel threat commander” to tackle people smuggling and is investigating methods of physically blocking asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel. Ministers and officials have looked at using nets to disable boat engines, locking up migrants on oil rigs, sending them more than 5,000 miles away to Ascension Island in the south Atlantic, and using water cannon to create waves to push back vessels. This is set against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the government directed at asylum seekers, and those who wish to help them. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has called the asylum system “fundamentally broken” and promised new laws to deny asylum to those using illegal routes to enter the UK. All of which has caused dismay among humanitarian organisations, which do not doubt that migrants fleeing from dire circumstances will continue to take risks to reach the UK."
2020-11-30T13:17:49Z,Spain dismantles 'deplorable' migrant camp in Gran Canaria,"Spanish authorities on the island of Gran Canaria have emptied and begun dismantling the much-criticised dockside camp that was used to house thousands of migrants and refugees, as the Canary Islands continue to struggle with a huge rise in migration. The makeshift camp was set up in the town of Arguineguín in August amid a surge in the number of people making the dangerous Atlantic journey from Africa to Europe. So far this year, about 20,000 people have arrived by sea in the Canary Islands – 8,000 of them in November alone. The large volume of people put the archipelago’s reception infrastructure under severe strain and had left the Arguineguín camp accommodating up to 2,600 people in cramped and unsanitary conditions. On Friday, Spain’s public ombudsman called for the camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people’s basic rights. A judge described conditions in the camp as “deplorable”, while Human Rights Watch said they were “pretty awful”. Ángel Victor Torres, the regional president of the Canaries, announced that the “unsustainable” camp had been emptied on Sunday and was being taken down. The people accommodated there were moved to a new a camp in a former military base and to tourist hotels. “I celebrate [the dismantling], but there’s a lot left to do,” Torres wrote on Twitter. “It’s very important that we make sure these people who have risked their lives on the dangerous Atlantic crossing receive dignified and humane treatment. There also need to be controls in their countries of origin, and we need to fight the mafias and speed up transfers and repatriations.” The presence of the migrants and refugees had angered some residents, but Torres called for people on the archipelago to think about the islands’ own long history of migration, adding: “There’s no room for racism in the Canaries.” The mayor of Mogán, the municipality of which Arguineguín is part, said local people’s patience was running out and that the central government needed to move the 6,000 migrants and refugees who are currently being put up in hotels before the end of the year. Txema Santana, of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid, welcomed the closing of the camp but said much more needed to be done. “EU islands can’t only be a reception area where there are thousands of places [for migrants and refugees],” he said on Monday. “The plan for the Canaries will fail unless it includes quick, transparent and regular transfers to the Spanish mainland.” Earlier this month, Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the camp and spoke to some people who had been housed on the dock for more than two weeks. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland,” she told the Guardian. “Those are two very clear solutions.” According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. Eight people died last week when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries."
2020-09-13T17:09:23Z,Greece pledges migrants made homeless will be resettled within days,"Greece has pledged that migrants made homeless after devastating fires at Europe’s biggest refugee camp will be rehoused on the island “within days” in defiance of fierce opposition from locals. The country’s migration minister Notis Mitarachi said the process of resettling more than 12,500 men, women and children forced to flee the facility in Lesbos was well under way even if the coronavirus pandemic meant it was also taking longer. “It will take a few days but all the affected people will be moved into this temporary location behind me,” he told reporters at the site where authorities, with the aid of the army, have been racing to set up tents. “We hope to have 5,000 beds ready by the end of the day.” Rapid Covid-19 tests were being conducted before anyone entered to ensure it remained “a safe community”, Mitarachi said. Erected in a former firing range within view of the sea, the replacement camp is the government’s answer to the humanitarian emergency that exploded last week after fires erupted in the now-gutted holding centre in Moria. A series of blazes, starting on Tuesday, decimated the notoriously overcrowded facility forcing thousands of people into the surrounding countryside. In the chaos that ensued refugees have slept rough, many in makeshift shelters along the side of a stretch of road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital, under heavy police guard. Others had sought refuge in olive groves, churches, supermarket parking lots and even a local cemetery, as authorities and aid groups struggled to bring in water and food. The prospect of being relocated to a new site has been welcomed neither by the refugees, nor locals. Lesbos, which faces Turkey, has long been on the frontline of refugee arrivals. Close to a million displaced Syrians landed on its shores in dinghies and rickety boats at the height of the country’s civil war when Europe’s migrant crisis peaked. For migrants forced to endure lengthy waits for requests to be processed, the Aegean isle is not the promised land envisaged when they embarked on the often perilous journey to Europe. On Sunday, a day after riot police fired teargas at protesters, many refused to enter the new site for fear they would never leave. Mitarachi insisted that those remaining outside would not be transferred to the mainland. “The best solution for them to move on with asylum applications is in the camp,” he said, claiming the centre-right government’s migration policies were “tough but fair”. Fears of a surge in coronavirus cases has, say authorities, made it ever more vital that people living at the camp are found and tested. Prior to the infernos, 35 of Moria’s residents had been diagnosed with the virus, with the Greek migration minister telling reporters “there might be 200 cases … by now”. In Thessaloniki the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said the combination of the pandemic and the migration crisis had made for “an explosive mix” and blamed the fires on “overactive asylum seekers” hoping Moria’s destruction would see them being moved to Athens. But he also voiced optimism that the end of a facility long deplored by human rights groups for its appalling conditions could mark the beginning of a new era for Europe in its often bungled handling of the issue. “I want to believe that this tragedy is a warning bell for all,” he said, adding that, whatever happened, a new camp would be built on Lesbos with the help of Europe. “I’ve requested that the EU be involved in the management of the new centre wherever it is [on the island]. I’d like to see the flag of Greece and Europe flying from masts at it.” Athens has long complained that, aside from funds, it has received little solidarity from the 27-member bloc. “We can’t fail a second time as Europe in handling the migrant crisis,” Mitsotakis said."
2020-04-22T03:40:23Z,Migrants stranded in Queenstown as New Zealand lockdown sparks 'refugee crisis',"Thousands of migrants are stranded in the resort capital of Queenstown, unable to get home and unable to earn a living during the coronavirus lockdown. New Zealand has been in level-four lockdown for a month, meaning no one can leave their homes except to fetch essential supplies, or for a brief respite of exercise. According to the Salvation Army, most migrants in Queenstown are employed in the hospitality and restaurant sectors, and many live in overcrowded conditions, including boarding houses where relationships are under strain. Though wage subsidies have been available for some migrants, depending on their visa and employment conditions, others have been ineligible for government assistance and a record 5,000 people have applied for emergency help, including food and accommodation assistance. With most migrants unable to return to their home countries due to travel and lockdown restrictions, the situation is becoming akin to a “refugee crisis” the Salvation Army said – with about 6,000 people needing urgent help. The Salvation Army has experienced a 600% surge in demand for its services during lockdown. “We’re seeing week on week more extreme and more complicated measures of difficulty. It started off with ‘I have no money for food’, but it’s moving into ‘I have no money for rent, my power, firewood, winter clothing’ and the list just gets longer and longer,” said Lieutenant Andrew Wilson from the Salvation Army. “Many migrants cannot return home, either because their country is in total lockdown or they do not have the resources to pay for flights.” “We’ve had one case where the individual was made redundant two weeks before the level-four lockdown. They had booked flights to return to their home country but their flight was cancelled at the last minute. They are now stuck here with no means of returning home but is still required to pay for rent and outgoings.” Immigration New Zealand is involved in assisting some migrants, and the Salvation Army said it had the ability to “make sure these people don’t go hungry” but larger costs such as getting home, rent and bills were of major concern. Language barriers had also been “a significant issue”, and a number of families now had police and social services involved after lockdown domestic violence incidents, with some families having to be split up for safety reasons. Anu Kaolti from the Migrant Workers Association described the situation as a “powder keg”, and said there was great frustration among migrants that they couldn’t get government help – or get home. “We have been inundated with contact from migrants confused and looking for help,” said Kaloti, adding that many migrants were fired at the beginning of the lockdown. “It’s really dire and desperate circumstances that are beyond anyone’s control. People are still holding it together but the pressures are there, I don’t know how much longer they’ll be able to hold on.” Queenstown was looking at a minimum of a one-year economic downturn, with tourist numbers set to plummet as bans on foreign arrivals are in place. The goal now was to get as many migrants returned to their home countries as possible. Wilson said: “The best-case scenario is for the migrants to return home, or into alternative employment somewhere else in the country, but that’s still a long way off.” Queenstown District Lakes mayor Jim Boult has described the situation as an “unprecedented welfare crisis” and said he expected the 5,000 applications for welfare assistance to rise. “It’s almost too big to comprehend,” Boult told the local paper. “I have been speaking regularly with central government to emphasise the importance of supporting our migrant workers, who will be essential to our ultimate recovery and the future diversification of our economy.” Around the country food banks and welfare services say they are experiencing demand that they would usually only see around Christmas, and many families were surviving on basic foods such as baked beans and porridge."
2020-09-23T17:01:10Z,EU’s migration proposals draw anger on left and leave questions unanswered,"The EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, hopes migration will become just another “normal policy area”, even “boring”. Since more than 1 million refugees arrived in Europe in 2015, migration has been neither “boring” nor easy for the bloc. Leaders have flung accusations at each other, exposing painful divisions. In 2015, Italy’s then prime minister told his fellow leaders they were “time wasters”, who didn’t deserve to call themselves Europeans. Central European countries accused their neighbours of trying to “blackmail” them. The latest proposals are intended to fix a system senior EU officials admit is broken. The Moria camp that sheltered asylum seekers in squalid conditions before it burned to the ground was described as “a stark reminder” that the old system no longer works, by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. While not the “entirely new architecture” billed, the new proposals mark a break with the past. The EU executive has abandoned the idea of mandatory refugee quotas that proved so toxic in 2015, but insists countries cannot do nothing. Governments that refuse refugees and asylum seekers can instead opt to return people denied asylum to their country of origin, an idea described as “return sponsorship”. For the left and some liberals, this compromise is evidence of an authoritarian drift. “The far right has captured EU migration policy,” said Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in’t Veld, although she also praised the commission for its attempt to end years of deadlock, adding that “failure is not an option”. The European People’s party - the centre-right group of Von der Leyen - described the plans as “a good starting point”. Governments on both sides of the asylum debate are holding fire as they digest the plans spread over five draft regulations and other official texts Viktor Orbán’s chief spokesperson did not reveal if the Hungarian government was ready to be a “return sponsor” - brokering deals with Middle Eastern and African countries to take back their nationals – in a statement that put more stress in discouraging migrants to leave their homelands in the first place. However one of Orbán’s MEPs, Balázs Hidvéghi, told BBC Radio 4 that “we are ready to take part in what is called return sponsorship”. If true, that could be a significant step. But Orbán’s government is likely to object to the idea that any migrant not returned to their country of origin after eight months would come to live in the EU member state that had taken charge of their return. On the other side of the migration divide, Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, described the plans as an “important step towards a truly EU migration policy”, but cautioned that “assurance on returns and relocation is needed”. Italy could have problems, as the controversial rule that countries of arrival take default responsibility for migrants is largely intact – although there would be more scope for other EU member states to take over. And there are many open questions. The EU executive wants a monitoring mechanism to investigate widely reported illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at Europe’s borders. But that system would be set up by EU member states, namely, the same countries accused of perpetrating violent abuses. Brussels also wants all new arrivals in the EU to undergo health and security screening at the border within five days – an exacting demand on frontline states, such as Italy and Greece with notoriously slow processes, at a time when the EU migration budget has been slashed. Legislators fear the model will simply be creating “more Morias” with people stuck in closed camps in southern Europe. “This pact risks making the model of Greek hotspots a blueprint for all border countries in the EU,” said Erik Marquardt, a German Green MEP, who has been in Lesbos since the Moria fire. These troubling questions and many more are meant to be resolved in nine months: the commission has called on EU ministers and MEPs to agree the legislation by June 2021. If the timing sounds like a tall order, the retreat on refugee quotas may unlock a compromise. But the EU migration debate is unlikely to become “boring” any time soon."
2020-10-24T17:46:27Z,Government reduces minimum salary for migrants to settle in UK,"The government has quietly reduced the £35,800 minimum salary for migrants to settle in the UK by almost 30%, it has emerged. Migrants on salaries of £20,480 but with enough points under Boris Johnson’s new Australian-style immigration system to qualify for jobs where there is a shortage of workers will also be entitled to settle after six years and become citizens. The rules, which come into force on 1 December, were published on Thursday by the Home Office, with the general threshold lowered to £25,600 as the government tacitly acknowledged the essential contribution that lower paid migrant workers make to the UK. Amnesty International UK said it was troubled by the way immigration rules, including salary thresholds, “have long exaggerated the privilege of people already advantaged by their relative wealth, gender and race”. Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “Sadly, this latest development does not appear to signal any new or firm commitment to encourage equality of opportunity through the UK’s immigration system or to respect the rights and human dignity of all women, men and children regardless of class or colour.” However, Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for tighter immigration control, said the move would reduce the incentive for employers to train British workers. The £35,800 salary threshold was introduced in 2011 by Theresa May when she was home secretary as part of the effort to meet targets on restricting net migration set by David Cameron, which the government was never able to achieve. Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, which identified the change in the 507-page rulebook, said it was “the final nail in the coffin of the net migration target”. Deputy director Rob McNeill told the Daily Telegraph: “They are acknowledging that the bluntest of all the instruments the government used to get to that target of tens of thousands has been kicked into touch.” Before the 2019 general election in December, Johnson reprised the core message of Vote Leave’s 2016 EU referendum campaign and said that EU migrants have been able to “treat the UK as if it’s part of their own country” for too long. He guaranteed that migration would fall under his plans after the UK left the EU as he sought to appeal to undecided Eurosceptic voters in Labour marginals. The Home Office did not comment."
2020-11-29T14:55:09Z,'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration,"In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus. The streets of Arguineguín, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon. Almost 15 years after the “cayuco crisis” of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees. Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguineguín. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguineguín, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309. The people held at the temporary centre – officially for a maximum of 72 hours – are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms. There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents. Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system. Spain’s public ombudsman has called for the Arguineguín camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people’s basic rights. Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were “deplorable”, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mogán, of which Arguineguín is a part. Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island’s capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay. While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will. “This lack of humanity from the government just can’t go on,” she says. “It doesn’t seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.” And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the “cayuco crisis” in 2006. José Segura Clavell, who was the central government’s representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the “humanitarian reception” to which they are entitled. If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. “The EU’s behaviour is a mistake,” he says. “We don’t have a clear common policy.” The lack of a clear, common – and fair – approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU’s new migration and asylum proposals. “We believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,” the four countries said. “The frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.” In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguineguín dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people – including more than 455 unaccompanied children – are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mogán. But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that “Mogán’s solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December” and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere. The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after. “If I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,” Jalloul said on Thursday. “Do you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?” Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry – which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible – says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks. Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October “in search of a future”. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister. But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home. Kamara says the Canaries – “a great place” – remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off. “I was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,” says Kamara. Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with. The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain. For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp “just goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago”. Like many others – not least the regional president of the Canaries – Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, “views island territories as prisons”. But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries. In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into. “Until we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we’re going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,” says Santana. “There will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.”"

The idea that politicians like Boris Johnson and Priti Patel offer “thoughts and prayers” to grieving families while simultaneously limiting routes for asylum is hypocritical and sickening; they have built their political careers by exploiting people’s xenophobia and fear of others.

2020-09-12T16:45:49Z,Greek riot police fire teargas at refugees campaigning to leave Lesbos,"Greek riot police fired teargas at protesting refugees clamouring to leave Lesbos as the situation on the island became more explosive days after devastating fires forced thousands to flee its notorious migrant camp. Tensions mounted as asylum seekers, desperate to make their way to other parts of Europe, watched authorities, including the Greek army, rush to replace the now gutted facility of Moria with a new holding centre. “Freedom, freedom,” demonstrators chanted under the watchful eye of riot police deployed to the Aegean isle from Athens. “We don’t need new camp … we want freedom,” proclaimed some of the crude handwritten placards held aloft by protesters on Saturday. Witnesses reported teargas being fired after younger migrants began lobbing rocks at the police units. A series of overnight blazes starting on Tuesday razed Moria, Europe’s largest refugee camp, decanting close to 13,000 men, women and children into the surrounding countryside. With the exception of 406 lone migrant children who have been flown to the Greek mainland, the former residents have been left to fend for themselves, many making makeshift shelters out of tarps and bamboo reeds along the side of a main road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital. Others have camped in fields, olive groves, churches and even cemeteries. Frustration, the insistence of Greek officials that transferal is out of the question and a growing realisation that any prospect of leaving is diminishing fast have helped create an increasingly toxic atmosphere. The destruction of containers housing the asylum service in Moria has further fuelled a prevailing sense of desperation among refugees. “The thought that they may be here for even longer now, the sight of the replacement camp and being stranded without proper shelter for days has, for many, become the tipping point,” said one aid worker requesting anonymity because she was not authorised to speak. Earlier, Greece’s alternate migration minister, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, told SKAI TV Lesbos was facing a public health emergency, “a triple challenge” that also involves “public order and national security”. He expressed “certainty” that the blazes, which erupted in quick succession and appeared to be coordinated, were the result of arson although as yet no one has been arrested and no concrete evidence offered. Suggestions that rightwing vigilantes may be behind the infernos have also been made. The fires broke out within hours of authorities announcing further lockdown measures in the facility after health officials said they had detected dozens of coronavirus cases in Moria. None of those diagnosed with the virus have yet been found, according to Greek officials. On Saturday a woman and her 20-month-old baby were flown to Athens where they will be hospitalised after testing positive for the virus. They were not among the original group, most of whom were described as asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19. With fears of infection rates increasing, some 200,000 Covid-19 rapid tests were flown into Lesbos on a specially chartered plane on Friday. “There are now real fears among our island’s residents of the virus spreading,” local journalist Yannis Sinanis told the Guardian. Officials were working around-the-clock to erect the new settlement, a collection of 500 tents with the capacity to accommodate six people each. Other asylum seekers are expected to be accommodated in a ferryboat and naval ships. The Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachis, coordinating relief efforts on the island, said every refugee would be tested before entering the temporary site. “We believe that within the day we will start taking people in,” he told reporters in televised comments streamlined by the ministry in Athens. “Already the first families are settled here. Food, water, medical supplies, shelter, safety are the priorities of the day.” Greece, like Lesbos, may be on the frontline of migratory flows from war-torn countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa but the refugee problem was an issue that affected the entire continent he said, thanking EU countries for weighing in with aid in the wake of the fires. “We expect from all our European partners to contribute to an issue that is not Greek,” Mitarachis added. “It is European.”"
2020-12-23T07:15:38Z,'Black book' of thousands of illegal migrant pushbacks presented to EU,"A 1,500-page “black book” documenting hundreds of illegal pushbacks against asylum seekers by authorities on Europe’s external borders was released last week and handed over to the EU commission. Compiled by the watchdog organisation Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN), the Black Book of Pushbacks is a collection of 892 group testimonies, detailing the experiences of 12,654 victims of human rights violations along the Balkan migration route, one of the most gruelling in the recent migrant crisis given the alleged violence of border police officers. Every day, thousands of people, mainly from south Asia, the Middle East and north Africa, attempt to cross the Balkans to reach Europe. It is an arduous journey with virtually no welcoming facilities for migrants, who are forced to spend most of the trip in makeshift camps or in train stations. For years, charities have denounced the abuses, particularly in Croatia, as asylum seekers are systematically beaten, robbed and pushed back. Between January and November 2020, the Danish Refugee Council recorded 15,672 pushbacks from Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina, with more than 60% of these reportedly violent. “This book – which brings together four years of work – points to a gaping hole in accountability for perpetrating authorities, including member states and EU agencies, like Frontex,” Simon Campbell, field coordinator for BVMN, told the Guardian. “The testimonies, committed here to paper, represent a definitive archive of evidence, detailing systematic violations against people on the move, such as breaches of international law on asylum and returns, as well as the prohibition of torture.” More than 15 organisations have contributed to the book, which contains maps, data, photos and other key information and was made in collaboration with the United Left block of the European parliament. Last Friday, Malin Björk, a member of the parliament’s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs and Miguel Urbàn, co-founder of Spanish political party Podemos, presented and handed over the Black Book to the EU commissioner for asylum, Ylva Johansson, in Brussels. Speaking about the launch of the Black Book, German MEP Cornelia Ernst said: “We have been so shocked by endless accounts of merciless, sadistic and degrading violence – reminiscent of brutal dictatorships. The Black Book sheds some much-needed light on this dark chapter of the EU. Our hope is that it will contribute to bringing an end to these crimes and holding the governments that are responsible accountable.” “Although these accusations are met with denial from the perpetrating countries, what we provide within these pages is an analysis of patterns and photo evidence that reveal an ongoing, systematic practice,” said Hope Barker, spokesperson for BVMN. “And these are just the stories that the network has managed to record. The reality is much wider and more far-reaching. “We call for an end to impunity and a renewed commitment to accountability, both of which will work towards ending such brutal human rights violations,” she said. In Bosnia-Herzegovina about 1,200 migrants and asylum-seekers are living in squalid conditions in the Lipa tented camp in Una-Sana canton, a site unsuitable for winter. The International Organization for Migration said it would close the camp as Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to help supply basic services. Thousands of migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon face an impossible choice: fend for themselves in abandoned buildings and squats, or attempt to cross the border into Croatia and the EU – in the hope of escaping the violence of border police."
2020-10-17T17:54:40Z,Refugee supporters hold 'welcome event' for asylum seekers in Kent,"More than 200 people gathered outside a former military barracks housing asylum seekers near Folkestone, to counter rising far-right activity against migrants. Tensions rose around midday as police stopped a dozen far-right protesters from targeting the event by encircling refugee supporters. After the welcome meeting, around 50 counter-protesters marched, with some brandishing St George’s and union flags and chanting racist messages. “The vast majority of people are supportive of migrants, but we don’t always hear their voice, we hear the voice of a very vocal, significant minority,” said Bridget Chapman, from the Kent Refugee Action Network. The area has seen a rise in violent incidents recently and a small number of residents is said to meet by the site every weekend to harass asylum seekers. “There are groups of far-right vigilantes who are claiming to send back migrant boats,” said Richard, a volunteer with Channel Rescue who preferred not to give his surname. Dozens of asylum seekers have been placed in quarantine in one of the redbrick blocks after one person tested positive for coronavirus. It comes after repeated warnings were given over the cramped and unsanitary conditions at the site. The Guardian understands the man who tested positive, an Iranian asylum seeker, is no longer on site and has been taken to hospital. Kay Marsh, who works for the migrant charity Samphire, believes the deteriorating economy is fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment. “The government has managed to convince populations that there is a foreign enemy: you’ve got no money, no job, that’s because of foreigners. And people believe it because they need someone to blame,” she said. “It’s scary to think that your own government has got it out for you.” Inside the barracks, a group of men waved back at the crowd, clapping and shouting: “Thank you!” On one of the building’s doorsteps, a young man was seen holding up a sign reading “we love you”. Among those supporting asylum seekers was Ross Emans, 43, who came with his son. “This is the first time I’ve been involved with a demonstration to support migrants,” he said, holding a sign that read: “Welcome.” “I used Google to translate “welcome” to Arabic. Hopefully, it’s correct! “The migrants have been demonised and dehumanised on the internet by far-right groups. They are treated as if they are just one. Some people refer to them like they are animals when they are human beings and each of them has their own story. It really concerns me and I can understand why they are leaving their countries.” He added that he was getting a DBS check to be able to volunteer with charity Care for Calais. The charity, based in northern France, tweeted out praise for the supporters. “We are so grateful to everyone who attended the welcome event at Folkestone today to lift the spirits of refugees in the barracks and show them that Britain cares,” they said. “Together we made sure the hundreds of people there know that they ARE welcome in this country.” Amani Arab, a 26-year-old woman who came to the UK as a refugee from Syria, was also at the event. “The Folkestone community is very friendly and welcoming. When I came here I felt that everyone wanted you to be part of this community.” So far only one charity, Migrant Help, has been able to enter the site but other organisations are in talks with the authorities to provide services. • This article was amended on 19 and 26 October 2020 to clarify details about the counter-protests."
2020-11-07T08:00:06Z,Streaming: films about the refugee crisis,"The European refugee crisis has inspired so many films in recent years that the subject practically qualifies as a genre in itself, encompassing as broad a spectrum of originality and artistic value as any other. Some documentaries follow a familiar if heart-tugging template; others hit you squarely between the eyes with perspectives you haven’t previously seen or considered. Danish director Eva Mulvad’s documentary Love Child (multiple VOD platforms), falls in the latter category. Its story is a simple one, but the patience and intimacy with which it is told give the film its unusual, building power. Over the course of six years it follows Iranian lovers Sahand and Leila as they flee their homeland and attempt to settle in Turkey while dreaming of a permanent escape to the US. Leila is leaving behind an abusive marriage, having given birth to Sahand’s illegitimate son; execution awaits if they return. In Turkey they’re alive, but everything about their new life – from their boxy, featureless apartment to Sahand’s menial employment – feels temporary. Their asylum-seeking process, meanwhile, stretches on indefinitely, seemingly lost in the vast pile of other, war-ravaged refugees’ applications. With observant, unsentimental clarity, Mulvad tracks the daily burden of living long-term as a refugee – even in conditions others might regard as relatively fortunate, away from the hardship of camps and detention centres. It’s a very different view of the crisis from the more panoramic one offered by Ai Weiwei’s Human Flow (on BFI Player), which frames it less in terms of individual tragedies than as a global population movement, or of Gianfranco Rosi’s thorny, much-celebrated Fire at Sea (on Curzon Home Cinema), which examines the impact of refugees on a small community from inside and out. It’s closer in focus and tenor to Hassan Fazili’s riveting Midnight Traveler (on Amazon), an urgent, first-hand journal of his own family’s escape from Afghanistan, though with a distinctive dynamic: that of a family learning how to live as one for the first time, under the most testing of circumstances. While documentaries have unsurprisingly led the way in putting refugee lives on screen, fiction film-makers are finding increasingly imaginative ways to do so. Recently we’ve had Remi Weekes’s fascinating Netflix horror His House merge the trauma of the Sudanese refugee experience with the terror of a haunted-house movie – to surprisingly sensitive and non-exploitative effect. Like German director Wolfgang Fischer’s brilliant, under-discussed thriller Styx (Google Play), in which a lone female sailor must balance empathy and survival instincts when she encounters an overloaded refugee boat in open water, His House demonstrates how lean, mean genre tropes can heighten the moral urgency of the matter at hand. Other film-makers opt for a stark docudrama approach, as in Jonas Carpignano’s poetic, organically constructed Mediterranea (iTunes), which undertakes a journey from Burkina Faso to Italy with equal parts humanity and hardness. Riskiest of all, perhaps, is the application of whimsy to this toughest of subjects. It’s an approach that British film-maker Ben Sharrock took on his recent debut, Limbo (set to premiere on Mubi in the coming months); but for now, Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismäki owns the sub-genre with his winning unlikely 2017 buddy comedy The Other Side of Hope (Curzon again). With countless individual stories behind the headlines of the crisis, there are any number of ways to tell them. Also new on streaming and DVD Queen of Hearts (Mubi, 18) An audience award-winner at last year’s Sundance festival, this engrossing Danish provocation finally gets a UK release directly to the Mubi platform. What sounds like a premise for salacious soap opera – a wealthy middle-aged lawyer begins an affair with her teenage stepson – is thoughtfully explored in terms of gender standards and taboos, while Trine Dyrholm’s ferocious performance grounds it in tricky emotional reality. Real (Verve, 15) British actor turned film-maker Aki Omoshaybi makes a quietly appealing directorial debut with this gentle character study of an ex-convict and a hard-up working mum embarking on a new relationship in Portsmouth. It’s observed with integrity and care, and if its touch is sometimes a little too soft for its own good, a pair of warm, grounded performances by Pippa Bennett-Warner and Omoshaybi himself keep it, well, real. How You Live Your Story: Selected Works by Kevin Jerome Everson (Second Run) African American artist Jerome Everson’s film-making has been exhibited in galleries across the world, but home viewing hasn’t always been easy. Curated by Everson himself, this nine-hour, two-disc Blu-ray retrospective is an invaluable primer: his raw, beautiful films, dedicated to portraying everyday life in black communities, are supplemented with an image booklet of equally striking photography. Breathless (StudioCanal, PG) Given a gleaming 4K restoration for its 60th anniversary, Jean-Luc Godard’s pace-setting Nouvelle Vague landmark looks sharper and younger than most of us would seven decades in: however much parodied and imitated, its twitchy, sexy reanimation of a bare-bones crime-film formula has held on to its cool. For true obsessives, the ultra-tricked-out special edition includes a vinyl soundtrack."
2020-09-13T05:09:19Z,The Observer view on the EU's refugee crisis | Observer editorial,"Scenes of devastation and desperation at the burnt-out refugee camp at Moria, on the Greek island of Lesbos, are powerful reminders that Europe’s migrant crisis never really ended. The response of EU member states and close neighbours such as Britain has, with some exceptions, once again been shamefully inadequate. The fact that these failures are familiar does not lessen the immediate, dreadful human impact of this latest tragedy, nor does it obviate the urgent need to find lasting solutions. If fire had not destroyed most of the Moria camp last week, leaving up to 13,000 people without food, water and shelter, it’s a safe bet most of Europe would have continued to turn a blind eye to what was already a scandal on its doorstep. Repeated pleas by local people and the Greek government for more EU support and solidarity would have continued to be ignored. Pictures of small children and bereft families, deprived of all they own, squatting by the roadside or in filthy doorways, have pricked consciences – at least for now. Charities hope the disaster will prove a permanent turning point. “The Moria camp was already unfit for humans before the fire, with four times as many people than it was built for,” said Francesco Rocca, head of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. “Enough is enough. Now is the time to show some humanity and move these people to a healthy, safe and humane place. There are 4,000 children in Moria and no child should have to endure this.” Germany has again taken the lead in offering help, as it did during the 2015 refugee crisis. Plans have been made to transfer 400 unaccompanied minors to 10 European countries, with about 150 going to Germany. The EU commission said about 1,600 people would be given temporary shelter aboard a ferry. After visiting the area, commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas promised a larger, more modern facility would be built at the same location. These are mere stop-gap measures and many locals and migrants oppose replacing the destroyed camp at all. But, as in the past, political obstacles at the national level are preventing a more comprehensive response. Several German regions and cities have offered to take in refugees. In Berlin, about 3,000 people took to the streets last week to demand a more generous attitude. “We have room!” they shouted. Moria was a “camp of shame”. Yet Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, a critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s now-revoked 2015 open-door policy, said the focus should be on providing “help on the ground”. Such caution reflects continuing Europe-wide concern about a resurgence of the anti-immigrant sentiment that has boosted far-right populist and ultra-nationalist groups. It also reflects a divided EU’s repeated failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy based on shared responsibility, though it says new proposals are imminent. Britain’s reaction to Moria is even more deeply unsatisfactory. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has yet to respond to a letter from the Labour peer Lord Dubs urging admission of unaccompanied children. “The government cannot keep dodging the issue,” he wrote. But it seems determined to try. When the Médecins Sans Frontières charity asked Patel in March to accept more children from Moria and other overcrowded Greek camps threatened by Covid-19, she did not deign to reply. Quite how Boris Johnson hopes to establish a leading role for “global Britain” when it ducks its share of responsibility for tackling international migration, one of the great global problems of the day, is hard to fathom. Patel pretends to care about the safety of relatively small numbers of migrants crossing the Channel, over which rightwing bigots and xenophobes have kicked up an enormous fuss. Yet she and other ministers have nothing to say about the catastrophe in Moria and no help to offer. How small minded. How demeaning. How very un-British."
2020-11-24T15:28:08Z,Rescuers recover migrants' wedding rings lost at sea,"On 9 November, a migrant rescue boat came across a red backpack floating in the Mediterranean alongside other remains from a shipwreck that took place weeks before. The rucksack, covered with sea snails and reeking of petrol, contained two wedding rings, inscribed with the names Ahmed and Doudou. “We thought it was proof of yet another love story that ended up at the bottom of the sea,” said Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, who recovered the personal items. “Unfortunately we find many of these. Most of the time suitcases and bags, floating in the sea, are nothing more than symbols of yet another journey that began in Libya and ended in tragedy.” Nevertheless, as it always does, Open Arms activated a procedure to try to trace the owners of the belongings by sharing the photos on their social channels and among their networks of contacts. “What happened next was exciting,” Gatti said. Thanks to an article published in the newspaper La Repubblica that carried photos of the rings, the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) discovered they belonged to a newlywed Algerian couple, Ahmed, 25, and Doudou, 20. The couple, who were staying at a reception centre in Sicily, were among 15 survivors of a shipwreck that took place off the coast of the island of Lampedusa on 21 October in which five people died. “As soon as they showed us the photos of the rings, I couldn’t believe it,” Ahmed said in a message passed on by MSF. ‘‘We had lost everything and now the few things we set out with on the journey have been found. It’s incredible. “The rings were in the backpack because they had broken and we wanted to have them repaired once we arrived in Europe,” Ahmed added. ‘’None of my travel companions managed to recover anything. We are very happy but we are still mourning our friends who didn’t make it.” Ahmed and Doudou told aid workers that they had left Zawiya in Libya on a small wooden boat with 20 other people on 19 October. Forty-eight hours into the crossing, however, their petrol ran out and the boat was left at the mercy of the sea, with weather conditions starting to deteriorate. Ester Russo, a psychologist at MSF who spoke to the couple, said survivors from the shipwreck had told of a big wave that hit about 60km off Lampedusa. “The 15 people onboard were saved by a Sicilian fishing boat,” Russo said. “Five people died, including a two-year-old girl. Her mother was shocked. Time stopped for her when she no longer saw her daughter. On that same trip a nine-year-old child lost his mother and is now alone in Italy.” Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for MSF in Sicily, said Doudou was trying to recover from the trauma of the journey. “She is still in shock from what happened,” Rousan said. “She saw five travel companions die in front of her eyes, including a child. But both she and Ahmed are fine.” The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship. which is off the coast of Sicily. “We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,” said Gatti. “We can’t wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too. It’s not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.”"
2020-09-10T17:29:39Z,Covid-19 fears on Lesbos as thousands of refugees flee huge fires,"Greek authorities on Lesbos are racing to find refugees who had tested positive for Covid-19 before a series of devastating fires forced thousands to flee Europe’s biggest migrant camp. Health officials have rushed 19,000 test kits to the north-eastern Aegean island amid fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. “It’s a very dangerous, very explosive situation,” Efstratios Tzimis, Mytilene’s deputy mayor, told the Guardian. “And it’s making all of us crazed. On the one hand there’s coronavirus, on the other thousands of desperate, hungry people.” Only eight of the more than three dozen refugees diagnosed with the virus have been found. Authorities say they have been quarantined in a special area with close family members. Extra police units were dispatched to the island on Thursday, reinforcing a cordon around Moria, whose charred remains were still smouldering when new fires erupted in and around the facility more than 24 hours after the main blaze began. Men, women and children deprived of shelter slept on the sides of roads, in olive groves and even a graveyard after the fires that began late on Tuesday. Many awoke on Thursday huddled in sheets and blankets that were their only protection against gale-force winds. Hopes of some being able to return to the small section of the hilltop camp that survived the inferno were crushed by a second wave of fire. In the early morning light, former residents could be seen in the apocalyptic landscape desperately foraging for belongings. Less than 48 hours after the first blaze, the notoriously overcrowded facility – home to 13,000 people at the beginning of the week – was reduced to little more than a heap of mangled steel and melted tent tarpaulin. Greek officials, who have declared a state of emergency on Lesbos, say the fires were deliberately started by asylum seekers reacting to quarantine measures after Covid-19 infections were detected. Moria, like other refugee camps in Greece, has been in lockdown since the start of the pandemic in March. The confinement has fuelled anger and hostility among people who, before the pandemic, had been waiting, often for years, for answers to asylum requests. “Some people do not respect the country that is hosting them,” Stelios Petas, a government spokesman, told reporters in Athens. “They believed that if they set fire to Moria, they’d be able to leave the island indiscriminately,” he added, saying only unaccompanied minors would be removed from Lesbos. “We tell them they did not understand. They will not leave because of the fire.” In an EU-funded operation a third chartered plane carrying the last of 406 children hosted at the holding centre flew from Mytilene’s international airport to northern Greece on Thursday morning. From there they are expected to continue their journeys to EU countries that have promised to take them in. Relief efforts have focused on the government and UN refugee agency sending in thousands of tents in addition to a ferryboat and two naval ships to temporarily accommodate people. The centre-right government faces staunch opposition from local residents tired of their island being on the frontline of migratory flows from the war-torn Middle East, Africa and Asia. In the summer of 2015, at the height of Syria’s civil war, close to 1 million refugees crossed the sea from Turkey to Europe via Lesbos. A former army barracks originally designed to host fewer than 3,000 people, Moria was eight times over capacity at the beginning of the year. Human rights groups have criticised the facility, and its dire living conditions, as the wretched face of Europe’s bungled migration policies and inability to humanely manage refugees. Many have called it a stain on the conscience of the continent. On Thursday, as the army cleaned up the wreckage with bulldozers and diggers, infuriated villagers set up roadblocks to prevent them accessing the camp. “‘[The refugees] have to go somewhere else,” said Tzimis, the deputy mayor. “We understand their plight, but people here are also exhausted. Either they are taken to an uninhabited island or, if that can’t happen, Europe should take them in.” Greece’s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, a steadfast supporter of open-air island camps such as Moria being replaced by smaller, “closed” detention centres, called for calm. The prospect of the centres has however been criticised by aid groups and islanders, who fear that the camps will become permanent fixtures. “Everyone has to be realistic,” Mitarachi told Skai TV, saying the government’s priority was to have “no homeless family” by the evening. “At this moment we are up against two fronts. The one is migrants who are resorting to blackmail to leave, the other local leaders who are not displaying the necessary responsibility at such a difficult [time].”"
2020-11-10T16:28:53Z,"Canary Islands appeal for help as 2,200 migrants arrive over weekend","The president of the Canary Islands has appealed for urgent help from the Spanish government and the EU after around 2,200 migrants arrived on the archipelago over the weekend, putting further strain on its already massively overstretched reception resources. Ángel Víctor Torres said the Canaries’ existing infrastructure could not cope with the number of people arriving, as the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to Europe attracted more refugees and migrants. “It’s not hard to sum up,” Torres said this week. “The flow of arrivals still greatly exceeds the reception capacity. They’re absorbed, they’re distributed and they’re relocated, but the flow of arrivals is still much higher than the reception response.” The regional president pointed out that 2,188 people had reached the islands over the weekend and that they were being housed in makeshift camps on the docks at Arguineguín on Gran Canaria. Torres said the Canaries could not be used as “prison islands” where people were held indefinitely, when there was far more reception space available in mainland Spain. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 11,000 people have arrived in the Canaries by sea so far this year, half of them in October alone, while 414 are feared to have died in the attempt. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. This year’s figures, however, are well down on 2006, when 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries by sea. Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and the EU’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, visited the islands last week. At a press conference on Friday, Johansson paid tribute to the “tremendous efforts” of the central and regional governments in managing the situation in such difficult times. But Torres asked for help that went beyond words, saying: “We’re not in a planning phase, we’re in a reaction phase.” He said the Covid-19 pandemic was making things ever harder, called for urgent action to dismantle the Arguineguín camp and appealed for the EU to make good on the “shared European commitment” to managing migration. Spain’s interior ministry, meanwhile, has been criticised for refusing to allow journalists to document the plight of those stuck on the Arguineguín docks. Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the Canaries over the weekend and described the conditions on the docks as “pretty awful”. She said the Spanish authorities had been slow to act, even after it became clear that the Atlantic route was opening up again. “The numbers surged and all of a sudden, it’s emergency mode and that’s when things get really bad,” she said. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland. Those are two very clear solutions.” Sunderland said she had spoken to some women on the docks who had been in the hot, crowded camp for more than two weeks. The longer the migrants and refugees stayed in the area, she said, the worse things would get. “They need to transfer people to the mainland,” she said. “That would alleviate the extreme pressure on the islands right now, which is a recipe for disaster.” Sunderland recognised that Spain, like Italy, had been badly affected by the pandemic, but said it needed to overhaul its “shortsighted and poor” policymaking. “This is a challenge – but it’s not something that Spain can’t handle in a humane way,” she said. “Of course it can; it’s just a lack of will and coordination and a bit of money.” In February, Spain’s migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. But the secretary of state for migration, Hana Jalloul, said the numbers of people arriving were overwhelming the islands’ reception resources. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. At least 140 people died last month after a boat carrying 200 people caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year."
2020-09-23T16:05:59Z,EU proposes to ditch refugee quotas for member states,"The European commission is abandoning the idea of mandatory refugee quotas, as it revives an attempt to change Europe’s asylum and migration rules after more than four years of deadlock. The long-awaited migration proposals, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, would allow EU member states to choose whether to accept refugees, or take charge of returning those denied asylum to their home countries. As a sweetener to take in refugees, or asylum seekers rescued in the Mediterranean Sea, countries would be offered €10,000 (£9,192) for each adult, funded from the EU budget. But in a break with the past, no country would be obliged to offer shelter to anyone. This “solidarity à la carte” is intended to break the stalemate that has reigned since 2015, when the EU forced through mandatory refugee quotas at the height of the migration crisis via a qualified-majority vote. Hungary, later joined by Poland, refused to take in any refugees. The two countries went on to join a blocking coalition that stymied a 2016 attempt at reform based on mandatory payments for those countries who refused to take in asylum seekers. While the latest changes are designed to ease pressure on frontline states, Italy, Greece and Spain are likely to be disappointed they retain default responsibility for managing asylum claims. The European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, said the emphasis on returns reflected the changed reality since 2015. “We need to deal with the real situation and not deal with the situation that people have in their heads,” she told a group of reporters. “Most [arrivals] are not refugees: two-thirds of irregular arrivals will have a negative decision.” In 2019, 491,200 people were ordered to leave the EU, but only 29% were returned to their country of origin. Johansson said “100% returns is maybe not doable” but there was “significant room for improvement here”. While improving returns has been a goal of EU policy for years, the commission hopes to inject impetus by appointing a returns coordinator to help member states. One NGO accused Brussels of giving in to anti-migration governments. “The commission has bowed to pressure from EU governments whose only objective is to decrease the number of people granted protection in Europe,” said Marissa Ryan, the head of Oxfam’s EU office. Johansson, the Swedish commissioner, hopes taking charge of returns will be an attractive option for EU governments that have no wish to shelter asylum seekers. She insisted the absence of historical links with Middle East and African countries should not be a bar to taking up “return sponsorship”. Her own country had “invested a lot in Morocco and Afghanistan” in order to encourage these governments to take back their citizens, she said. But governments will become responsible for any migrants they fail to return. Governments who shun relocation and returns could also opt to spend money on other measures, for example funding reception centres in frontline states such as Greece. But the commission would be able to overrule these gestures, if not enough countries came forward to do the heavy lifting on relocation and returns. “Everybody has to do their share of the solidarity,” Johansson said. The commission is also promising faster processes: it wants to introduce a rule that all arrivals should have health and security checks completed within five days. Despite a promised pilot programme in Greece, it remains unclear whether the EU has the resources to speed up notoriously slow procedures in Greece and Italy. EU leaders cut migration and border control spending by €8.5bn or 27%, when they struck a deal on the bloc’s next seven-year budget in July. The proposals will certainly be changed in the horse trading between EU lawmakers in the 27 member states and the European parliament, and agreement is far from certain. Germany, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said it aimed to reach agreement on the principles by the end of the year, while the commission wants the legislation wrapped up by June 2021. German interior minister Horst Seehofer described the plans as a “good basis for discussion” with member states. “There is currently no functioning European migration policy,” he added. “Europe’s fate will be determined by its migration policy.” Greece gave a positive reaction, with government spokesman Stelios Patsos tweeting that the proposal meant stronger border control and a “fair” division between responsibility and solidarity. Italy and Hungary – both crucial for an agreement – gave a more guarded response. More than five years after Angela Merkel opened Germany’s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees, migration continues to divide the EU, although arrivals are far lower. Around 150,000 irregular migrants arrived in the EU in 2018, the lowest level in five years, and only a fraction of the 2.4 million who came to live in the EU27 from the rest of the world in the same period. The appalling conditions facing some asylum seekers, encapsulated by the burnt-down Moria camp, is seen as testimony to the EU’s failure. On the eve of the new proposals, the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration warned that the EU’s current policy was “unworkable, untenable and often carries devastating human consequences”. Following reports of illegal pushbacks in the Mediterranean Sea and at land borders, the commission wants to introduce a monitoring mechanism to investigate abuses. “To be frank, I can’t act on these reports, because I have no possibility to investigate,” Johansson said. However the commission will be relying on EU member states – supported by the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency – to set up monitoring. That means the same governments accused of abusive policies and violent pushbacks will be responsible for assessing whether they are taking place."
2020-12-08T00:01:54Z,"End housing of asylum seekers in old army barracks, UK ministers urged","More than 60 community organisations working with migrants held in detention and refugees have urged ministers to consider alternative accommodation to the former army barracks currently being used to house asylum seekers following damning reports on conditions at the sites. Napier barracks in Kent and Penally barracks in Pembrokeshire, which between them hold more than 600 men, were handed over from the Ministry of Defence to the Home Office in September to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers. The Home Office has been hit by a raft of reports alleging poor access to healthcare, denial of access to lawyers, overbearing use of confidentiality agreements and concerns over safety and privacy at the sites. There has been at least one confirmed suicide attempt at one of the barracks. In a letter to the immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, the organisations, led by the Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (Avid), highlight parallels between the barracks and the UK’s system of indefinite immigration detention and calls for community-based alternatives to be sought. Other signatories include Refugee Action, Detention Action, Care4Calais, Migrant Rights Network, Kent Refugee Action Network (Kran), Doctors of the World UK, Choose Love/Help Refugees, Liberty, Jesuit Refugee Service UK and Samphire. Ali McGinley, the director of Avid, said: “There is no shortage of evidence that the UK’s system of immigration detention does very little other than cause long lasting damage: to the individuals held, but also to their families and communities. We’ve seen this first hand over many years. Choosing to ignore this by replicating the worst injustices of this system in the barracks accommodation is irresponsible, dangerous and puts many more people at risk.” The letter to Philp outlines how the isolated locations of the barracks have left residents exposed to abuse by far-right activists, who have been able to easily locate the former MoD sites. The Home Office has said the sites are temporary contingency accommodation for asylum seekers who will eventually be moved to dispersed accommodation such as houses or flats while their claims are considered. It said it intended to use the sites for a year. Official figures showed that in September, 76% of people awaiting a decision on their asylum claim had been waiting for more than six months, up from 58% in September 2019. The letter states there is growing evidence that managing people’s cases while they remain in the community with access to support is both less expensive and more effective. Given the significant backlog in processing asylum applications, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, it is time to consider alternatives, the letter says. Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “We have serious concerns about the mental and physical health of often traumatised people forced to live behind barbed wire and high fences so close to each other in the middle of a pandemic. People need access to medical and legal support that simply cannot be provided in those conditions. “Home Office ministers are failing in their duty of care to people in the asylum system. It must urgently work with providers to find more suitable accommodation in a wider range of areas across the country.” The Home Office has been approached for comment."
2020-12-22T06:30:08Z,'A mental health emergency': no end to trauma for refugees on Lesbos,"Nadia hasn’t slept. The mother of five spent last night trying to soothe her seven-year-old son, Matin, who is autistic, while heavy rain fell on the family’s tent. He was crying and asking for the noise to stop. “I tried to explain to him that the rain is not in our control,” she says, “but in these moments, you can’t reach him any more.” The family, originally from Parwan province in Afghanistan, are living in the new refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos that was built in three days, after the fire that razed to the ground parts of the infamous Moria camp. Nadia, 38, washes Matin, who has recently recovered from scabies, using water from a plastic bottle. She says she has seen a steady deterioration in his behaviour and sleeping. “We can’t sleep any more,” she says. “I need Matin to get into a warm place. This is my only wish.” A report released last week by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), which includes testimonies from 904 participants of IRC health programmes from camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos, showed that after the first lockdown in March there was a 71% increase in the number of people experiencing psychotic symptoms, and a 66% increase in self-harm. Anna Schlegel, who started Medical Volunteers International’s programme working with children on Lesbos, says emotional instability is common among the children they treat. “They will get either very aggressive or sad from one minute to the next. Among our 32 child patients, issues also include bedwetting, stuttering and sleepwalking.” “Children [have] also started using self-harm to get rid of tension and the overwhelming emotions they face through the retraumatisation,” says Schlegel, adding that the Moria fire on 8 September still weighed heavily on some children. “One boy we have in our group was always focused on fire. If he’d see a building, he would focus on it and ask how it would look if it was burning down.” “We have not seen a mental health care emergency like this one, even in Moria,” says Thanasis Chirvatidis, a child psychologist with Médecins Sans Frontières on Lesbos who said the parents needed to be stabilised psychologically first. “If a child sees his parents giving up or being afraid, the ‘scaffolding’ breaks away from them too,” says Chirvatidis, adding that children do not have the same mechanisms as adults to express their fears. “Most of it surfaces during sleep.” In 2020 MSF has treated 49 children on Lesbos with thoughts of suicide or for suicide attempts. The current demand for MSF’s services is more than the organisation can meet and there is a lengthy waiting list for the paediatric clinic and the clinic for victims of torture and sexual violence. Rainfall has left parts of the camp waterlogged and tents have been flooded on more than one occasion. Human rights organisations have raised concerns about substandard living conditions for inhabitants of the camp, dubbed “Moria 2.0” by many on the ground. Thirty-six hot water showers have just been installed but many of the 7,300 residents still shower using buckets or water bottles. Lockdown restrictions mean that residents are only allowed to leave once a week to visit the supermarket, a lawyer or the pharmacy. Exits are monitored and fines given out for residents not wearing masks. “Many children are also afraid of the police,” says Chirvatidis, “they are not perceived as protectors but mainly as punishers.” Petra Molnar, from the Migration and Technology Monitor, says security measures are having an impact on people’s mental health. “We are seeing the rise of surveillance technologies like drones patrolling the skies, and the increased use of closed and controlled facilities like the new camp on Lesbos,” she says. “This type of omnipresent surveillance and toxic ongoing stress has long-term mental health repercussions, especially for children.” Lesbos is not the only Aegean island dealing with a growing mental health crisis. Samos has just over 3,600 people living on an area of land designed for 648. The island was rocked by an earthquake in October, as well as by recent fires in the camp, where some residents have lost all their documents or belongings. “Each time something like this happens, it just kind of pushes them over the edge,” says Lindsay Solera-Deuchar, an MSF psychiatrist who has worked on Samos for nearly two months. In November, 60% of new arrivals at their clinic expressed suicidal thoughts, she says. “It really feels like sometimes we’re fighting a losing battle.” Guilia Cicoli, from the Mazi youth centre on Samos, said she had heard some students express suicidal thoughts such as, “I don’t want to live any more”, and “I don’t know when this will end.” Children make up around a quarter of the population of the camp on Samos, which is perched on a hill, overlooking the town of Vathy. Most people sleep outside the camp boundaries, where rats, scabies and bed bugs are a part of daily life. “[People] lucky enough to be housed in a container often don’t have hot water, the floor is destroyed, windows or doors are missing and the containers overcrowded,” says Cicoli. During a visit to Lesbos last week the Greek migration minister Notis Mitarakis said the new temporary camp was “in a very good state of security and order”, and “did not compare to Moria”. While EU member states debate the resettlement of refugees from the Aegean islands, more than 14,500 people are facing another winter in island refugee camps. Nadia will continue to leave the camp once a week to take her son to his medical appointments, packing a colouring book to keep him busy and wearing three jackets to stay warm.

2020-11-12T07:15:01Z,Dozens of Sudanese migrants held in Cairo after protests,"Dozens of Sudanese refugees and migrants have been arrested after protests over the murder of a young boy in Cairo. Amnesty International said about 70 people, including children, were arrested by Egyptian security forces after what it said were two peaceful protests on 29 October. Amid reports of rising xenophobia and violence towards refugees in Egypt, the demonstrations were sparked by the stabbing of Sudanese 12 year-old Mohamed Hassan. An Egyptian man has been arrested over the killing. The rights group said security forces dispersed the protests using teargas and water cannon and that some of those arrested were beaten in police custody. The majority of the detainees were released the next day, but 10 men are still being held by the Egyptian intelligence services without access to lawyers. A cousin of one of the detainees said: “We are really concerned about them. We don’t know what’s going to happen for them.” Amnesty said that on 2 November, Egyptian security forces in plainclothes raided the homes and workplaces of at least five Sudanese activists. Others received phone calls, telling them they faced deportion. Several activists have now gone into hiding. The Public Prosecution Office has dismissed claims of human rights violations against foreign nationals in Egypt. According to a source working with refugees in Cairo, many opponents of the Sudanese government – particularly those from Darfur and the Nuba mountains – living in Egypt have been imprisoned, tortured and handed over to the Sudanese security forces by Egypt. According to reports on some Arabic websites, Egypt had in return asked Sudan to deport dozens of Muslim Brotherhood leaders to Cairo. “The Sudanese people who come from African backgrounds such as Nuba, Fur, Zagawa are faced with particular discrimination in Egypt,” said the source. “They are visibly black. While the experience in Egypt of Sudanese who come from Arab backgrounds is relatively better.” Almost 50,000 Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers currently live in Egypt, according to the UN. A woman from Darfur who was detained after a protest, said living conditions in Egypt were tough. “It’s so difficult being a refugee in Egypt. It’s three times harder than what we left behind in Darfur. Yes there were killings and rapes in Sudan, but here is worse. “Egypt looks safe from outside, but it’s so bad from inside,” said the 42-year-old. Of her time in jail she said: “What have we done to deserve all that? They threatened us that we will not see the sun again.” Elena Habersky, a project manager at Refugee Entitlements in Egypt, said the killing of Mohamed Hassan “struck a nerve” with the Sudanese refugee community. “His death was a straw that broke the camel’s back with regard to violence faced by Sudanese refugees … It was only logical that protests would ensue from the community to demand justice for the death of young Mohamed, but to also bring to light the difficulties faced, not only by the Sudanese refugee community, but by many African refugees in general.”"
2020-12-13T08:00:01Z,UK ‘reneges on vow to reunite child refugees with families’,"Unaccompanied children in France are being told by the French authorities that they should give up hope of being reunited with family in the UK after the Home Office failed to offer the help it had promised. With the deadline to enter the UK legally and safely under the EU’s family reunification rules due to expire at the end of the year, the Home Office is accused of reneging on its vow to help unaccompanied children reunite with family in the UK. A year ago, Boris Johnson told parliament that he was “absolutely committed to ensuring that this country will continue to receive unaccompanied children” after Britain left the EU. The Home Office had pledged to reunite families who applied before the 31 December deadline, with charities also saying they received assurances that the UK would continue to reunite families next year for cases accepted before the Brexit transition period ended. However, sources have now revealed that “no proper arrangements” were put in place by the UK for transfers under the family reunification Dublin agreement. Last week, French authorities, following discussions with the country’s interior ministry, began telling children and families that they could not apply to reunite with family in the UK. The move could also affect minors in refugee camps in Greece who are eligible for family reunion, forcing them to risk dangerous journeys in order to reach family in the UK. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the charity Safe Passage International, which helps with the transfer of unaccompanied minors to the UK, said: “Unaccompanied child refugees in Europe have been left with nothing more than broken promises and fading hopes of reuniting with family in the UK. It is devastating that children desperate to reunite with their family have been turned away because of government inaction and a failure in international cooperation.” So far, Safe Passage is aware of two families who have been told by French authorities that they could not apply for family reunification, including a Kuwaiti Bidoon woman with three children who is hoping to reunite with her husband in the UK. In addition, the charity knows of 20 cases of unaccompanied children and five families who are eligible to be transferred to the UK but will be refused unless the situation changes. Cases identified in northern France and Paris include 16 unaccompanied children from Afghanistan who are seeking to join family in the UK. One is a child hoping to join his brother, who originally fled the Taliban. In another case an Ethopian husband with two children is hoping to be reunited with his wife. Safe Passage is now urging the UK government to take immediate action to resolve the issue and to cooperate with France and the EU to help reunite families. A Home Office spokesperson said: “These claims are completely inaccurate. We are committed to continuing to process all family reunion cases, under the Dublin regulation, that entered the system before the end of the transition period. All EU member states can continue to make requests to the UK on the basis of family reunion and we will continue to assess and process these requests. “We have to help more people directly from the affected regions and that is exactly what we are planning with our new firm and fair asylum system, which will welcome people through safe and legal routes.”"
2020-10-30T15:44:29Z,Refugee agencies call for action on people smuggling after 140 die in shipwreck,"UN refugee and migration agencies have called for renewed efforts to tackle people-smuggling and trafficking gangs, and to protect those they exploit, after at least 140 people died off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year. The deaths, which followed four shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean last week and another in the Channel, come amid a huge rise in the number of migrants and refugees using the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to the Canary Islands. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), a vessel carrying 200 people left the Senegalese coastal town of Mbour last Saturday, bound for the Canary Islands. A few hours into the journey, the boat caught fire and capsized near Saint-Louis on Senegal’s north-west coast. Fifty-nine people were rescued by nearby fishing vessels and the Senegalese and Spanish navies, and the bodies of 20 others were recovered. A survivor of the wreck said it had been impossible to count the number of passengers on the boat, a narrow craft called a pirogue more usually used for fishing. Many were from Saint-Louis, where entire streets were plunged into mourning by the tragedy. Rescued by Spanish coastguards before being handed over to Senegalese authorities, the 20-year-old told local media that “when it blew up, it was everyone for themselves to escape and survive”. He described catching hold of a plastic jerry can, throwing it into the water and then diving in after it. “It was a fight for the jerry cans,” he said. “I spent three hours hanging on to it. When the boat exploded I saw people, possibly dead, either side of me, but I was only thinking about saving myself.” The incident on Saturday was followed by another early on Monday in which a Senegalese navy vessel struck a boat filled with migrants when it tried to escape a patrol. Authorities said they were able to save “only 39” people. More are presumed to have drowned. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the Atlantic route was growing in popularity once again because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. “This is a trend that’s going to continue – especially given the current context,” said María Jesús Vega, a spokeswoman for UNHCR Spain. “We need to do a lot more to fight these merciless mafias, who are already reorganising themselves to play with people’s lives.” Even before reaching an overcrowded boat, said Vega, many people were tortured and abused by the gangs. “Then there’s the crossing itself, which is very long and dangerous and which can take days or even weeks. This is the deadliest route. Some of these boats are fully packed with people – 100, 200 per boat – so people are really risking their lives all over again.” Vega said that unlike the crisis in 2006, when about 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries, NGOs were seeing “mixed flows”, with more refugees braving the Atlantic route along with migrants. Interviews with 130 men and women in August revealed that many were fleeing conflict or indiscriminate violence in the Sahel region, while others said their already precarious situation had been worsened by the pandemic. “The proportions vary, but more than 30% of these people are from Mali. There are also a lot of Moroccans and as well as people from Ivory Coast, Senegal and Guinea,” said Vega. “The majority are men, but 20% are women and 12% are children. There wasn’t a significant number of women in the 2006 crisis.” Vega said that while the number of arrivals, compounded by the pandemic, was putting the Canaries’ reception infrastructure under huge strain, “a good, coordinated response” was required from the local, regional and central governments. She said interpreters and legal advisers needed to be on hand to identify, help and protect people who may be entitled to asylum and who could be at risk if returned. Bakary Doumbia, IOM’s Senegal mission chief, also called for a united front to tackle the people smugglers and traffickers. “We call for unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth,” he said. “It is also important that we advocate for enhanced legal channels to undermine the traffickers’ business model and prevent loss of life.” IOM said that in September alone, 14 boats carrying a total of 663 migrants left Senegal for the Canary Islands. More than a quarter of the departures were reported to have experienced an incident or shipwreck. This week, the Senegalese government said it was also concerned by the number of people trying to reach Europe by sea. “The government has noted with regret the resurgence of clandestine emigration by sea,” it said in a statement, adding that navy patrols had rescued 388 people at sea between 7 and 23 October. According to IOM figures, 11,006 people have arrived in the Canaries since January this year, with 4,925 arrivals in October alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. An estimated 414 people have died trying to reach the Canaries so far this year – almost double the 210 deaths recorded in 2019. In an interview with the Guardian this week, Spain’s secretary of state for migration said the issue required a coordinated international response. “It’s clear that everyone realises that we won’t be able to deal with this phenomenon unless we work in countries of origin,” said Hana Jalloul. “But we also need to focus on the mafias who abuse these people and push a dream that ends in death at sea.”"
2020-11-01T10:00:17Z,Migrants and my own modest proposal | Stewart Lee,"In August, a television producer asked me to contribute to a forthcoming documentary about the 18th-century satirist Jonathan Swift. Swift is best known for writing the children’s story Gulliver’s Travels, which is about a man who keeps going all different sizes and riding around on mice. Swift failed to use the then fashionable travelogue format to address the moral and philosophical concerns of the day in favour of a series of childish Grandpa in My Pocket-style adventures that David Walliam could have written, the idiot. I am not an expert on Swift, but the producer said some of my standup routines are like his essays, though she conceded that she didn’t think these columns were as good as my live stuff. I explained that I saw the columns as being written by an alternative version of myself, one who doubted that he had the talent, intelligence or social standing to write for a posh newspaper, and was compensating for his nest-cuckoo paranoia by overstating his political and intellectual qualifications. “Which version of you is writing this paragraph that we are both in now then?”, she asked over her clipboard at a socially distanced meeting on Tuesday. Realising I didn’t have a satisfactory answer, I pretended to be choking on a Frazzle and lay down on the floor. Normally I resist appearing on anything that anyone will see, as it only encourages rightwing commentators to cynically traduce you online for things you obviously haven’t done, raising your blood pressure and compromising your children’s relationships with their friends. But there was a fee for agreeing that I was the new Jonathan Swift, an offer hardly as reputationally damaging to a champagne Corbynista as appearing on Have I Got News for You. As I haven’t really worked since March, and as the boy needs a new bike and the cat needs an endoscopy, I succumbed, already regretting the loss of the Strictly Come Dancing slot I had recklessly ceded to Bill Bailey earlier in the year, under medical advice admittedly. In preparation, I reimmersed myself in the works of Jonathan Swift, reading from the same copy of Martin Price’s The Restoration and the 18th Century that the lady my gran did cleaning for in the 80s had bought for me when I went to university 34 years ago, subsidising the punishingly expensive required book list. But we still got grants! Back then, politicians regarded knowledge as valuable in itself, rather than as a commodity that could only be judged in terms of its financial impact. Swift’s eugenics satire A Modest Proposal, I suddenly realised, applied the same now fashionable rationale to human flesh itself, proposing eating poor Irish infants as an economic solution to their burden on society. Nothing had changed. Under the spell of Swift, on 12 October, I tried to write the coming Sunday’s column by transposing his satirical argument for eating the Irish poor on to the argument by Priti Patel’s Home Office in favour of netting channel migrants. I tried to use the same mixture of fake sympathy and brutal logic that Swift deploys to convince his readers of the expediency of infant cannibalism, as you may see: “God provided the Channel to divide us from our fair neighbour France, the sadly suppurating wound from whose festering Northernmost ports oozes the tragic pus of this vile but intrepid tide of human filth, optimism and vigour. I do therefore further humbly offer it to public consideration, given that any netted migrants must be either imprisoned upon Southern Atlantic islands, or in rotting prison hulks off Portsmouth, might not a gentleman be tempted to view the already agreed upon act of entrapping or deterring these persevering pests as a noble sport? For a small fee, payable to a Beefeater, a gentleman might man the nets himself, keeping tally against his fellow of migrants caught or driven away. The deterred migrant would have a higher value than the migrant entangled, for the latter will need to be dealt with at further damage to the national purse. “But what if, come the agreed time, two sportsmen have alighted upon the same score? How may the deadlock be broken? Were the migrant to expire and slip back lifeless into the cold waves, that expiration having perhaps been abetted by a swift seal-blow upon the head from a shillelagh, should not the netsman who eased the heavenward migration of such a brave but misguided soul be rewarded with an extra point against the tally of his fellow? “And might not the expiry of a child migrant be worth twice the points of a parent, the infant threatening to further drain the coffers should it survive and breed? As the hunting of the fox for sport is easily justified by Reynard’s taste for the flesh of Chauntecleer, so the watery rest-taking of the child mariner, though doubtless an amusing process in which to participate, is made acceptable by way of its benefits to the national balance.” But it seemed contrived, the concepts of state-approved cannibalism and state-approved migrant-murder not quite grinding together, and I deemed it unworthy of publication in so august a journal as the Observer. Instead, I wrote a simple parody of that week’s Conservative attempts to pass off the incoming no-deal Brexit as an Australian-style trade bonanza, and returned to my monetised study of Swift. But last week, the Conservative scum voted down the footballer Marcus Rashford’s plea that the increasing number of economically untenable families in Covid Britain should be assisted in feeding their children during half-term. And the arguments offered up in defence of this decision were couched in terms the writer of A Modest Proposal would have recognised. I looked from one to the other and it was impossible to tell which was which. And it made me wonder, would it be such a bad idea, really, to take those children our society cannot feed, and to make some practical use of them?"
2020-08-27T06:00:46Z,Greece has a deadly new migration policy – and all of Europe is to blame | Daniel Trilling,"A vital part of international refugee law is the principle of non-refoulement: the idea that states should not push people seeking asylum back to unsafe countries. In a country like the UK, which does not sit next to a war zone, advocates of “tougher” policies to deter asylum seekers will claim that the principle does not apply, since people who reach Britain’s shores will have passed through several peaceful countries before they get there. But if every country looks only to its own interests, and behaves as if asylum seekers are someone else’s problem, then you very quickly end up with a system that traps people in situations where their lives are at risk. That is the system bequeathed by Europe’s panicked response to the 2015 refugee crisis, and in recent months, partly under cover of the emergency conditions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, it has got worse. The revelation by the New York Times that Greece has secretly expelled more than 1,000 asylum seekers, abandoning many of them on inflatable life rafts in the Aegean Sea, is the latest example of this disturbing trend. Since 2015, Greece has effectively been used by the rest of the EU as a buffer zone against unwanted migration, leaving thousands of refugees in unsanitary camps on islands in the Aegean and on the mainland. At the same time, a hastily arranged EU deal with Turkey saw the latter agree to act as border cop on Europe’s behalf, preventing refugees from crossing to Greece in return for financial aid and other diplomatic concessions. This spring, amid rising geopolitical tensions, Turkey decided to send thousands of migrants towards the Greek border as a way of exerting pressure on Europe. It provoked a nationalist backlash, followed by several hardline and legally questionable border control measures from Greece’s conservative New Democracy government. Earlier this year, the New York Times also reported that Greece was operating a secret detention centre at its land border with Turkey, so that it could carry out summary deportations without giving people the right to claim asylum; the latest revelations about its actions in the Aegean fit the same pattern. In the central Mediterranean, where people still attempt to cross to Europe via boats launched from north Africa, mainly by smugglers in Libya, the EU has for several years been trying to stop migration by closing down rescue operations. The consequence is that people are either more likely to die at sea, or they are returned to Libya, a war zone where torture, forced labour and abuse of migrants – some of which occurs at the hands of Libyan officials the EU treats as partners – is widely documented. This spring, Italy and Malta, the countries where most people rescued from the central Mediterranean disembark (and which like Greece have also been used by their European neighbours as buffer zones), closed their ports to rescue ships on the grounds that they were no longer safe havens due to the pandemic. While Italy has since allowed some ships to dock, Malta apparently took the pandemic as an opportunity to form its own private flotilla of merchant vessels to intercept migrants at sea and hand them over to the Libyan coastguard. As the migration monitoring organisation Alarm Phone reported in April (and as I wrote about here), Malta’s reluctance to bring people into port led to a situation in which a boat carrying more than 60 people was allowed to drift at sea for several days, during which time some of the passengers died. It would be easy to place the blame for these situations squarely on the shoulders of countries at the EU’s Mediterranean frontier. But they are acting in a way that most European governments see as beneficial. “I thank Greece for being our European aspida [shield] in these times,” declared Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, during the Greece-Turkey border crisis in March. This includes the UK, which makes use of those buffer zones regardless of Brexit: as coronavirus spread through Europe, the Home Office refused to resettle refugee children trapped in Greece – children who had relatives in the UK and the legal right to join them – only doing so belatedly under pressure from campaigners. The hardline turn in migration policy over the last five years has taken place piecemeal, driven by several competing interests: rightwing populists who see non-European migration as a civilisational threat; centrist politicians trying to keep populists at bay by co-opting some of their demands; and a security and defence industry offering hi-tech solutions, such as the drone surveillance that has replaced naval patrols in the Mediterranean. But it is likely to be formalised next month when the European commission unveils its new pact on migration and asylum, which will shape the bloc’s overall policy in the years to come. The latest commission, appointed last year, infamously signalled its intent by creating the post of commissioner for “protecting the European way of life”. A defence of this shift might be that the refugee crisis provoked an anti-immigration backlash in many parts of Europe, and politicians have a duty to balance competing interests – in this case the need to protect vulnerable migrants with the desire of some voters to limit immigration. But security measures of this sort can end up fundamentally changing the character of states that propose them. A report published this month by Statewatch, a civil liberties NGO that monitors the European Union, warns of an emerging EU “deportation machine”: the EU’s border agency Frontex plans to drastically increase its capacity to assist member states with deportations of migrants who have been refused permission to stay. This expansion, according to Statewatch, increases the risk that “expulsion flights funded and coordinated by Frontex may remove refugees to countries where they are at risk of torture or persecution”, since EU member states are inconsistent in the way they assess people’s asylum claims. The new enforcement measures will be backed up by large-scale collection of personal data: the EU is also building a vast new biometric database to hold the details of all third-country nationals who enter, a plan criticised by privacy experts and migrants’ rights groups. Yet Europe’s governments seem to be in denial about where their policies might lead. Responding to the New York Times investigation, Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said that reports of illegal push-backs were “misinformation” and that his country’s policies were “tough but fair”. Ylva Johansson, the EU commissioner for home affairs, expressed concern at the reports but said she lacked the power to investigate. It would be easy to dismiss what happens at other countries’ borders as a matter for them alone, but the pattern is international, and the erosion of rights it represents should concern us all. When states opt for extreme measures to push refugees away from their territory, it threatens to undermine the entire system that exists to protect them. • Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe"
2020-10-18T19:41:09Z,Body thought to be asylum seeker found on beach near Calais,"The body of a man thought to be an asylum seeker who may have been attempting to reach the Kent coast has been discovered on a beach just outside Calais, according to French authorities. A dead man, aged between 20 and 40, was reportedly wearing an orange life jacket when he was found on the shores of Sangatte, in northern France, on Sunday morning. Pascal Marconville, a Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, said the man had “no identity documents on him”, as he ruled out any third-party involvement. It is feared he drowned trying to make the 21-mile crossing of the strait of Dover. Marconville told the regional French paper Voix Du Nord: “The position of the body and the absence of trampling around suggest that his body was thrown back by the sea.” In August, a young Sudanese refugee, later identified as Abdulfatah Hamdallah, was found dead on the same beach after trying to cross the Channel with another boy in an inflatable dinghy with shovels for oars. Campaigners claimed the unsanitary conditions in Calais and alleged abuse by French police officials force many refugees to embark on the dangerous journey in search of a better life. “It’s desperately sad to hear that another refugee has lost his life trying to cross the English Channel. We can only imagine the pain his friends and family must be feeling now and our hearts go out to them. The refugees in Calais form close-knit, supportive communities and this death will hit them all hard,” Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said. “Refugees take this risk because they are frightened, fleeing appalling horrors in some of the most dangerous places on Earth. They do it because of the grim and unsanitary conditions in Calais, where they are constantly harassed and abused by the authorities. They do it because there is no safe and legal way to have their UK asylum claim heard.” More than 6,100 migrants have arrived in the UK on small boats so far this year, with last month the record for migrant Channel crossings. Campaigners and opposition politicians have criticised the government for lacking compassion in dealing with the small-boat crossings and not making it easier for people to legitimately seek asylum in the UK."
2020-11-25T16:27:44Z,Police investigated over alleged violence at Paris migrant camp,"Two police officers are being investigated for alleged violent behaviour during an operation to break up a protest migrant camp in Paris. The public prosecutor’s office announced it had ordered inquiries into two specific complaints against officers dispatched to remove a group of mainly Afghan migrants from Place de la République in the centre of Paris on Monday evening. One investigation concerns an officer filmed apparently deliberately tripping up a man who was running away from the police, causing him to fall badly. The second concerns a police officer filmed holding a journalist on the ground while appearing to threaten him with a truncheon. Rémy Buisine, a reporter with the news website Brut, claimed he was attacked by the same officer “three times” during the evening. Claire Hédon, the independent defender of rights for France, announced she would be looking into the police actions. Several hundred migrants had set up tents in Place de la République after a call by humanitarian organisations; most had been already thrown out of an ad hoc camp on the northern edge of Paris last week and had nowhere to go. The French authorities sent in a squadron of mobile gendarmes as well as officers from the anti-crime brigade and several companies from a “security and intervention unit” to break up the camp. Despite appeals from a number of local councillors, politicians, lawyers and humanitarian organisers, the police set about pulling up tents, tipping their occupants on to the ground, and attempting to disperse the crowds with teargas. Photographs and video images of the operation spread on social media, prompting the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, to say that some of the scenes were “shocking” and unacceptable, and to order an inquiry. However, on Wednesday, Darmanin reiterated his support for the police. “These people were mostly without papers and illegally installed on Place de la République. This clearing [of the camp] was completely legitimate,” he told France 2. “There were unacceptable actions from some police officers … these have to be looked into … those who messed up will be punished.” The prosecutor’s office has asked the police force’s internal disciplinary body to look into the two accusations of “violence by a person with public authority”. The police commissioner, Matthieu Valet, who also represents the union Syndicat Indépendant des Commissaires de Police, told Marianne magazine: “The images are disastrous, but this behaviour doesn’t represent the police.” The row over the operation came as French MPs approved a new law that would prevent media publishing or broadcasting images identifying on-duty police with “deliberate” intent to harm. Article 24 of the Global Security Law was amended to state it would not threaten the “right to inform”. But critics have said it remains a threat to press freedom. Valet accused the humanitarian organisations of “using human misery to obtain shocking pictures”, and said police officers were “subjected to violence every day”. On Tuesday evening, several thousand people gathered in Place de la République to protest against “police violence”. Another demonstration has been called for Saturday. In a separate affair Hédon has called for “disciplinary action” against four police officers accused of seriously injuring Théo Luhaka, a youth worker, when they arrested him in 2017. Hédon said this action should be separate from any legal move. The public prosecutor has called for legal proceedings against three of the four officers for violence against Luhaka, who claims an officer sodomised him with a truncheon during the arrest, leaving him with injuries requiring lifelong medical care."
2020-07-21T06:15:35Z,Rohingya face ‘cruel’ caning sentence in Malaysia as hostility to refugees grows,"A group of Rohingya refugees who survived a treacherous journey at sea now face caning and seven months in jail after they were convicted under the immigration act in Malaysia, where activists have warned of an alarming rise in xenophobia and inhumane treatment of the migrants. Hundreds of arrests and a sharp rise in hate speech have shocked refugees and migrants who had seen Malaysia as a welcoming country, particularly for Muslims, despite not being signed up to the 1951 refugee convention. Over recent months, Malaysia has been widely condemned for turning away boats carrying Rohingya refugees fleeing desperate conditions in camps in Bangladesh. Some boats were allowed to dock, but the hundreds of refugees onboard are understood to remain in detention, according to Amnesty International. A group of 31 Rohingya men who disembarked from a boat in April have since been convicted under the Immigration Act, and sentenced to seven months in prison, while at least 20 have been sentenced to three strokes of the cane. Nine women are also facing seven months in prison, while 14 children have been charged and are facing jail terms. The sentencing, announced in June, has been condemned as “cruel and inhuman” by Amnesty International, which has called for the decision to be overturned. There is growing concern over the treatment of migrants and refugees in Malaysia, where mass raids were carried out in May. One Yemeni, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said they were imprisoned for weeks after immigration police stopped them on the street. Though later freed because they were registered under the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR), they are now too scared to leave home. The prospect of being sent to detention centres, notorious for violence and illness, has become a most stark threat. At least 735 cases of coronavirus were reported in the centres in June, almost 10% of the country’s total. Refugees and aid workers say detention conditions are cramped and unsanitary, and food is limited. “It was a horrible situation, the treatment they subjected us to. They took us into the prison, it was small but with so many people, and so many people were ill … it was like we were animals,” said the Yemeni refugee. “There were a lot of Covid-19 cases … the ill, and those who weren’t, were all next to each other without separation.” Another Yemeni refugee told the Guardian: “They put me in a jail cell for three days without food, without drink or even a toilet. Then they transferred me to a cell in a big prison where there were 200 people. “I was in the prison and then we were taken out in handcuffs, all together, and they started beating us. Four of the guards beat us and then said we’re being released. The [coronavirus] and the beatings were agonising.” Malaysian officials deny poor treatment in the centres. Director-general of health Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said positive cases from detention centres are isolated in hospitals, and those who have been in contact with these patients are quarantined in special facilities. The raids that started in May followed a surge in xenophobia after Malaysia was criticised for sending boats carrying hundreds of Rohingya refugees back to sea. Almost 600 undocumented migrants were arrested in the first weekend. Authorities were criticised for rounding up residents and forcing them to sit on the ground without social distancing. A refugee advocate who helps detainees access legal support said that victims they had spoken to included many with UNHCR cards, who were arrested by police indiscriminately rounding up foreigners. UNHCR confirmed that some had been arrested but later released. Malaysia does not officially grant refugee status, but hosts more than 170,000 UNHCR-registered people, mostly from Myanmar. Tens of thousands more stay informally, having arrived by boat believing Malaysia would offer safety and freedom to work. More recently, Syrians and Yemenis have arrived, and Malaysia is one of very few countries that offers them temporary tourist visas. A new wave of xenophobic attacks began this month, coinciding with the airing of an Al Jazeera documentary which the government called “fake news”. Six journalists who worked on the programme are now being investigated for sedition. Malaysia has threatened to punish foreigners accused of comments “aimed at damaging Malaysia’s image”, stripping one of Al Jazeera’s interviewees of his work visa and investigating activists over Facebook posts. The government has announced that foreigners will be banned from mosques when they reopen. “The government is cracking down on migrants and refugees, instead of upholding everyone’s right to health during Covid,” said John Quinley, human rights specialist at Bangkok-based Fortify Rights. “The environment of fear and intimidation against migrants and refugees must end.” Prominent refugee figures and advocates say they have been threatened on social media in attacks they believe are coordinated, often using similar language. One migrant changed their phone number and moved to a rural area after receiving threatening messages. Nur, a Malaysian activist whose name has been changed for their safety, said their group is providing food to families who were struggling during the lockdown but now fear arrest if they return to work. “We’re still seeing people struggling and this is amplified by the recent regulations set up by our government, even telling house owners that they can’t rent to the migrant and refugee communities,” Nur said. “Every other day there’s new regulations and new targeted speech against the refugees and ‘illegal immigrants’.” One Rohingya refugee shared messages from their local religious school, seen by the Guardian, saying their child would not be allowed to return, despite having paid fees. Refugee children are not allowed to attend formal schools, and rely on religious schools. UNHCR said it has not had access to Malaysian detention centres since last August. “This has unfortunately prevented UNHCR from seeing detained persons of concern in order to determine those in need of international protection and to advocate for their release. With the recent developments of raids, this continues to be a growing concern,” the agency said in emails. “We are aware and concerned that there remains in detention a number of persons of concern, including vulnerable individuals, requiring our attention.”"
2020-12-16T18:17:17Z,Home Office criticised over plan to house asylum seekers at Yarl's Wood,"A former immigration removal centre is being expanded to house up to 200 men as they await decisions on asylum claims, it has emerged, triggering accusations of a fresh “hostile environment” policy from the government. The construction of prefab-style accommodation at the privately run Yarl’s Wood centre in Bedfordshire follow a series of damning reports on conditions at two former army barracks sites in Kent and Pembrokeshire being used to hold up to 600 asylum-seeking men. While Yarl’s Wood is not currently being used as an immigration removal centre, the move to construct more accommodation will raise fears of a blurring of the lines between housing for migrants lawfully pursuing an asylum claim and detention of those marked for removal. The government is considering a number of sites for housing asylum seekers across the country, including up to 500 in temporary buildings on Ministry of Defence land next to the small Hampshire village of Barton Stacey. The immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, confirmed in the House of Commons that the accommodation was being built at Yarl’s Wood in answer to a question from the Labour MP for Bedford and Kempston, Mohammad Yasin. Yasin branded the accommodation a “hostile environment” and said he understood it would be ready for its first intake on 24 December. He said: “I’m very concerned that the Home Office is using completely inappropriate accommodation to house asylum seekers who may be suffering severe trauma in environments that appear punitive and hostile. “These camps are being set up at lightning speed in remote areas with zero consultation with stakeholders such as local authorities and the asylum sector. “I am concerned about the conditions asylum seekers will be held in and their access to legal and health services in such a remote location. Though I’m told the residents are free to come and go as they please, this is far from the case.” As a removal centre, Yarl’s Wood was dogged by controversies including hunger strikes, critical inspection reports and allegations of sexual abuse. The Home Office confirmed earlier in the year it was being used to house recent migrant arrivals. The number of small boat arrivals across the Channel has surged to record levels this year, with more than 8,000 migrants and refugees travelling across the Dover Strait, compared with fewer than 2,000 in 2019. However, total asylum applications are down year on year as the Covid-19 pandemic has cut off other methods of travel and limited migration flows. In response, Philp said: “It is not a hostile environment, the accommodation meets the requires standards.” He added: “We are having to provide additional units because the number of people being supported has gone up enormously as a result of coronavirus.” He said the number of cessation notices – the revocation of asylum support – had also dropped, putting pressure on the asylum system, but that these would soon increase again."
2020-08-08T14:04:40Z,MoD considering request to deploy navy to stop Channel migrants,"Alarm is growing over UK proposals to introduce hardline measures to discourage refugees and migrants from seeking sanctuary after the Ministry of Defence confirmed it was considering a Home Office request to deploy navy vessels in the Dover Straits. It comes after the immigration minister, Chris Philp, called for migrants caught crossing the Channel to be fingerprinted and face “real consequences”, before a meeting next week with his French counterparts. Suggested measures to make crossing the Channel “unviable”, outlined in an article for the Daily Telegraph by Philp, are also understood to include taking migrants into custody for breaking the law and back to French ports rather than to the UK. The Times reported that ministers are also considering blocking migrant boats in the Channel before they enter British waters, modelled on Australian tactics used against migrants arriving by boats from neighbouring Indonesia. On Saturday afternoon, the Ministry of Defence said it was “working hard to identify how we can most effectively assist” after receiving a request from the Home Office to patrol the Channel for migrant boats under the military aid to the civilian authorities protocol. “As ever, the MoD will do all it can to support HMG requirements,” the spokesperson added. However, it comes after an MoD source dismissed the “inappropriate and unnecessary” idea and lawyers warned pushbacks at sea were unlawful. “It’s beyond absurd to think that we should be deploying multimillion-pound ships and elite soldiers to deal with desperate people barely staying afloat on rubber dinghies in the Channel,” they said. “It could potentially put people’s lives at even greater risk.” More than 350 migrants arrived on UK shores on Thursday and Friday – and Kent county council revealed it had already taken 400 unaccompanied migrant children into its care this year. As the government seeks to respond to the increased crossings, Philp wrote: “These crossings are not only dangerous and illegal, but totally unnecessary. Migrants who set off from France have travelled through safe EU states with well-run asylum systems. “Genuine refugees should claim asylum there, not risk their lives at the hands of criminals, and break the law by seeking to enter the UK by illicit means. The government is determined to make this route unviable.” He added that the UK wants the French to ensure that migrants caught attempting to sail cannot do so again by removing them from Calais and providing “options to seek protection in France or return to their home countries”. Philp continued: “Illegal migrants need to be fingerprinted so they know that once detected, they face real consequences if they try to cross again. This will help us break up the gangs that facilitate these crossings.” Tony Smith, a former director-general of Border Force, said smugglers were exploiting a law that obliges a country’s vessels to rescue people once they enter the waters of their jurisdiction. He called for Britain to negotiate an agreement with France to allow people to be instantly returned. “Once they are under our jurisdiction we will immediately face asylum claims,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Jack Straw, a former Labour home secretary, urged against pushing migrants back to France, saying it would not work and warning of potentially fatal capsizing. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “It will only take one of these dinghies to capsize and everybody to drown, which is perfectly feasible, for there to be a hullabaloo including in the Conservative party and for the policy to have to be reversed so I wouldn’t go down that route. “The only way to solve this is for us to say to the French, ‘Yes, these people are fleeing France and to that extent they will cease to be your problem but it is a major problem for you because you’ve got organised criminality which is extending into drugs, into people trafficking and much else besides.” Charities criticised the lack of legal routes to claim asylum in the UK while admonishing the government for “shirking” responsibility. Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “It’s deeply troubling the government is trying to shirk its responsibility to help people fleeing from some of the world’s most violent and oppressive countries. “Britain is better than this. Refugees deserve better than this. We must step up alongside other countries and make our contribution to the global refugee crisis. “The government must urgently restart its hugely successful refugee resettlement programme, on hold since March, and make a long-term commitment to this. It must also finally reform the restrictive rules on family reunion so that families are not kept apart.” Fizza Qureshi, the co-chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, said: “Instead of focusing on enforcement and preventing these crossings, they need to concentrate on providing safe and legal routes so no one has to risk their lives via a treacherous journey in the first place.”"
2020-09-22T05:00:06Z,How rescuing drowning migrants became a crime,"As patrol boats with flashing blue lights surrounded the Iuventa, just outside the port of Lampedusa on the evening of 1 August 2017, its crew were more annoyed than alarmed. For three days, the old fishing trawler, crewed by volunteers from the German NGO Jugend Rettet (Youth Rescue), had answered a string of requests from the Italian coastguard that to them made no sense. “This madness hopefully will soon be over,” read a message sent from the ship’s bridge to Jugend Rettet base camp shortly after 10pm. In the summer of 2017, two years on from the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis, smugglers in Libya were still sending hundreds of people a day to sea in unsafe rubber boats, and the Iuventa’s crew wanted to be where the action was. In a patch of sea just off the coast of north Africa, about a dozen NGO ships were searching for boats in distress – a direct challenge, as many of them saw it, to European governments that had scaled back state-run rescue efforts. Yet the Iuventa had been following instructions that drew it further away from the rescue zone and closer to Italian territorial waters. According to the ship’s records, the Italian coastguard first told the crew to rendezvous with an Italian navy ship to collect two men found adrift at sea, and deliver them to another. The second ship never turned up. Then they were told to look for a blue and white fishing boat with 50 people on board, apparently foundering in the sea close to Lampedusa. As night fell on 1 August, after a day spent searching the waves in vain, a message came through: call off your search and proceed into port. It was the third time in a few months that the ship had been ordered into the harbour at Lampedusa. In just over a year, the Iuventa – crewed by a group of young, motivated people “who could not stand to see the situation in the Mediterranean any longer”, as one put it to me – rescued more than 14,000 people. Most of these rescues were coordinated by the Italian coastguard, but the relationship was increasingly strained. The Iuventa’s revolving crew of volunteers were outspoken critics of Europe’s border policies, and the small, agile ship took more risks than some of the larger NGO vessels, sailing as close as possible to Libyan waters in order to be able to rescue people from unsafe boats sooner. As one Italian media outlet put it, the ship was “like a sort of Berliner squat out in the middle of the sea – very well organised, radical and antagonistic”. As the Iuventa entered the harbour of Lampedusa, the crew expected to be questioned briefly by police, as they had been on previous occasions, then allowed to get back to work. They were wrong. Within a few hours, their ship would be seized, marking the beginning of a long and still unresolved criminal investigation that leaves 10 humanitarian volunteers facing up to 20 years in prison. In the small hours of 2 August, while a crowd of journalists assembled on the quayside filmed and took photographs, detectives specialising in organised crime searched the Iuventa. The following morning, before the crew were even fully informed of the case against them, details were splashed across the Italian media. This “German extremist NGO”, as one newspaper later put it, was suspected of aiding illegal immigration – a crime in Italian law – by collaborating with Libyan smugglers. News outlets quoted liberally from a case file that showed the Iuventa had been under surveillance for months: there were even transcripts from a recording device placed on the ship’s bridge. Police photographs, labelled and distributed to news agencies, purported to show several occasions on which the ship’s crew had received migrants directly from boats driven by smugglers themselves. “We don’t have anything to hide, and we are looking forward to returning to the search and rescue zone one day, to fight for human rights,” declared a member of the crew, who gave her name as Katrin, in a video statement released to the media. But these were explosive allegations, at a time when migration had become such a toxic issue that Italy’s interior minister declared he “feared for the democratic integrity of the country”. Italy’s populist opposition parties led the charge against rescuers, accusing them of being taxi del mare, a “sea taxi” service for migrants, while the government was pressuring NGOs to limit their operations. In the spring of 2017, two other NGOs had been investigated – but this was the first time a ship had been seized. Within months, under the looming threat of prosecution, NGOs were all but forced out of the Mediterranean. Today, the Iuventa remains impounded, and 10 of its crew members are still waiting to find out if they will face trial. They deny ever working with smugglers, and have assembled documentary evidence that they say proves their innocence. More disturbingly, investigative journalists in Italy and elsewhere have unearthed evidence which appears to show that the surveillance began not with the Italian state, but with a spying plot involving a private security agency and the far-right political leader Matteo Salvini. The case is not yet over, but it has already marked a turning point: in just a few years, Europe has gone from saving lives at sea to attacking the people who do it. And it all began with the moment, in the words of the Italian author and migration specialist Annalisa Camilli, that “humanitarians were transformed from angels at sea into dangerous collaborators with smugglers”. * * * More than three years since he last sailed a rescue mission, Dariush Beigui’s mind still clicks into gear when he sees news of a boat in distress in the Mediterranean. The German skipper, a punk rock fan who pilots barges around the port of Hamburg for a living, mentally prepares to wake up his crewmates, to manoeuvre the Iuventa into position and scan the horizon with binoculars, ready to dispatch the ship’s speedboat. But with the Iuventa sitting idle in the Sicilian port of Trapani, none of this is possible. “The hardest thing for me is to sit here watching social media, knowing that if I was there I could help,” he told me. “Maybe not to rescue everybody, but at least one person.” I met Beigui in Berlin in early 2020, along with two other members of the “Iuventa 10”, Hendrik Simon and Sascha Girke. All three, now in their early 40s, volunteered to work on the Iuventa after Jugend Rettet launched in 2015 via a crowdfunding campaign. Many of the volunteers knew each other from past campaigns in environmentalist, antifascist and squatting movements, and they brought practical skills to the Mediterranean, along with a DIY ethos: Girke works as a paramedic in a town outside Berlin; Simon, an IT technician from Bremen, had driven speedboats for Greenpeace. In the summer of 2016, when the Iuventa first went to sea, the number of people crossing the central Mediterranean from Libya was at record levels. The people-smuggling trade, once tightly controlled by the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Europe’s behalf, had boomed as the country collapsed into civil war. Since the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, tens of thousands of people a year – displaced by war, looking for work, or just desperate to get out of Libya – paid for passage on overcrowded inflatable dinghies that were pushed out to sea with only a few hours’ worth of fuel. Unless given assistance, once they got into open water, these boats would sink. In 2016, more than 4,500 people drowned or went missing in the Mediterranean. An increasing proportion of the rescues were carried out by private organisations. By 2016, nine separate charities, from global aid agencies such as Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to smaller, newly formed groups, patrolled international waters close to Libya. The Iuventa quickly gained a reputation as one of the more daring rescue outfits. “Saving people from drowning is always a humanitarian act,” Simon told me, “[but] I was going there as a political activist because I don’t agree with European border policies.” While the Iuventa put its speed and agility to use at sea, Jugend Rettet’s volunteers held protest actions on land, calling for “ferries not Frontex” – the provocative suggestion, with reference to the EU’s border agency, that migrants should be allowed to travel freely. Yet 2016 was also the year that anti-refugee politics came to the fore in Europe and the US. Italy, where the majority of people rescued off the coast of Libya disembarked, was finding itself increasingly isolated. Three years earlier, in response to a growing number of shipwrecks on its southern border, Italy had taken the bold step of sending its navy out into international waters to search for boats in distress. The country’s centre-left government gambled that the operation, which it called Mare Nostrum – “our sea” in Latin, after the ancient Roman name for the Mediterranean – would prompt its European neighbours into supporting the rescue effort, and helping look after the people rescued. The hoped-for support never arrived. Mare Nostrum was replaced by a far smaller EU operation, while responsibility for accommodating new arrivals remained with the country in which they disembarked. As Europe’s increasingly panicked governments discussed how to reduce migration across the Mediterranean, Italy’s neighbours began to seal off their land borders, preventing asylum seekers from continuing their journeys. By late 2016, around 200,000 people were stuck in Italy’s slow-moving asylum system, management of which cost well over €3bn a year. Italian coastguard officials began to take a less welcoming attitude to the NGO rescuers. “There was increasingly this delaying and questioning of our missions,” said Girke, who volunteered multiple times as coordinator, either on board the Iuventa or at Jugend Rettet base camp on Malta. One point of contention seemed to be that the Iuventa would often transfer the people it picked up to better-equipped larger ships, so it could quickly return to the rescue zone. According to Girke, officials would often try to insist that the Iuventa took all the people it had rescued back to port – he suspects, to slow down its operations. * * * In October 2016, three employees of a private security agency visited police in Trapani. The three had been working as security guards on board the Vos Hestia, a ship chartered by the UK aid organisation Save the Children, as a condition of the vessel’s insurance. On 10 September, the Vos Hestia had crossed paths with the Iuventa during a rescue: a long, gruelling day of pulling people out of the water, in which six dinghies, each with more than a hundred people onboard, were adrift and sinking. The Iuventa’s deck had become dangerously busy, and the Vos Hestia was one of several ships that arrived to help relieve the pressure. One of the security guards, Pietro Gallo, told police that shortly after the Vos Hestia took some of the Iuventa’s passengers on board, he saw a dinghy heading away from the Iuventa, driven by two “dark-skinned” men. This, he said, “made us believe that the crew of the Iuventa had received migrants from the dinghy … which was returning to the [Libyan] coast with the smugglers onboard.” The security guards assumed this meant that the Iuventa had collected migrants from smugglers by prior arrangement, rather than rescuing people whose lives were in danger. Had the Iuventa’s crew committed a crime? They say they had no contact with smugglers, pointing out that no evidence besides the security guards’ testimony has been offered for the incident, and that several other vessels including an Irish navy ship were present at the scene. Nor, they say, was the alleged incident mentioned in the official Frontex report on that day’s rescue. But after the allegations from security guards, prosecutors in Trapani authorised a surveillance operation, placing an undercover officer on Save the Children’s ship. The officer would pose as a security guard alongside Gallo and his colleagues, watching the Iuventa from afar. In late November, the Iuventa entered port for the winter. By the end of the year, 181,436 people had been rescued from the central Mediterranean – and Italy appeared to welcome the contribution of the NGOs. At the end of the year, Girke told me, he attended a meeting in Rome with the Italian coastguard, to discuss how they could improve cooperation. “They were asking us to come back next year with bigger ships,” he said. * * * In the spring of 2017, six months after Gallo and his colleagues visited the police in Trapani, the prominent opposition politician Salvini made a startling claim on the TV talkshow In mezz’ora (“In half an hour”). In a heated debate with a representative of MSF, Salvini stated that he had seen a dossier by Italy’s secret services about contact between people smugglers and some of the NGOs. “There are weapons and drugs onboard some of those ships,” he added. “How do you know?” asked the presenter, clearly taken aback. “I listen to the people who work on these boats,” Salvini replied. No more details of the “phantom dossier”, as one media outlet described it, ever emerged. But Salvini had been in contact with the security guards on board the Vos Hestia. According to Gallo, in September 2016, the trio emailed AISE, the Italian secret service, with their suspicions about the Iuventa. When nobody there responded, said Gallo, they tried Salvini. “[Salvini] called back a few minutes later,” Gallo told the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano last year. “He wanted to meet us immediately, but we explained that we were about to embark, so he gave us the number of one of his contacts.” According to Gallo, Salvini asked them to secretly document what they saw at sea, and pass the information on to his office via an intermediary. Salvini has only partially confirmed the account, telling Il Fatto Quotidiano that he “disseminated” some “highly interesting” information he received from one of Gallo’s colleagues. What we do know, however, is that in the early months of 2017, Salvini transformed the fortunes of the party he leads, the Lega Nord, by helping bring the claim that NGO rescuers were collaborating with smugglers from the far-right fringe into the mainstream of political debate. The situation in the Mediterranean had become a rallying point for far-right activists across Europe. In December 2016, the Gefira Foundation, an obscure Dutch thinktank that purports to monitor the “extinction” of Europe’s “indigenous peoples”, published a report in which it claimed that search and rescue was a “scam” in which “NGOs, smugglers, the mafia, in cahoots with the European Union, have shipped thousands of illegals into Europe under the pretext of rescuing people”. Within weeks, similar claims then began to circulate among far-right social media accounts. The narrative entered Italian politics, too. In February 2017, a Sicilian prosecutor called Carmelo Zuccaro announced a taskforce to investigate the NGOs, later claiming that smugglers and rescuers were colluding in order to destabilise the Italian economy. The following month, a hitherto unknown blogger, a 23-year-old media and communications student from Turin called Luca Donadel, posted a video to his Facebook page titled “the truth about migrants”, which argued that NGOs were running a “taxi service” for financial gain. Within days, Donadel’s video went viral, shared by Salvini on his own social media accounts, and discussed on Striscia la notizia, a popular satirical TV show. Italy’s other main opposition party, the Five Star Movement, joined the fray, and by April the accusation that the NGOs were “sea taxis” – a phrase coined by the Five Star Movement’s then leader, Luigi Di Maio, dominated the airwaves. As the moral panic intensified, state surveillance of the Iuventa stepped up a gear. In May, the ship was twice ordered to leave the rescue zone near Libya and dock at Lampedusa. Beigui, Girke and Simon now think that this is when the ship’s bridge was bugged, although at the time they had no idea. “Maybe it was a bit naive,” said Simon, “but we were thinking like: ‘Come on, we are rescuing people from drowning, what’s the worst that could happen?’” Italy’s government, under pressure from both its domestic opposition and other European states to reduce migration, was turning against the rescuers. Marco Minniti, a former political head of the intelligence services, had taken over as interior minister at the end of 2016. Unlike his predecessors, Minniti was convinced that the priority was to prevent migrants from leaving Libya. He struck deals with several of the armed groups that controlled Libya, offering training to what remained of the country’s coastguard – and negotiating with the militias that controlled smuggling in the coastal cities, to put a halt to migration. As summer 2017 approached, however, the numbers leaving Libya reached a new record. At the end of June, Minniti had a flight to Washington DC turned around when he heard the news that 12,000 people, rescued from the Mediterranean in the space of a few days, were making their way to Italian ports. After an emergency summit, in which Italian officials briefed the media that NGOs were to blame for encouraging people smugglers, Minniti unveiled a tough new code of conduct for rescue vessels. It included the demand that boats bring rescued migrants directly to port rather than transferring them to larger ships, a condition that would have severely limited the operations of smaller vessels like the Iuventa. Several NGOs, including Jugend Rettet, refused to sign the document in its original form; MSF said the code would lead to “more drownings”. By mid-August, it seemed as though Minniti’s agreements in Libya were finally taking effect. The number of people crossing the Mediterranean fell drastically. But as lurid details from the Iuventa case file spread throughout the media, the NGOs were now the centre of attention. “The NGOs don’t give a toss about migrants, it’s just the business opportunity of the moment,” said “Lucio M”, one of the security guards who worked with Gallo on board the Vos Hestia A wide section of Italian society, and most of its politicians, had come to see the rescuers as a threat. Donations to the aid organisations plummeted, and in the second half of 2017 several of the major operators, including Save the Children and MSF, suspended or halted their rescue missions. Anti-immigration sentiment continued to rise – and by the autumn, even Pope Francis, a vocal supporter of migrants’ rights and humanitarian rescue, appeared to give ground. In September, he stated that it was understandable for “a country which has done so much, like Italy, to ask itself: can I host everyone? Do I have enough space?” As a general election approached in early 2018, opposition politicians continued to attack the government on migration, with Salvini leading the charge. Support for the Lega soared: as recently as 2014 the party was supported by just 6% of the population; in 2018 it received 17%. The rightwing electoral alliance it formed part of topped the poll, with 37% of the vote. Entering coalition with the Five Star Movement, Salvini was appointed interior minister. * * * One idea – that saving people from drowning only encourages others to make the journey – has come to dominate Europe’s response to migration across the Mediterranean. Depending on your point of view, this is either hard-headed realism – or a terrifying, inhumane calculation. But the debate that surrounds this issue almost always obscures the perspectives of the people who attempt the journey. In October 2016, at around the same time that Gallo and his colleagues were talking to detectives in Trapani, a young man from Gambia called Malik saw what he calls “a miracle out of nowhere”. The 20-year-old was crammed with 130 others into a dinghy launched that morning from Libya, the weather had turned rough and the dinghy was starting to sink. As people around him said their prayers and prepared for death, Malik spotted a ship on the horizon. Taking a white shirt from a fellow passenger, he stood up and waved it furiously. “They told us to stay calm, that we’d all be rescued,” said Malik when I spoke to him recently. “They gave us life vests and towed our boat all the way to the ship, and we got out one by one.” Malik, who left his home in Gambia in 2014 after his father stabbed him during a drunken argument, was one of two people rescued by the Iuventa who I tracked down earlier this year. His journey to the Mediterranean had been brutal. He had borrowed money to pay for his passage across the Sahara desert, then worked on building sites in Libya, hoping to save up enough money for a journey to Europe. But he was kidnapped and held for ransom by one smuggling gang, then detained by another in a camp near the coast for seven months until his mother sent him money to buy his way out. Abdulrahman, who left his home in Sierra Leone during an outbreak of Ebola and was just 16 when he was saved from a waterlogged dinghy in August 2016, had a similar story. He told me that by the time he left Libya, he was so desperate that he had spent five days hiding among trees and scavenging for food outside the port of Sabratha, looking for a way to sneak into the camp where smugglers were sending boats out to sea. “In Libya, trust me, there is slavery there – they treat people like animals,” he said. The widespread abuse of migrants in Libya, above all of people from sub-Saharan Africa, goes back at least two decades: in 2005, an Italian parliamentary commission heard that people were being locked up “like dogs” in detention centres built by Gaddafi, partly as a result of requests from European governments to limit migration to their shores. Gaddafi is gone, but there is still a well-documented overlap between smugglers and officials in what remains of the Libyan state. As Maria Serrano, a migration researcher for Amnesty, put it to me: “NGOs don’t only save lives at sea, they monitor what is happening, and what the Iuventa and others were doing was bearing witness to the awful violations in Libya by trying to assist the survivors.” In June 2018, Italian prosecutors officially named 10 Iuventa crew members as suspects. In an attempt to clear their name, the volunteers commissioned an investigation by the London-based researchers Forensic Architecture. Using geolocation techniques, and the Iuventa’s own archive of pictures and video footage, Forensic Architecture discovered what they say are serious discrepancies in the case file. In one instance, from June 2017, Italian authorities say an empty dinghy was being towed by Iuventa crew members back towards Libya. But analysis of video footage shot from another rescue ship, along with wind patterns, suggests that it was being towed in the opposite direction, the crew say in order to be destroyed. In another, from the same day, footage examined by Forensic Architecture suggests that two men seen watching a rescue take place from a distance are “engine fishers” – people who follow migrant boats in order to salvage the parts – rather than smugglers, as the authorities claim. By this time, NGO rescuers had almost completely vanished from the central Mediterranean. Once in his post as interior minister, Salvini engineered a series of standoffs in which he prevented rescue ships from docking in Italy, leaving vessels with hundreds of migrants on board trapped at sea for days. “These jackals put the lives of immigrants at risk,” Salvini tweeted during one such episode. “Will they also go unpunished?” Now back in opposition, after his governing coalition collapsed last year, Salvini is facing a possible criminal trial of his own. This February, the Italian senate voted to strip him of parliamentary immunity and allow magistrates in Sicily to try him for kidnapping, over an incident in which he prevented 131 migrants from disembarking. According to Matteo Villa, a migration researcher at the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a leading Italian thinktank, Salvini’s actions may have been extreme, but he was “expressing the sentiments of all EU governments at the time”. An internal report by the EU border agency Frontex, leaked to the media in December 2016, stated that NGO rescuers acted as an unwitting “pull factor” on migration across the Mediterranean sea. Yet Villa’s own research suggests this is a mistaken premise. A recent study of migration patterns from Libya between 2014 and 2019, co-authored with Eugenio Cusumano and published by the European University Institute, found “no relationship between the presence of NGOs at sea and the number of migrants leaving Libyan shores”. Instead, departures rose or fell with the weather, or due to political conditions in Libya itself. But in the absence of larger-scale rescue operations, the proportion of people who die has increased. Even though the number of crossings has fallen drastically, still 750 people drowned or went missing last year. When I spoke to Malik and Abdulrahman, it was almost four years since they had encountered the Iuventa. Abdulrahman now lives in Germany, where his claim for asylum was granted, and is doing an engineering apprenticeship. “I was very angry to hear that the people who saved our lives are now having problems,” he told me. Malik, meanwhile, is living in a reception centre near Naples, still waiting for a decision on his asylum claim. “I knew what was happening in the Mediterranean and I made a gamble out of it,” he said. Abdulrahman and Malik’s fortunes had diverged – but they were both alive. * * * Last year, Pietro Gallo, the security guard whose actions helped trigger the surveillance of the Iuventa, broke his silence about the affair. “I never witnessed the NGOs collaborating with traffickers,” he told a reporter from the German newspaper Die Zeit. “That was always just a hunch. We put two and two together.” Gallo claimed he hadn’t intended for rescuers to be forced out of the Mediterranean, only that he thought Salvini would use his position “to work out a humanitarian solution on a European level”. In late 2019, a resolution calling for the EU to improve its search-and-rescue operations was narrowly defeated in the European parliament by an alliance of far-right and conservative parties. Ursula von der Leyen, the centre-right president of the European commission – the EU’s executive branch – has promised a “human and humane” approach in the commission’s new migration pact, a document that will set the course of policy over the next few years. But Von der Leyen began her tenure last year by renaming her head of migration “commissioner for protecting the European way of life”, wording that was condemned for its resemblance to far-right propaganda, and quickly changed. At the EU’s land and sea borders, reports describe the violent expulsion of refugees and other vulnerable migrants: this summer, Greece was accused of setting people adrift in the Aegean, while Italy and Malta have both tried to close their ports to rescued migrants, citing the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the migrants who most often get caught at the sharp end, but as governments toughen their border policies, volunteers who step in to help can find themselves treated as criminals. A recent report by Amnesty International found that since 2015, more than 150 people have been investigated or prosecuted in Europe for offering help to migrants. In Italy, since the spring of 2017, 16 separate criminal investigations have been opened into NGO rescue ships. Today, the handful of NGOs that still operate face long battles with the authorities to be allowed into port, and their vessels are still sometimes impounded: on 21 September, a ship belonging to the German NGO Sea-Watch was held in the port of Palermo, for issues including “having too many lifejackets on board”, the fifth time a rescue vessel has been seized. Yet none of the criminal cases have so far come to trial – even though, in the case of the Iuventa, which is now the longest-running active investigation, it has been more than three years since the ship was seized. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will bring charges, pending the result of a forensic search of the crew’s computers and phones. In the meantime, the Iuventa 10 are patiently trying to clear their name – and get their ship back. “We never thought we were a solution to the problem,” Girke told me when I spoke to him earlier this year. “The question for us was: how can we empower people on the move to resist, to end their own suffering? And the very first step was to not let them die.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 24 September 2020.

2020-10-20T17:49:39Z,Airbus to operate drones searching for migrants crossing the Mediterranean,"Airbus and two Israeli arms companies will be paid €100m (£91m) to operate unmanned drones to spot refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean sea to Europe, according to EU contracts. Drone operations over the Mediterranean will start next year, after testing carried out on the Greek island of Crete. Airbus, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate, will work with state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to operate the medium-altitude long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) – known as drones – for “maritime aerial surveillance services”. As well as the Airbus/IAI contract for €50m, the EU has awarded Elbit Systems, a private Israeli weapons manufacturer, a separate contract worth €50m for identical services. The EU has spent increasing amounts of money on policing its borders after the number of refugees and migrants trying to enter Europe rose in 2015, putting putting pressure on the governments of member states. The political backlash prompted a major increase in spending on measures to police Europe’s southern borders. The budget of the agency responsible, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – also known as Frontex – increased from just €6m in 2005 to €142m in 2015, before surging to €460m this year. The Observer reported last year that Warsaw-based Frontex was preparing to use drones. The revelation prompted criticism that the unmanned aerial vehicles could allow the EU to avoid its legal responsibility to save the lives of people in distress at sea. The drones will be based in either Greece, Italy or Malta. The companies will provide the equipment as well as human operators to control the drones via radio and satellite links. IAI claims its Heron drone is capable of flying for over 24 hours, and can range up to 1,000 miles from its base at altitudes of more than 35,000 feet. It has been used extensively by the Israeli and German armed forces. Airbus said the model is not capable of carrying weapons, and will be painted white with Frontex labelling. Elbit Systems claims its Hermes drones can fly for up to 36 hours at up to 30,000 feet. Last month, Elbit announced that Hermes drones had been tested with the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency off the west coast of Wales for search and rescue operations. Airbus and IAI said they hoped the contract would open the door for the use of drones in other civilian contexts. Moshe Levy, IAI’s general manager of the military aircraft group, said: “Flying in Europe’s civilian airspace is important progress for IAI and a solid proof for the RPAS’s ability to fly in civilian routes. I believe this contract will open the door to more civilian markets.”"
2020-08-28T07:39:16Z,Australia's English language program for migrants set for overhaul amid concerns over its effectiveness,"The federal government’s English program for adult migrants and refugees is set for some major changes amid concerns participants were not leaving with a “functional level” of English. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge announced a host of changes to the billion-dollar Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), including lifting a cap on class hours, and removing the five year time limit on eligibility. This means recent migrants will be able to access English classes for free until they have “functional English”, which the government defines as having the language skills to participate in society. “Without English language skills, migrants are less likely to get a job, less likely to integrate, and less likely to participate in our democracy,” Tudge said. The program, delivered by service providers around the country, currently provides migrants with 510 hours of language tuition for free. But participants are only completing 300 of those hours, according to Tudge, with 21% leaving without “the basic language skills to enable participation in society”. “This is not to blame anyone whose English language proficiency is poor, but clearly full participation in the community is difficult when there are language barriers,” he said. Catherine Scarth, chief executive officer at AMES Australia, welcomed the changes, saying there was a lot of work to do to ensure the changes benefit people looking to learn English. “Five hundred and ten hours isn’t adequate for some people to move from no English at all, to something that’s functional,” Scarth said. “A refugee for instance, coming from a situation with very limited schooling, who might not be literate in their own language, and who might be older, coming to learn English in 510 hours is almost impossible.” The program, as it stands today, provides a structure for service providers to deliver the classes. The structure allows for some flexibility for participants’ situations, with some elements focused on vocational contexts. Scarth said that the government was consulting service providers on the changes, and that it may take years before the changes are enacted. “Whilst I think it is a standout program, one that Australia has provided since post-war migration, it is timely that the minister has taken these actions.” The acting minister said estimates showed close to a million people across Australia lack English language proficiency, impacting potential employment and community cohesion. The changes come as the government faces the challenges to social cohesion from the coronavirus pandemic, with Tudge saying the pandemic had revealed the challenges in communicating with multicultural communities through traditional means. “Whilst we have produced over 4,600 materials translated into 63 languages to accommodate this, the challenge in engaging with all Australians remains,” he said. Tudge also indicated that changes will be made to citizenship tests to include new questions “on Australian values”, but did not elaborate on what those changes would be. “The stronger focus on Australian values in citizenship testing will be an important part of helping protect our social cohesion into the future,” Tudge said. More than 200,000 people became Australian citizens in the 2019-20 financial year – a record. Scarth believes it is high time services provided to new Australians adapted to their needs. “There’s a lot of work to do, to make sure that the changes will benefit people learning English, and there’s a lot that we need to do to make sure that we are providing the flexibility for students to learn and be engaged.”"
2020-12-14T11:14:14Z,Migrant worker at Malaysian medical glove manufacturer dies of Covid-19,"A worker at the biggest global producer of medical rubber gloves has died after contracting Covid-19, in the first known Covid-related death of an employee at the Malaysian company since the virus began to spread through its factories and dormitories. Top Glove’s profits have surged during the pandemic, but the company has faced repeated criticism over its treatment of migrant workers, including claims that it has failed to protect them from the coronavirus. More than 5,400 people have been infected, many of them Top Glove workers, due to outbreaks at the company’s factories, where workers have warned there is little social distancing. On Saturday, a 29-year-old worker, originally from Nepal, died after being diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia with lung fibrosis. He had worked at Top Glove’s manufacturing facility in Klang, 25 miles (40km) west of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, for more than two years. It is not known whether he contracted the virus at work. The company, which makes a quarter of the world’s medical latex gloves, has faced multiple allegations of exploitation from migrant workers. Prior to the pandemic, in 2018, the Guardian revealed allegations that workers at the factories were subject to forced labour and overtime, debt bondage, withheld wages and passport confiscation. As sales of protective equipment soared over the past year, workers said they have toiled for long hours to meet demand. In April, employees told the Guardian they were not being provided with adequate protection, and that they were working 12-hour shifts, six days a week, with some earning as little as £7 a day. Workers, who are mostly from Nepal and Bangladesh, also reported that they were sleeping in 24-person dorms, taking crowded buses to work and that social distancing in factories was not maintained. Top Glove has not yet responded to a request for comment, but has previously rejected claims that workers have been mistreated. Last month the Malaysian government introduced strict movement controls and ordered the staggered closure of Top Glove factories so that workers could be screened and quarantined. The labour department has since said it would file charges against Top Glove over its worker accommodation, which it said was overcrowded and poorly ventilated. US Customs and Border Protection placed an import ban on two of Top Glove’s subsidiaries in July, following allegations of forced labour, but the company has benefitted from huge demand elsewhere. It reported a net profit of $470m for the financial year ending August – up from $90m the previous year. In September, the Guardian found that, despite allegations of worker abuses, medical gloves made by the company had been recently supplied to at least one NHS hospital. Top Glove said in a statement at the time that “employee safety, health and wellbeing have always been of utmost importance” and listed a number of steps it had taken to protect workers during the coronavirus. Andy Hall, a workers’ rights campaigner, said international buyers and government regulators had “turned a blind eye” to concerns to “ensure faster and cheaper delivery of much needed PPE during the pandemic”. The outbreak in Top Glove facilities is another reminder of the vulnerability of migrant workers during the pandemic. Earlier this year, Singapore faced a major outbreak in cramped workers’ dormitories, where people slept on bunk beds with as many as 20 to a room."
2020-09-15T18:07:25Z,The Guardian view on EU migration policy: past time it had one | Editorial,"Despite the searing heat and the absence of a viable alternative, it was reported this week that some former occupants of the burnt-out Moria refugee camp on Lesbos were refusing to move to temporary tented accommodation elsewhere on the island. They fear that if they do so, they will just be forgotten about all over again. Who can blame them? For years the rest of Europe has known of the squalor, overcrowding and desperation at Moria and other detention camps on the Greek islands. The European Union has thrown some money in the direction of Athens and, to a shameful extent, left the Greek government to get on with it. At the end of last year, Greece was hosting around 200,000 migrants, the vast majority of whom had crossed the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Yet during the past five years, a mere 15,000 arrivals have been relocated to other EU countries. As the numbers have grown, the initial generosity of spirit shown by islanders has evaporated. Mainland politicians have become justifiably embittered by the disproportionate burden that Greece, along with Italy and Malta, is being asked to carry. Resentment has bred cynicism. It was clearly hoped, though never publicly stated, that the appalling living conditions endured by migrants, and the interminable wait for their applications to be processed, might discourage others from making the same journey. As arrivals continued this summer, Greece’s conservative government was accused by human rights organisations of illegally and secretly expelling more than 1,000 asylum seekers. A Guardian investigation found similar tactics being used off the Maltese coast. The Moria blaze, and the migrant protests that followed it, must mark the end of this scandalous escalation of hostilities against the vulnerable, and the rest of Europe must recognise its complicity in it. Britain, predictably and shamefully, has sat on its hands since the fire and done nothing. Angela Merkel on Tuesday pledged that Germany would take 1,500 migrants from the Lesbos camp. But more important in the long term is the commitment by Mrs Merkel and the European commission to take a direct role in building and running a dignified reception site for migrants on the island. Most crucially, other member states must be persuaded to take seriously article 80 of the EU treaty, which demands a “fair sharing of responsibility” on migration issues. Next week, the European commission will unveil its long-delayed plan to establish a common asylum and migration policy. Once again, countries will be asked to accept a more equitable distribution of migrants across the union. The European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, has expressed hope that the spirit of the coronavirus recovery fund, which pooled EU debt to help hard-hit nations, can be replicated. But given the implacable opposition of eastern European countries such as Hungary and Poland to a quota system of any kind, it is hard to see how a scheme could work without a mandatory component. Since the peak of 2015, the number of irregular migrants seeking to enter the EU has plummeted. Ms Johansson put it well when she said that Europe does not have a migration crisis right now, but “some migrants are in crisis”. It is past time for something to be done about their predicament."
2020-11-13T16:00:34Z,"Violent extremism linked to failure of migrants to integrate, EU says","The rise of violent extremism in Europe has been linked to the failure of migrants to integrate, in a hard-debated joint declaration by EU governments on the recent terror attacks. The statement by EU home affairs ministers was described by Horst Seehofer, Germany’s interior minister, as a “great sign of solidarity” when delivered on Friday but it had been heavily watered down from a controversial initial draft. After a week of disagreements over the contents of the proposed declaration pushed by France, Austria and Germany, references to Islam were removed along with demands for newcomers to learn the languages of their new home and “earn a living for oneself”. The EU capitals nevertheless highlighted the need to improve social cohesion in Europe as part of its reaction to a spate of terrorist murders in Paris, Dresden, Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Nice and Vienna. “Integration is a two-way street,” the declaration said. “This means that migrants are expected to make an active effort to become integrated, while help in this regard is important.” The statement issued on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in Paris, in the Bataclan theatre and outside the Stade de France offered few new policy initiatives. Talk of sanctions against those who fail to integrate was removed and replaced with a softer warning to NGOs found to be breaking the law. “Organisations that do not act in accordance with relevant legislation and support content that is contrary to fundamental rights and freedoms should not be supported by public funding, neither on national nor on European level,” the statement said. “Also, the undesirable foreign influencing of national civil and religious organisations through non-transparent financing should be limited.” Earlier in the week, Charles Michel, the European council president and a former prime minister of Belgium, had called for the establishment of a European training institute to “train” imams. The statement instead merely said the bloc should “promote that religious education and training – preferably within the EU – is in line with European fundamental rights and values”. The initial draft of the declaration had raised concerns within the governments of the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg about the linking of counter-terrorism with migration and the clear focus on “Islamism”. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, had made the point during a joint press conference with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the chancellors of Germany and Austria, Angela Merkel and Sebastian Kurz, on Wednesday. The declaration was subsequently broadened to reflect concerns about the rise of the far-right, as well as Islamist terrorism."
2020-11-12T19:13:08Z,More than 110 migrants die in Mediterranean in three days,"Four shipwrecks in the space of three days have claimed the lives of more than 110 people in the Mediterranean, including at least 70 people whose bodies have washed up on the beach of al-Khums, in western Libya. According to the UN migration agency (IOM), that boat was reported to be carrying more than 120 people, including women and children. Forty-seven survivors had been brought to shore by the coastguard and fishermen, while the bodies of at least 74 people were floating near the water’s edge on Thursday. A few hours after the bodies were reported, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) helped three women who were the only survivors of another shipwreck, which killed 20 people off the coast of Sorman, in Libya. “Rescued by local fishermen, they were in shock and terrified,” MSF wrote on Twitter. “They saw loved ones disappear beneath the waves, dying in front of their eyes.” Taking advantage of good mid-autumn weather, people smugglers have sent hundreds of migrants to sea in the last week, according to charities. The majority of the journeys have ended in tragedy. On Wednesday, six people died after the dinghy in which they were travelling with more than 100 migrants capsized off Libya’s coast. A six-month-old boy was among the victims. The boy, who had survived the shipwreck, died onboard a rescue boat. Named Joseph and originally from Guinea, he was saved by rescuers from the Spanish non-governmental organisation Open Arms late on Wednesday morning after the dinghy reportedly began to deflate. At least five other asylum seekers died as a result of that incident. “This is a massacre at Europe’s borders,” said a spokesperson for Alarm Phone, a hotline for migrant boats in distress. “What else can we say? We have called for radical changes for years and still the dying continues. It is devastating.’’ Open Arms wrote on Twitter: “Despite the enormous commitment of our medical team, a six-month-old baby has just died. We requested an urgent evacuation for him and other people in serious conditions, but he didn’t make it. How much pain and sorrow!” The dinghy had allegedly left Sabratha, Libya, but began to deflate after a few hours. After a patrol aircraft from the European agency Frontex raised the alarm, the Open Arms ship promptly intervened. “When our rescuers arrived, they found themselves in front of a dramatic scene,” Riccardo Gatti, the president of Open Arms Italy, said. “The boat had practically imploded and hundreds of people found themselves in the water, in the open sea – some were children.” Judging Joseph’s condition to be serious, the rescuers asked the Maltese and Italian authorities to evacuate him for medical treatment. However, when the Italian coastguard arrived, Joseph had already died. “We did all we could to rescue those onboard,” said the medical team of the NGO Italian Emergency, operating onboard the Open Arms. “All this took place just a few kilometres away from an indifferent Europe. Instead of preparing a structured search and rescue system, they instead continue to bury their heads in the sand, pretending not to see the cemetery that the Mediterranean Sea has become.” On Tuesday, another child, whose age is unknown, was among 13 people who died in a separate shipwreck off Libya’s coast. Eleven survivors were taken back to Libya. ‘‘Change is necessary now, more than ever, to guarantee effective rescue at sea and prevent new tragedies,’’ said Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesperson for IOM. In 2020 alone, “over 10,300 migrants have been intercepted at sea and sent back to dangerous Libya”, Di Giacomo said. According to IOM figures, since the beginning of October, at least 30 migrants have died at sea while trying to reach Italy. Since the beginning of 2020, about 575 people have died in the central Mediterranean, but the real number is estimated to be considerably higher, according to IOM. Open Arms is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean. Many other rescue boats are blocked in Italian ports because officials refuse to authorise their departure. “Is the European Union watching?” MSF wrote on Twitter. “Step the search and rescue capacity up, or let us save lives.”"
2020-10-23T09:31:42Z,Croatia denies migrant border attacks after new reports of brutal pushbacks,"Croatia has dismissed allegations of violence by its border patrol after new reports emerged this week of border police allegedly beating, robbing and sexually abusing migrants. On Wednesday the head of home affairs for the European Commission, Ylva Johansson, said that she was taking the allegations “very seriously”. The Croatian government said that following the latest accusations, it would launch an investigation with the goal of removing any doubt about police conduct and punishing any possible misdemeanours. Yesterday the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) said they had taken new testimonies from a group of 23 migrants intercepted on Monday in woods near the Croatian–Bosnian border. The group, mostly from Bangladesh, had all entered the country from Bosnia. They say they stopped to sleep but awoke to find themselves surrounded by men armed with truncheons, pistols and night vision goggles – the Croatian police who patrol the EU’s longest external border. “‘How many of you are gay?’ asked a policeman, wearing a black uniform and a balaclava,” one Bangladeshi man said to the DRC medical team. “At that point, we were stripped naked and ordered to form a line and put our hands on the shoulders of the man in front. They had just robbed us, beaten us with batons and wooden sticks.” “Are you gay?”, the Croatian official allegedly asked one of the migrants before sexually assaulting him with a tree branch. It is the second allegation of sexual violence documented in less than a week by members of the Croatian police against asylum seekers in the Bosnia-Croatia border region. The latest testimonies suggested an increase in the brutality used in pushbacks on the Bosnia-Croatian border. “Croatian authorities have committed to investigate reports of mistreatment at their external borders, monitor this situation closely and keep the commission informed on progress made,” read a statement on social media from Johansson. “Today I am meeting with ministers from the western Balkans to discuss cooperation on migration management in light of the new pact on migration and asylum. I reminded [them] that effective border management must be conducted in full respect of fundamental rights.” On Wednesday, the Guardian reported the case of a man who, on 12 October, with four other Afghan migrants, including two minors, crossed the Croatian border near Šturlić. His account was almost identical to that of the Bangladeshi. In Velika Kladuša, Dr Mustafa Hodžić, who examined the Afghan man, said he had “unmistakable signs of sexual violence. I’ve never seen anything like it, even if it isn’t the first time as a doctor [that] I have seen signs of sexual violence on migrants, which, according the asylum seekers’ accounts, were perpetrated on Croatian territory by Croatian officials dressed in black uniforms.” Last year a group of 36 mostly Syrian asylum seekers, including minors, were stopped by the Croatian police near Donji Vaganac. They reported similar sexual assaults to the watchdog organisation Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN). “We didn’t try to apply for asylum,” one man told BVMN. “How can I apply for asylum or expect to be given protection from a country whose police officers force me to strip to my underwear and [sexually assault me] in front of my wife and children?” According to most victims interviewed by the media and NGOs in recent years, the men responsible for these alleged atrocities are officers in black uniforms and balaclavas, to whom other Croatian police would hand the migrants over, to push them back to Bosnia. Jack Sapoch, from BVMN and a member of No Name Kitchen, an NGO operating in Bosnia, says there is a spectrum of Croatian forces working along the border. “According to our research, these uniforms are consistent with those worn by the Croatian ministry of the interior’s intervention police units, who are deployed to the border from police stations all over the country.” Antonia Pindulić, legal adviser at the Croatian NGO Centre for Peace Studies, said that “in this context, a very important testimony was given by a police officer that revealed the so-called ‘action corridor’, whose actions and manner of operating corresponds to those noted in this case. According to media reports, in 2017, the so-called ‘action corridor’ was formed with the aim of preventing irregular migration. In this initial phase, ‘‘the action was formally legal and it was made of crime-police officers’’. However “following the escalation of the crisis and the relocation of migrant routes to the depths of Bosnia, two years ago the ‘action corridor’ began to deal exclusively with the capture of both smugglers and migrants. Crime-police officers left the group, and ordinary officers, considered surplus in their units, were recruited. ‘’Unfortunately, these types of violations, torture and pushbacks have become systematic practice of Croatian police,’’ Pindulić added. ‘’In four years now, there are hundreds of thousands of victims’ testimonies, photos, videos, medical documentation, reports from the national and international organisations, as well as testimonies about illegal orders from the policemen - but there is no effective, independent investigation done in any of the cases so far.’’ “We have seen the reports, which are cause for concern,” said Jan Kapić, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency in Croatia. “We continue to advocate with the Croatian authorities for establishment of an independent monitoring mechanism that would investigate the reports of mistreatment and abuse at the border.” In June, the Guardian revealed that EU officials were accused of an “outrageous cover-up” for withholding evidence of Croatia’s failure to supervise border forces. Internal emails showed Brussels officials fearful of full disclosure of Croatia’s lack of commitment to a monitoring mechanism that EU ministers had agreed to fund. “The testimonies collected from victims of pushbacks are horrifying,” said Charlotte Slente, DRC secretary general. “More than 75 persons in one week have all independently reported inhumane treatment, savage beatings and even sexual abuse.”"
2020-11-01T19:00:38Z,The Guardian view on Tories and migration: stop the posing | Editorial,"“We don’t see migration as a problem at all: we see people dying at sea as a problem and the existence of the mafias as a problem.” Such was the view expressed last week by Hana Jalloul, secretary of state for migration in Spain. Days earlier, more than 140 people had died off the coast of Senegal, after their ship caught fire and capsized, in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year. Ms Jalloul spoke of efforts to support the regional government of the Canary Islands, which is struggling to cope with the number of arrivals, and stressed her determination to combat organised crime. She also pointed to migrants’ crucial role in Spanish life, including as care workers during the pandemic. British politicians could profit from studying her example in the aftermath of the drowning of a family of four Kurdish Iranians in the Channel. (A fifth member of the same family, aged 15 months, is missing and presumed dead.) Reports of the deaths of Rasul Iran Nezhad, Shiva Mohammad Panahi and their children drew forth platitudes from the home secretary, Priti Patel, about “thoughts and prayers”. But nothing said by her or Boris Johnson did anything to dispel the impression that their attitude to people trying to reach the UK to seek asylum is chiefly antagonistic. While Ms Patel repeated her opposition to “callous criminals exploiting vulnerable people”, there was no serious attempt to sympathise with the migrants’ desperation – or acknowledge that their reliance on smugglers is a matter not of accident but of political choice. On the contrary, recent weeks have seen Ms Patel adopt extraordinarily hostile language towards lawyers representing migrants, as well as towards smugglers. A week ago, senior judges were among several hundred signatories to a letter complaining that her denunciation of “lefty lawyers” had put people at physical risk. The letter followed reports of a man charged with preparing an act of terrorism after attacking an immigration law firm’s office. It isn’t too late for ministers to change course. The Labour peer Alf Dubs’ amendment to their immigration bill would allow unaccompanied children to be reunited with family in the UK after the transition period ends on 31 December. The UK’s refugee resettlement scheme must also be restarted as soon as the new lockdown ends. It was supposed to provide a safe way in for up to 5,000 of those fleeing persecution, but was suspended due to the pandemic. It is right that those who profit from smuggling people across borders must be tackled. But it is cynical to portray the problem as one created by people smugglers while denying the need for viable options. Collapsing fish populations and the climate crisis are among reasons for increased migration from Senegal and the Sahel region of Africa. The war in Syria and ongoing violence in Iraq continue to force people to flee the Middle East. The victims of these disasters must not be blamed. Responsible politicians would address the causes as well as symptoms. They would also keep a sense of proportion, and enjoin the public to do the same. The number of asylum applications in the UK (35,566 in 2019) is a small fraction of that in France and Germany; Turkey is home to around 4 million refugees. But again and again, the UK government chooses hostile posturing over rational policy based on international cooperation, respect for the law and human rights. Could the deaths of three children lead Ms Patel to give it a rest and listen to European politicians such as Ms Jalloul, or even Lord Dubs? Don’t hold your breath."
2020-10-13T16:35:30Z,Migrant traps could breach maritime treaty | Letter,"It would be interesting to know the substance of the presumed consultations by Dan O’Mahoney, the Home Office’s clandestine Channel threat commander, concerning his piratical proposal to lay the marine equivalent of snares and mantraps in the form of nets designed to foul outboard engines’ propellers (Home Office may use nets to stop migrant boats crossing Channel, 11 October). Presumably he’s taken advice from the International Maritime Organization, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the International Federation of Shipmasters’ Associations, the International Transport Workers’ Federation, Nautilus International, the RNLI, the Royal Yachting Association and Trinity House, to mention just a few of the organisations familiar with the practices of safety of life at sea. I’d be very surprised if there wasn’t a consensus among them that any practice designed to impact on safe navigation would be a flagrant breach of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.

2020-12-17T07:11:20Z,Refugees and asylum seekers moved from Mantra hotel in Melbourne,"Refugees and asylum seekers who had been detained at a Melbourne hotel in Preston for more than a year have been moved to another hotel. About 60 men were transported by bus from the Mantra in Melbourne’s north to the Park Hotel in Carlton about midday amid a heavy police presence. Protesters had gathered outside the Mantra since Monday after the men were told they would be transferred to another location. Several people were arrested after the detainees were driven away from the site. The Park Hotel was formerly known as the Carlton Rydges Hotel on Swanston Street which was previously used as a Covid-19 quarantine hotel for returned travellers. About 30 protesters followed the refugees to the Swanston Street hotel before they were cleared by dozens of police officers. One protester was arrested amid minor scuffles with the police. A refugee, Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, told Guardian Australia about midday the men were yet to receive any further information about their new place of detention. He was hopeful conditions would be better at the new site. But he said later on Twitter that the living conditions at the new hotel were worse than the Mantra. The men have been held at the hotel since being flown to Australia from Manus Island under the now-repealed medevac laws last year. Earlier, witnesses at the Mantra in Preston, said a large number of police had gathered, including mounted officers, as the belongings of some detainees were loaded onto a bus. Alison Battisson, a lawyer who represents some of those who were detained at the Mantra, sharply criticised the move on Thursday. “It’s sad and disappointing that the government continues to ignore the law which requires the release of these gentlemen, not the transfer in militaristic conditions to an undisclosed place of detention,” she said. The men had been hopeful they would be released into the community after five asylum seekers who came to Australia through the medevac legislation were last week granted visas. Those hopes were dashed on Monday when the detainees were told they would be moved. The human rights campaigner and former Socceroos captain Craig Foster said on Thursday the decision to move the men rather than release them meant “uncertainty” and “ongoing trauma”. “This is us, Australia,” he tweeted. “When are we going to stop the ridiculous facade and let these refugees, these humans, go?” A Victoria police spokesperson said: “Police will be in the Preston area to provide security overlay and public order assistance in an operation led by the Australian border force.” A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson said: “Detainees from the Mantra Bell City in Melbourne have now been transferred to a new Alternative Place of Detention (APOD).” “As with all immigration detention sites, robust Covid-19 measures are in place. “Transitory people are encouraged to finalise their medical treatment in Australia so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG, or for those who are not refugees, return to their home country. “In line with Australian government policy, no one under regional processing arrangements will be settled in Australia.”"
2020-11-10T11:22:45Z,Inquiry launched into EU commission's protection of migrants at Croatia border,"An official inquiry has been launched into the European commission’s alleged failure to protect the rights of migrants and refugees said to have been robbed and abused by police at Croatia’s borders. The EU ombudsman is investigating the potential complicity of the EU’s executive branch in the maladministration of funds that should have been spent on supervising the behaviour of border officers working at the scene of some of the violence. There have been multiple allegations of aggressive pushbacks of migrants and refugees by Croatian police on the country’s border with Bosnia, including an incident in which a migrant was shot. Croatia has repeatedly denied allegations of violence by its border patrol and in October said it would launch an investigation with the goal of removing any doubt about police conduct. In June, the Guardian revealed that the commission had withheld from MEPs details of the Croatian government’s failure to spend EU money committed to the supervision the police officers on the border. One European commission official privately warned that disclosure of the underspend “will for sure be seen as a ‘scandal’”. The revelation highlighted the Croatian government’s human rights record and the apparent willingness of the EU’s executive branch to cover for Zagreb’s failure. Croatia is seeking to enter the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone – a move that requires compliance with European human rights standards. The ombudsman’s inquiry has been launched in response to a complaint by Amnesty International whose European institutions director Eve Geddie said: “Over the years, Amnesty and other organisations have documented numerous violations, including beatings and torture of migrants and asylum-seekers by Croatian police, whose salaries may have been paid for by EU funds. “Today’s announcement of an inquiry by the EU ombudsman into how the commission allowed the funds to continue to be used without ensuring compliance with human rights is a significant first step towards addressing these flagrant abuses and providing accountability. “By continuing to fund border operations and giving a green light for Croatia’s accession to the Schengen area, the commission abdicated its responsibilities to monitor how EU assistance is used and sent a dangerous signal that blatant human rights violations can continue with no questions asked.” The establishment of supervisory mechanisms to ensure the humane treatment of migrants at the border had been a condition of a €6.8m (£6.1m) cash injection announced in December 2018 to strengthen Croatia’s borders with non-EU countries. The mechanism was publicised by the European commission as a way to “ensure that all measures applied at the EU external borders are proportionate and are in full compliance with fundamental rights and EU asylum laws”. Croatian ministers claimed last year that the funds had been handed over to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Croatian Law Centre to establish the supervisory mechanism. But both organisations subsequently denied receiving the money. In January this year, the commission was asked by Clare Daly, an Irish MEP in the Independents 4 Change party, to account for the discrepancy. A commission official responded that the UNHCR and Croatian Law Centre had established the monitoring mechanism but from “their own funds” to ensure independence from the government. He added: “Hopefully [this] clarifies this matter once and for all”. But both organisations denied being involved in any monitoring project, clarifying that they had only been engaged in an earlier initiative involving the examination of police files. Beyond the apparent inaccuracy of the response to Daly, internal emails suggest the full facts of the “underspending” – as its known to the commission – were also withheld from MEPs. The European commission failed to inform Daly that the Croatian government had decided to ringfence only €102,000 of the €300,000 provided for the monitoring mechanism and that ultimately only €84,672 was actually spent: €17,469.87 was given to the interior ministry and €59,637.91 went to NGOs. A roundtable conference accounted for €1,703.16. “While we know that there has been underspending on the €300,000 … we thought that around €240,000 were nevertheless spent in the context of the monitoring mechanism,” an EU official wrote while discussing how to deal with the MEP’s questions. “Having spent only €102,000, will for sure be seen as a ‘scandal’.” In response to questions by this newspaper at the time, a spokesman for the commission said they had not provided the full information to MEPs as they had an “incomplete” account."
2020-12-10T12:39:34Z,Councils vow to defy UK rule on deporting migrant rough sleepers,"A growing number of councils, charities and other organisations have pledged to boycott new Home Office rules to criminalise and deport migrant rough sleepers. The Home Office changed the UK immigration rules on 1 December, although it has not yet published guidance about how to apply them. Local authorities, MPs, anti-trafficking organisations and homeless organisations including Crisis and St Mungo’s are warning that the rules, which could withhold leave to remain from migrants found to be rough sleeping or revoke it from those who have it, will punish and criminalise some of the most vulnerable. The majority of the UK’s migrant rough sleepers are in London, with about half of those rough sleeping in the capital thought to be migrants. The Greater London Authority is refusing to cooperate with the Home Office and has stated: “The GLA and its commissioned services will not collaborate with such draconian measures.” Haringey council has said it will not collaborate with the Home Office on the new policy, and Islington council has said the same, warning that this kind of cooperation with the Home Office will compromise relationships of trust with vulnerable rough sleepers. Southwark council has also voiced concerns. Public Interest Law Centre is bringing a legal challenge against the rules. It warns that the policy will create a “chilling effect” on migrant rough sleepers’ willingness to approach services for support and so could increase rough sleeping. It says the new rules are so general that migrants who are office workers found sleeping at their desk late at night or travellers sleeping at an airport before catching an early morning flight could find themselves caught up inthem. The centre previously brought a successful legal challenge against a government policy to deport EU rough sleepers in December 2017. The Labour MP Apsana Begum described the policy change as “despicable” and called for it to be scrapped. She said: “It effectively criminalises rough sleepers who were not born in the UK and adds to the draconian rules already facing those who are seeking asylum or permission to remain.” Benjamin Morgan, who runs a rights project for homeless migrants at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: “We’re heartened that opposition is mounting to these changes to the immigration rules, which effectively criminalise rough sleeping among non-UK nationals. We believe these changes are unlawful.” The chief executive of St Mungo’s, Steve Douglas, said: “It is disappointing that this proposed change in approach has not been discussed with the homelessness sector, where there is real concern that it will increase distrust of the Home Office’s intentions and could drive people with a legitimate right to remain away from essential services.” One 38-year-old migrant rough sleeper from east Africa, who has been street homeless for three years, said he feared being rounded up and detained as a result of the new rules. “I’m not allowed to travel, to work or to claim benefits. What are we expected to do? The government is making decisions for us. My life is no longer my own.” A government spokesperson said: “For the small minority of migrant rough sleepers who continue to refuse government and local authority support and repeatedly engage in persistent antisocial behaviour, the new immigration reforms mean they could lose their right to be in the UK. “This would be a last-resort measure, and initially individuals would be asked to leave voluntarily with government support. In the event that they refuse, we may take the step to remove them.”"
2020-12-10T12:39:34Z,Councils vow to defy UK rule on deporting migrant rough sleepers,"A growing number of councils, charities and other organisations have pledged to boycott new Home Office rules to criminalise and deport migrant rough sleepers. The Home Office changed the UK immigration rules on 1 December, although it has not yet published guidance about how to apply them. Local authorities, MPs, anti-trafficking organisations and homeless organisations including Crisis and St Mungo’s are warning that the rules, which could withhold leave to remain from migrants found to be rough sleeping or revoke it from those who have it, will punish and criminalise some of the most vulnerable. The majority of the UK’s migrant rough sleepers are in London, with about half of those rough sleeping in the capital thought to be migrants. The Greater London Authority is refusing to cooperate with the Home Office and has stated: “The GLA and its commissioned services will not collaborate with such draconian measures.” Haringey council has said it will not collaborate with the Home Office on the new policy, and Islington council has said the same, warning that this kind of cooperation with the Home Office will compromise relationships of trust with vulnerable rough sleepers. Southwark council has also voiced concerns. Public Interest Law Centre is bringing a legal challenge against the rules. It warns that the policy will create a “chilling effect” on migrant rough sleepers’ willingness to approach services for support and so could increase rough sleeping. It says the new rules are so general that migrants who are office workers found sleeping at their desk late at night or travellers sleeping at an airport before catching an early morning flight could find themselves caught up inthem.

2020-09-15T13:28:24Z,Greece vows to empty Lesbos of all refugees by Easter after fire,"The island of Lesbos will be emptied of refugees by next Easter, the Greek government has vowed, as it welcomed Germany’s offer to take in 1,500 people left without shelter. Following the devastating fires that destroyed the notoriously overcrowded Moria facility last week, Greece’s top public order official said plans would be accelerated to decongest the outpost. “They will all leave,” the civil protection minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, told the Guardian. “Of the roughly 12,000 refugees here currently, I foresee 6,000 being transferred to the mainland by Christmas and the rest by Easter. The people of this island have gone through a lot. They’ve been very patient.” About 70% of asylum seekers on Lesbos were Afghans who would be awarded refugee status and given travel papers, he said. Recognised refugees can move to another EU member state for up to three months using the documents. Greek police detained five people on Tuesday in connection with the blazes at the camp, and are searching for one other. No more details were given but from the outset officials have attributed the fires to camp residents pressuring authorities to leave. Chrysochoidis, who flew into Lesbos to help oversee relief efforts, welcomed reports that Germany was prepared to take in as many as 1,500 people from Moria. The German coalition government on Tuesday agreed to take in a total of 1,553 people from 408 families whose protected status has been confirmed by Greek authorities, Angela Merkel’s spokesperson said. Last Friday, Germany said it would take up to 150 out of approximately 400 unaccompanied minors from the camp, where more than 12,000 people were left homeless by the fire in the early hours of 9 September. “It’s very generous, very brave,” Chrysochoidis said of the goodwill gesture. “All over Europe, countries have their own internal political problems around this issue but I also think they [EU states] can see we are protecting the bloc’s borders, we have greatly minimised flows.” Merkel insisted on Monday any transfer of migrants to Germany would need to go hand-in-hand with a broader European initiative, emphasising her support for Greek plans for a new reception centre on Lesbos. Apart from Luxembourg, no other country has so far showed a willingness to partake in a pan-European solution to the crisis in Moria. Some countries, such as Austria, have categorically rejected taking in people from the destroyed camp. “If we give in to this pressure now, then we risk making the same mistake we made in 2015,” said chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, referring to Merkel’s decision to take in large numbers of refugees five years ago. Germany’s leader faces domestic pressure from two sides on the issue. Members of her own party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), have warned that any resettlement programme must be carried out in a way as to avoid chaotic scenes akin to those at the height of the 2015 refugee crisis. “We must not go alone,” said CDU delegate Mathias Middelberg. From the other side, Merkel faces calls from her coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), and a number of federal states and city mayors across Germany for Europe’s largest economy to step up its humanitarian efforts. The leadership of the SPD, which will need to approve Merkel and Seehofer’s decision, has pressured its senior coalition to take in more than 5,000 people to alleviate the situation in Greece. German calls for resettlement schemes have until now also faced resistance from Greece, where prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, accused some residents of Moria for trying to blackmail his government by deliberately setting the fires that destroyed their camp. Chrysochoidis insisted it was crucial Moria’s erstwhile occupants move into a temporary camp, close to Mytilene, the island’s port capital, that the government, with the aid of the army had rushed to build. Opposition is such that seven days after the first blaze, only 1,000 had so far agreed to enter the new facility. Athens’ centre-right government has enlisted NGOs and distributed multi-lingual notices in a bid to encourage relocation, saying the new site provides a safe place for asylum seekers to complete applications. Many have denounced the facility as “a new Moria, another prison.” As tensions mounted, the Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachi alluded to the possible use of force if the displaced migrants refused to go voluntarily. Nine riot police units and water cannon have been dispatched to the island. “If this is not possible through discussion, then the police will have to be used,” he told Mega TV. “It is their obligation to move to the new site,” he said acknowledging for the first time that families would likely spend the winter in tents. The Greek government has pledged to build a new structure on the island that will be co-managed by EU agencies but says construction of the camp in a place that has yet to be decided will require at least six months. Concerns over Covid-19 – more than 21 asylum seekers since the fires have tested positive for the virus in addition to 35 who were diagnosed with it before – have made resettlement even more pressing. Close to 12,500 men, women and children have been living out in the open, often in makeshift tents of tarps and bamboo reeds. Some 406 lone migrant children, also in the camp, were flown to the mainland immediately before continuing on to European states that have agreed to accept them. “There are groups of Afghans and I am afraid even some human rights organisations who are encouraging thousands of people not to go in,” said Chrysochoidis, who is seen as the face of the centre-right government’s tough public order policies. “It’s non-negotiable. They will leave the island but they have to go through this new facility and get the requisite legal documents first.” Efforts will be launched in the coming days to clear the charred remains of what had once been Europe’s largest refugee camp. Designed to host no more than 3,000, Moria accommodated almost 10 times that number at its height and was regularly condemned by aid groups for its deplorable conditions. “It was a camp of shame,” the politician admitted, denying that the government was also forcibly pushing back other refugees who were trying to get to Greece . “Now it belongs to history. It will be cleared up and replaced by olive groves.”"
2020-12-18T12:00:08Z,What did Santa bring us? Two Syrian refugees,"We were halfway through the annual game of pass-the-orange-under-the-chin when I realised that Christmas was going to be OK. No, not just OK, better. My Dundonian mother is pretty competitive when it comes to our traditional Christmas games – no one flips a kipper further or faster. Yet there she was, standing between Mohammed and Ayman and taking significantly longer than usual to retrieve the orange from beneath the chin of one of our Syrian guests before passing it securely to the next. “Are you all right there, Ma?” “I’m fine, thank you. You worry about your own team.” My team managed to transport the orange up and down our line of 12 people without the use of hands and won. My mother didn’t seem that bothered. The gathering of clans for our family Christmas is never a small affair. Health and travel arrangements allowing, we usually number 20-plus Haningtons and Scotts, plus in-laws. In 2017 our numbers were swollen still further, thanks to the addition of Mohammed and Ayman and a couple of their friends. I had been anxious about Christmas. We are not a particularly religious family, but certain things are non-negotiable. We always have to watch the four Christmas classics: Scrooged; It’s a Wonderful Life; The Grinch; and Home Alone 2. We all write a letter to Father Christmas, regardless of whether or not we believe in him. And we all go to midnight mass and sing our lungs out, regardless of … see previous. I worried about whether our guests, both of whom are Muslim, would fit in. I worried about whether they would want to. We had been hosting refugees like Mohammed and Ayman for just shy of a year. We decided to do it because it was something we could do. We live in a big house in a part of London with a park and woodlands, pubs and a decent high street. In short, we are very lucky, and once it became clear that both our children were heading to Glasgow for study and work, it seemed like time to share some of that good luck with people who had enjoyed very little. My wife took the lead, contacting Refugees at Home, a charity that essentially provides a matchmaking service, connecting refugees who need temporary accommodation with families or individuals who are willing to host them. The minimum requirement is that you can offer a room in your house and a shelf in the fridge where your guest can store their food. In practice, of course, you end up sharing much more than that. The proof of that came in many forms that Christmas, including a pudding-shaped starter made entirely of rice-stuffed vine leaves. Usually, everyone takes responsibility for bringing some of the food for our annual get-together. Snacks, starters, multiple main courses, cheeses, booze, puddings and indigestion tablets – everyone brings something. This year, Mohammed and Ayman suggested we do it differently. If we all donated a few quid, they would ask their friend Mo Rahimeh, the man behind a pop-up restaurant called Mo’s Eggs, to help them give the whole occasion a Syrian flavour. Mo can make an egg taste better than any egg has a right to taste, but with Ayman and Mohammed’s help he went further. Freshly baked flatbread with homemade hummus and a smoky baba ganoush. Syrian rice with roast chicken, eggs cooked in half a dozen different ways including the “jungle eggs” that he had created when he was in the camp outside Calais. Plus, of course, the stuffed vine-leaf creation, which looked more like an artwork than an entrée. Bread was broken and stories were told. The young Syrians talked openly to interested family members about the ordeals they had gone through in order to reach the UK. I had spoken to them, and to other refugees we had met, about their journeys across Africa and Europe as part of the research for a book I was writing and had come to realise that, if anything, we underestimate the horror. In between the stories, everyone took turns on Spotify, and the result was an interesting mash-up of Motown, Fairouz, Slade, Sabah Fakhri and Bob Dylan’s Christmas album. The day and night-long celebration culminated with some more games, guitars and harmonica and jokes, some of which were easier to translate than others. Someone read an extract from Dickens’ Christmas Carol, someone else read some Dylan Thomas. Finally, Ayman stood and recited The Damascene Poem by Nizar Qabbani. He spoke in Arabic and then in English. “I am a Damascene If you dissect me into halves You will have but grapes and apples Falling in your path.” It was a hard act to follow and, wisely, no one tried. Better to sit and acknowledge the many gifts these young guys from Damascus had brought us.

2020-12-07T07:00:32Z,'Game-changer': £1m pledged to help refugees resettle in UK,"A US-based foundation has pledged £1m to help encourage communities across the UK to resettle hundreds more refugee families. The money from The Shapiro Foundation will be used to support the community sponsorship scheme, which enables grassroots groups to offer a home to refugees who are in greatest need, including survivors of violence and torture, and people requiring urgent medical treatment. Since its launch in 2016, community sponsorship groups have resettled 449 refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. One of the triumphs of community sponsorship has been its success in offering families sanctuary in parts of the UK not previously regarded as obvious places for refugees to resettle such as remote rural areas. The Covid crisis has caused UK resettlement schemes to stall but the hope is that the Shapiro Foundation funds will help give the grassroots movement new impetus. The Rev Canon Karen Rooms, the chair of trustees of Citizens UK, whose Sponsor Refugees arm helps communities set up local schemes, described the Shapiro fund as a “game-changer”. She said: “It will enable us, and other charities, to take the number of local community sponsorship groups we support to another level, safe in the knowledge that there is financial support available should a serious problem arise.” The fund was launched on Sunday night by Ed Shapiro, managing trustee of The Shapiro Foundation, at an event organised by Citizens UK called the Refugees Still Welcome Assembly. The gathering of 500 community leaders from across the UK celebrated the partnership between civil society, national government and local councils that resettled 20,000 refugees since 2015. In response to the Syrian crisis, the UK government launched the vulnerable persons relocation scheme for Syrian nationals, aiming to bring in 20,000 refugees by 2020. By October, more than 19,750 people had been brought in. At the time of the launch of the government scheme, groups such as Citizens UK campaigned for local groups to play a bigger role in resettling refugees and the community sponsorship was created. Citizens UK has called on the UK government to build on the vulnerable persons scheme by resettling a further 25,000 refugees by 2025. The new UK community sponsorship backstop fund could enable 200 new local groups to resettle approximately 1,000 additional refugees in the UK. Ed Shapiro said: “My family has been directly involved in sponsoring Syrian refugees in our own community, Boston, for the past four years and can testify to the difference it makes – not just transforming the lives of a Syrian family, but transforming the community too. “We have been inspired by the humanity of hundreds of people in neighbourhoods across Britain who have already sponsored a refugee family, and now we want to see hundreds more take up the community sponsorship challenge in the years to come. We are also hopeful that the UK will serve as a model for the global expansion of community sponsorship, including the US in 2021.” The backstop fund will reduce the financial exposure of lead sponsor charities in the event that a local community sponsorship group being unable to fulfil its resettlement plan for the refugee family they have welcomed. This will allow lead sponsors such as Citizens UK support a further 200 community sponsorship applications with substantial resources available as a last resort if a local group runs into difficulties."
2020-12-10T19:27:22Z,UK to deny asylum to refugees passing through 'safe' third country,"Ministers have quietly changed immigration rules to prevent people fleeing war or persecution from claiming asylum in the UK if they have passed through a “safe” third country, prompting accusations of a breach of international law. From 1 January, claims of asylum from a person who has travelled through or has a connection to a safe third country, including people coming from EU member states, will be treated as inadmissible. The changes will also prevent asylum seekers from being able to make a claim in the territorial waters of the UK. The UK government will be able to remove refused asylum seekers not only to the third countries through which they have travelled, but to any safe third country that may agree to receive them, an explanatory memo states. A 10-page statement outlining the changes to the rules was published online without a press or public announcement. However, the changes highlight a significant hurdle for the UK government: claims will only be treated as inadmissible if the asylum applicant is accepted for readmission by the third country through which they have travelled or another safe state agrees to take them. Immigration law experts have said this could render the new policy “pointless” and would most likely delay asylum applications and leave refugees in limbo in the UK. Colin Yeo, a leading immigration barrister with expertise in asylum law, wrote on Twitter: “The policy is pointless because the govt has negotiated no such return agreements, so all it does is delay decisions on all claims, which is cruel to genuine refugees, and delay removal of non genuine cases.” The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said the changes were “yet another breach of international law”. He said: “The UK has a proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need, but now the Conservative government is turning its back on refugees. This latest nasty policy from [the home secretary] Priti Patel goes against our commitments under the refugee convention and against everything the UK stands for. It’s yet another breach of international law by this irresponsible tory government.” Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage International, a charity that help refugees access safe and legal routes to asylum, said: “The government’s changes to the immigration rules are a direct assault on the fundamental human right to asylum. These chilling changes on International Human Rights Day do a disservice to the UK’s proud record of providing safety to those fleeing persecution and violence.” The number of small boat arrivals across the Channel has surged to record levels this year, with more than 8,000 migrants and refugees travelling across the Dover Strait, compared with less than 2,000 in 2019. However, total asylum applications are down year on year as the Covid-19 pandemic has cut off other methods of travel and limited migration flows. Patel has been accused of responding haphazardly with kneejerk proposals ranging from sending asylum seekers thousands of miles away to islands in the South Atlantic, to using giant water cannons to repel boats. The prime minister has reportedly become frustrated with Patel’s handling of the situation. The UK is a party to the UN’s 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and to its 1967 protocol, a piece of international law designed to protect refugees. The Home Office provided a statement through the immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp. He said: “We are determined to fix the broken asylum system to make it firm on those who come here through illegally facilitated routes and fair on those who play by the rules. There is no reason to leave a safe country like France to make a dangerous crossing. These measures send a clear message and are just one of the steps the government is taking to tackle the unacceptable rise in small boat crossings.”"
2020-10-29T13:30:51Z,"Canary Islands under pressure as 11,000 migrants arrive in 2020","Spain’s migration secretary has acknowledged that the Canary Islands are struggling to cope with the arrival of more than 11,000 people so far this year, but says the government is working to increase reception capacity, manage migration and stop people dying at sea. The Spanish archipelago, which lies off the coast of north-west Africa, has experienced a massive rise in arrivals compared with last year, which has left resources strained, people sleeping on docks, and the regional government saying it has been overwhelmed. According to figures from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 11,006 people have arrived in the Canaries since January this year, with 4,925 arrivals in October alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. An estimated 414 people have died trying to reach the Canaries so far this year – almost double the 210 fatalities recorded in 2019. On Saturday, at least 140 people died after a boat bound for the Canaries caught fire and then capsized off Senegal’s northwest coast. Migration experts believe the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe has been reactivated by smuggling groups in response to socio-economic factors and conflict in west Africa, while Covid-related measures and border closures have made it more difficult for some migrants to use other routes to Europe. Hana Jalloul, who became secretary of state for migration in Spain’s Socialist-led coalition in January, told the Guardian the arrivals were putting the Canaries’ infrastructure under the kind of pressure not seen for years. “To give you an idea, we’ve had the same number of arrivals over the course of a single week that we had over the whole of last year,” she said. In February, the migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. At the moment, however, the ministry is working with others to try to provide shelter to the new arrivals. “It’s true there are quite a few NGOs helping the migrants who’ve arrived and things are a bit overwhelming at the moment,” said Jalloul. She said the the pressure of the continuing new arrivals had been compounded by the need to hand back the schools and sports centres that had sheltered migrants as the new academic year began, adding: “We’ve had to do all that in record time but I think we’ve handled it well because we’ve been doing PCR tests on the migrants who then go into the reception system.” While the situation pales in comparison with 2006, when 31,000 migrants arrived in the Canaries, Jalloul said it underscored the need for an intelligent and multilateral approach to people-flows. “Migration is a historical fact and one that’s not going to stop because of a pandemic or an economic crisis,” she said. “It’s clear that everyone realises that we won’t be able to deal with this phenomenon unless we work in countries of origin. But we also need to focus on the mafias who abuse these people and push a dream that ends in death at sea.” The IOM said Saturday’s accident was the deadliest shipwreck logged this year. It called for “unity between governments, partners and the international community to dismantle trafficking and smuggling networks that take advantage of desperate youth”. The Senegalese government said its navy had rescued more than 388 people at sea over a two-week period this month, adding that it regretted “the resurgence of clandestine emigration by sea”. Much of Spain’s current diplomatic focus is on dealing with migration at source. “We’re putting a lot of emphasis on working jointly with countries of origin and transit to fight against clandestine migration by improving these countries’ capacity for managing migration,” said one diplomatic source. The message, added the source, was “zero tolerance” for people-traffickers and for those trying to bypass the correct channels to enter Spain – “what’s irregular is irregular, and we won’t accept it”. Jalloul said properly managed migration was essential to Europe as an “ageing continent” and one that celebrated social and cultural diversity. “We don’t see migration as a problem at all: we see people dying at sea as a problem and the existence of the mafias as a problem. That’s where we need to work, but migration per se is not a problem for us.” She also pointed out that the pandemic had revealed Spain’s dependence on people born overseas. “There’s nothing like being fragile to show you how much others can help,” said Jalloul. “The migrants who come here help us – and they’ve shown that in the time of Covid. The migrants are the ones who have looked after people at home and in care homes. And we’ve got migrants who were looked after by the state as children going into the countryside to lend a hand now that they’re 18 or 21.” Jalloul, who visited the Canary Islands in February, said prejudice and stereotypes often masked the incredible lengths to which people would go to escape poverty and violence. “How can you generalise about so many people who’ve had such different life trajectories and many of whom have suffered hugely to get here?” she said. “Many of them have been raped or mutilated, or are parents who have done everything they could for their children. In the Canaries, I met a woman who had given birth to a dead son on a small boat and who was stuck on that boat with her dead son. These people have gone through incredible hardship and sacrifice to give their children a future, as any parent would.”"
2020-10-28T12:53:07Z,EU accused of abandoning migrants to the sea with shift to drone surveillance,"The EU has been accused of condemning migrants to death by critics of its recent €100m (£90m) deals for drone surveillance over the Mediterranean Sea. Campaigners and MEPs have accused the EU’s border agency Frontex of investing in technology to monitor migrants from afar and skirt its responsibilities towards people in distress. Frontex is already under fire after an investigation last week accused it of complicity in often dangerous pushbacks aimed at preventing asylum seekers crossing the Aegean Sea. The agency has denied knowledge of, or involvement in, pushbacks. On Tuesday it launched an internal inquiry, pushed for by EU commissioner Ylva Johansson after reports in the Guardian, but said it had yet to find any evidence of violations. Wim Zwijnenburg, who works on disarmament for the Dutch peace organisation Pax, said EU policymakers had developed a “technology fetish” about watching its borders. “Are they putting the same amount of money into responding?” he said. “Are we going to now have more cameras in the sky to watch people drown in the Mediterranean? “We have all these eyes in the sky, but we don’t have hands on the sea.” Earlier this month Frontex awarded contracts to Airbus and Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems for military-grade drones to monitor “every sea craft involved in any form of irregular or illegal activities at sea”. The EU has said air surveillance helps save lives. But in June a group of migrant rescue NGOs released a report claiming Europe’s air operations had led to tens of thousands of people being taken into custody by the Libyan coastguard, while the EU ended its own sea patrols. “European actors are trying to withdraw their presence in the sea and, we would argue, to not abide by their duties,” said Kiri Santer, from Alarm Phone, one of the NGOs behind the report. “They continue to be present but from the air, so they can be aware of different migrant boats leaving from the Libyan shores and feed that information to the Libyan coastguard,” she said. The new drone operations, expected to launch next year, will allow Frontex to view almost real-time surveillance from bases between Greece, Italy and Malta. Oliver Nuffer, sales head for Airbus’s defence wing, said Frontex was its first nonmilitary client. The firm will be operating the Israeli Heron 1 aircraft, equipped with infrared cameras and maritime radars. “In spring, potentially the refugees are crossing again the Mediterranean Sea and Frontex would like to have a closer look at this kind of situation. But in general it is maritime surveillance,” he said. Airbus hoped the contract would lead to more civilian partnerships. Although the technology has been developed for the military, the unarmed drones provide daylong flights that would change how Frontex is able to monitor the sea, said Nuffer. Elbit will also operate drones. It has previously used the Hermes 900 in tests for the EU. Both types of drones have been deployed in combat situations, mostly in Gaza, but will be unarmed. German MEP Özlem Demirel, who has repeatedly questioned the EU commission since the tender was issued a year ago, said it was “scandalous” to be equipping Europe’s border forces with the technology. “The EU’s external border is increasingly militarised, because surveillance drones are primarily military technology,” she said. Demirel also criticised the EU’s partnership with the Libyan coastguard, which it has funded and trained, despite criticism of its connection to militias and accusations of involvement in trafficking. Frontex’s budget increased to €460m this year, up from €333m last year and €142m in 2015, as Europe focuses more on policing its borders. It issued tenders last year for mobile surveillance systems with infrared cameras and radars that could be mounted on pickup vehicles and vans to detect cross-border movement."
2020-11-26T07:30:51Z,Qatar firms’ failure to pay leaves migrant workers destitute – report,"Companies in Qatar have failed to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars” in salaries and other benefits to low-wage workers since the coronavirus outbreak, according to new research by the human rights group Equidem. In its report, Equidem describes how thousands of workers have been dismissed without notice, put on reduced wages or unpaid leave, denied outstanding salary and end of service payments, or forced to pay for their own flights home. The report’s findings appear to amount to “wage theft” on an unprecedented scale, leaving “worker after worker” destitute, short of food and unable to send money home during the pandemic, in one of the richest countries in the world. “I came here to work for my family, not to be a beggar living on my own,” said a cleaner from Bangladesh, who said he had not received his salary for four months. In separate research, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre found that unpaid or delayed wages were cited by workers in 87% of cases of alleged labour abuse affecting almost 12,000 workers since 2016. Around 2 million migrant workers – mostly from south Asia – work in Qatar, many on construction projects related to the 2022 World Cup. Equidem praises some measures put in place by the Qatar government during the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the government made it mandatory for companies to continue to pay workers in quarantine or government-imposed isolation, and set up a £625m loan scheme to help companies do so, but the report warns of “widespread failure to comply” with this and other regulations. The government later permitted companies that had stopped operating due to Covid restrictions to put workers on unpaid leave or terminate their contracts as long as they complied with requirements of the labour law, including giving a notice period and paying outstanding benefits. The report highlights a number of companies that exploited or ignored this directive. Up to 2,000 workers employed by one construction company were laid off on the spot, workers claim. Most did not receive their outstanding salary or end of service settlement, a payment equivalent to three weeks’ salary for each full year of work. “Many migrant workers are in an extremely vulnerable position with no real ability to assert their rights or seek remedy for violations,” says the report. Mustafa Qadri, the director of Equidem, said the lack of a lawful right to organise or join a trade union has been particularly damaging. “It has prevented workers from having a seat at the table with government and employers to negotiate an equitable share of funds,” he said. The report describes similar findings in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as policies in response to the pandemic which amount to racial discrimination. In both countries, the authorities required private companies to continue to provide wages and benefits to nationals, but allowed them to reduce wages or stop paying non-nationals. In a statement, the Qatar government said its response to the pandemic, “has been driven by the highest international standards of public health policy and the protection of human rights”. The government has provided free testing and treatment and said, “employers failing to pay their staff on time or withholding end of service payments have faced disciplinary action, including heavy fines and bans that prevent them from operating”."
2021-01-01T07:15:03Z,Tributes paid to Ethiopian refugee farmer who championed integration in Italy,"Tributes have been paid to a 42-year-old Ethiopian refugee and farmer who became a symbol of integration in Italy, her adopted home. Agitu Ideo Gudeta was attacked and killed, allegedly by a former employee, on her farm in Trentino on Wednesday. Gudeta had left Addis Ababa in 2010 after angering the authorities by taking part in protests against “land grabbing”. Once in Italy, she tenaciously followed and realised her ambition to move to the mountains and start her own farm. Taking advantage of permits that give farmers access to abandoned public land in depopulated areas, she reclaimed 11 hectares (27 acres) around an old barn in the Mòcheni valley, where she founded her La Capra Felice (The Happy Goat) enterprise. Gudeta started with a herd of 15 goats, quickly rising to 180 in a few years, producing organic milk and cheese using environmentally friendly methods and hiring migrants and refugees. “I created my space and made myself known, there was no resistance to me,” she told Reuters news agency that year. “Agitu brought to Italy the dream she was unable to realise in Ethiopia, in part because of land grabbing,” Gabriella Ghermandi, singer, performer, novelist and friend of Gudeta, told the Guardian. “Her farm was successful because she applied what she had learned from her grandparents in the countryside. “In Italy, many people have described her enterprise as a model of integration. But Agitu’s dream was to create an environmentally sustainable farm that was more than just a business; for her it also symbolised struggle against class divisions and the conviction that living in harmony with nature was possible. And above all she carried out her work with love. She had given a name to each one of her goats.” In a climate where hostility toward migrants was increasing, led by far-right political leaders, her success story was reported by numerous media outlets as an example of how integration can benefit communities. “The most rewarding satisfaction is when people tell me how much they love my cheeses because they’re good and taste different,” she said in an interview with Internazionale in 2017. “It compensates for all the hard work and the prejudices I’ve had to overcome as a woman and an immigrant.” Two years ago she received death threats and was the target of racist attacks, which she reported to police, recounting them on her social media posts. But police said a man who has confessed to the rape and murder of the farmer was an ex-employee who, they said, allegedly acted for “economic reasons”. The UN refugee agency said it was “pained” by Gudeta’s death, and that her entrepreneurial spirit “demonstrated how refugees can contribute to the societies that host them”. “Despite her tragic end, the UNHCR hopes that Agitu Ideo Gudeta will be remembered and celebrated as a model of success and integration and inspire refugees that struggle to rebuild their lives,” the agency said. “We spoke on the phone last week’’, said Ghermandi. “We spent two hours speaking about Ethiopia. We had plans to get together in the spring. Agitu considered Italy her home. She used to say that she had suffered too much in Ethiopia. Now Agitu is gone, but her work mustn’t die. We will soon begin a fundraising campaign to follow her plan for expanding the business so that her dream will live on.” Gudeta would have turned 43 on New Year’s Day."
2021-01-01T11:39:32Z,World leaders urged to make Covid vaccine available to millions of refugees,"Global humanitarian figures and NGOs have urged world leaders to urgently make Covid-19 vaccinations available to millions of refugees and others displaced by war, as the pandemic continues to overwhelm some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. The impact of the contagion has sharply intensified across the Middle East in recent weeks, matching soaring global numbers. However, it has been further amplified by drastically underresourced medical responses that cannot cope with the numbers of dying or seriously ill. In northern Syria and Iraq, where millions of people remain displaced or in internment camps, images of vaccines being administered in the US and UK have heightened fears that the collective efforts of global scientists will be focused on developed societies. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has pleaded for the vaccines being rolled out across the globe to be made available to “all people” and that their distribution must be viewed as a “global public good”. His comments followed mounting concerns that a scheme to deliver Covid vaccines to poorer countries faces a high risk of failure and could leave at least half the planet without vaccinations for at least the next three years. The World Health Organization (WHO) is administering the rollout to poorer nations and said it aims to have 2 billion people vaccinated by the end of 2021. However, the target has been described by senior UN officials as ambitious and unlikely to be met without a serious upscaling of resources and political mobilisation. The UN’s refugee body, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have added weight to the concerns, imploring that refugees and migrants are included in governments’ vaccine allocations. “In these times of pandemic and beyond, [we] … stand ready to support governments in their efforts to make health care available for all, through universal health coverage, a reality,” said IOM director general António Vitorino. “Access to health is a fundamental right, but too often still those who need it the most – including migrants and forcibly displaced persons – are left out. If 2020 has taught us something, it is that ill health is a universal issue that does not distinguish based on nationality; so, to be truly effective, neither should our health coverage, including in upcoming Covid-19 vaccination efforts.” Mercy Corps, an international aid agency, said significant difficulties already existed in delivering basic necessities to places such as Yemen and Syria, where needs for a vaccine are great. “The risks and challenges ahead aren’t limited to vaccine supplies or maintaining a cold chain,” said the organisation’s chief executive, Tjada D’Oyen McKenna. “In conflict zones and places hosting refugees and internally displaced people, vaccines are likely to become yet another scarce resource that is contested – with the potential for escalating tension and conflict as a result. “The international community must ensure through diplomatic pressure and on-the-ground support that vaccines reach all communities, including the most vulnerable and marginalised, in ways that prevent grievances and conflict. “We also urgently need donors and governments to fund trusted community organisations to begin the outreach work now to ensure that misinformation is tackled and communities accept a vaccine when it does arrive. If we don’t act together as a global community, we risk leaving an entire generation of the most vulnerable behind.” UNHCR said it has managed to maintain infection rates among forcibly displaced communities at comparable levels to local populations. However, official numbers of infections provided by governments in countries such as Syria are widely believed to be an extreme underestimation. Senior members of the UN system fear that the distribution of vaccines will become a political tool, as have other forms of aid, such as food and medicine. Host governments are likely to be the primary means of entry of the vaccine. Throughout the Syrian war, communities that have remained outside the control of the Assad regime have been routinely denied access to lifesaving essentials. Iraq’s displaced communities have had a similar experience. “I don’t think we will get this vaccine as internally displaced people in the camps because we need a representative to source it for us,” said Mahmoud Sleiman, a resident of the Hassan Sham camp in northern Iraq. “In our case it is the government that should order for us, and I doubt they will get it in time. Even if they do, there will be corruption in the process and only rich people will get it. Poor people like me never will.” UNHCR said global numbers of forced displacement crossed the 80 million mark in the middle of 2020. More than 50 million people were internally displaced, with potentially less access to international aid than those who had made it across international borders. “My cousin got to Turkey and he says the Turks may get to him and his family in March,” said Ghassan Abbad, a Syrian who fled to Idlib province from government-controlled Damascus in 2016. “But here, only God can help us. There are so many dead and dying here. The curse has come to us, and nothing can lift it for many more months.” Khalid Murad, a Yazidi member of a camp in the Kurdish north of Iraq, said time was against refugees and displaced people, who saw no real hope coming. “I don’t think this vaccine is only for the west but I think it will take a long time for Iraqi people to receive it. If Iraq receives the vaccine we will also get it, despite the fact that they don’t consider Yazidis as Iraqis. But under international pressure it will come to us eventually.” Additional reporting by Nechirvan Mando"
2020-09-28T06:00:05Z,"Create safe, legal routes for refugee families to reunite in UK, stars urge PM","Some of Britain’s biggest cultural stars, including Olivia Colman, Michaela Coel and Stephen Fry, are calling on the government to establish safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to reach the UK. More than 70 high-profile actors, musicians, comedians, artists and sports players have sent a letter, seen by the Guardian, to the prime minister demanding a change to the UK’s restrictive refugee family reunion laws. Current rules only allow adult refugees to apply for their spouses or children under 18 to join them; children recognised as refugees in the UK can not apply for their parents or siblings aged over 18 to accompany them. Patrick Stewart, Chiwetel Ejiofor, the band Coldplay, Jessie Ware and Gary Lineker are also among the 70-plus celebrities to back the Families Together coalition, which includes among others Amnesty International UK, British Red Cross, Refugee Council and the UN Refugee Agency, in calling for a relaxation of this rule. The coalition has launched a new petition on the issue. Lineker told the Guardian: “There are children in the UK right now who have fled war and persecution and have no hope of seeing their parents or siblings again. We should be offering them support and compassion. A simple change to the rules could be transformational.” Helen Mirren, Joanna Lumley, Adrian Lester, Kate Moss, Riz Ahmed and Nish Kumar are among the other signatories to the letter. It reads: “For some children in the UK, being kept apart from the parents they so desperately need is an everyday reality – pandemic or not. “These children are vulnerable. They have been recognised as refugees by our government, having fled war or persecution – dangers and horrors most of us will never be able to imagine. “But the UK’s current refugee family reunion rules say that these vulnerable child refugees cannot be reunited with their family members.” The action comes at a time of increased tension over the UK’s asylum policy. Nearly 7,000 migrants have arrived in the UK in small boats across the Channel so far this year, more than three times the number of arrivals in the whole of 2019. Humanitarian groups and migration experts have been calling for safe and legal routes to be established to reduce the number of people risking their lives at sea to reach the UK. The government could consider strengthening existing family reunion rules, provide places for child refugees under the so-called Dubs scheme, or develop humanitarian visas that would give people advance permission to enter the UK to claim asylum. But the government is persisting with a hardline approach to the arrivals in an attempt to make the route across the Channel “unviable”. Over the summer, RAF aircraft were launched over the Dover Strait to assist Border Force, which Labour said was an attempt to “militarise a response to a humanitarian crisis”. Merhawi Hagos, 18, a refugee from Eritrea, said: “I was separated from my mother when I was 14 years old. I had an extremely difficult asylum journey to come to the UK and thankfully I was granted refugee status two years ago. “But I found the experience of living without a family to be unbearable and a situation I would not wish upon anyone. I struggle to lead a normal life: cannot plan, cannot focus on my studies or work. I feel lonely, and depressed and do not sleep well. “My family are in a refugee camp in Ethiopia. The camp is not secure and safe. I’m imploring the UK government to change the family reunion rules so that young refugees like myself can be together with their families in the UK.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Government provides a safe and legal route to bring families together through its refugee family reunion policy. Last year 7,482 family reunion visas were issued to partners and children of those previously granted asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK, 37% more than the previous year. “By allowing children to sponsor their parents, we would risk giving unscrupulous criminal gangs an incentive to split families and send children on dangerous journeys to the UK alone.”"
2020-08-28T09:45:42Z,Minister downplays concerns Australia's Covid crisis has hit multicultural communities harder,"Alan Tudge has questioned whether the Covid-19 health crisis has hit multicultural communities harder, but conceded the economic impact has been “tougher for some families” due to their exclusion from welfare. The population, acting immigration and multicultural affairs minister made the comments at the National Press Club on Friday, after a speech claiming more free English classes and testing prospective citizens on Australian values would boost “social cohesion”. Tudge also made the case for a return to population growth through migration to boost the economy and added his voice to a chorus of government ministers urging states to ease border restrictions. Asked if the federal government takes any responsibility for the differential impact of Covid-19 and the recession on culturally and linguistically diverse (Cald) communities, Tudge replied: “You’re putting forward a position to me that it’s greatly different. “And, you’re right, in Melbourne the highest case numbers are in the north and west [but] there are lower case numbers over in the east, and south-east where I live, and I live in a very multicultural community.” Tudge noted that case numbers were “very small” in Sydney despite a “very multicultural community”. “The reason why the infection rate is higher in Victoria is not because of any particular demographic, it’s because there were failures in the quarantining system and failures in the tracing system.” The second-wave outbreak of coronavirus in Melbourne is concentrated in the north and west, which have a higher proportion of people from lower socio-economic and Cald backgrounds. The Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said the state is not doing enough to reach Cald communities. The Covid-19 Health and Research Advisory Committee has noted that members of multicultural communities are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases and less likely to engage with public health messages. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners spokesperson Dr Kate Walker has said that GPs have found “Cald patients are bearing the brunt of the pandemic” – including from delaying healthcare. “We are hearing of vulnerable patients who’ve lost work and are under a great deal of stress, GPs are seeing increased mental health symptoms, isolation and loneliness,” she said. Due to a large outbreak at the St Basil’s aged care home, Greek Australians are overrepresented in the number of deaths of Covid-19. Research commissioned by the Refugee Council of Australia has found unemployment among refugees and asylum seekers is expected to double from 19% to 42%. Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the chief executive officer of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia, told Guardian Australia it had called for a multicultural strategy to tackle Covid-19, which “wasn’t done” – resulting in delays in translating health materials. “Migrant communities were being greatly affected,” he said. “There was a vacuum created for a few months, where many migrant communities sought coronavirus information in their language from outside media, from back home, from their WhatsApp channels.” “[Temporary visa-holders] don’t have access to jobkeeper or jobseeker. “We know they were the first ones to access their super, the first to go to food banks to get assistance. “They had no means to pay for flights back home, or can’t go back because the borders are closed – it created a situation of people in limbo and potentially in destitution.” Al-Khafaji said exclusion from economic supports had led to some continuing to work in crowded abattoirs, chicken factories and multiple aged care centres. Tudge accepted exclusion from economic supports had a “differential impact” on “foreign nationals” who he said knew when they came to Australia “you don’t get access to welfare if you lose your job, and if you’re on an employer-sponsored visa, for example, unfortunately you have to leave the country”. “It’s been tougher for some families, I really feel for some families, don’t get me wrong, [people who have] been here for three years out of four-year visas and may have been on a pathway to permanent residency. “But we have to prioritise Australian citizens and residents in this pandemic … In terms of our welfare dollar, jobs that are available … and we make no apology for that.” Tudge said the government would undertake a campaign to encourage permanent residents to take up citizenship, and announced it would update the citizenship test to “include new questions on Australian values”. Limits on the existing English language courses for adult migrants will be reformed so migrants can access more than 510 hours. Tudge said Australia’s migrant intake was “down 85% on what was initially anticipated”, but did not update figures estimating just 31,000 migrants would come to Australia in 2020-21. He praised migration for adding to gross domestic product, both nationally and per capita, citing Treasury estimates that 20% of GDP per capita growth had come from a larger population. “We’re bringing young skilled migrants, average age 26, they come here and they work – they help the participation rate, they help the productivity rate. “So we’ll need to get back to being an immigrant country at some stage, but clearly we need to this carefully, we need to do this safely.” Tudge also added to pressure on state premiers to ease border restrictions. He cited the case of a Ballina woman pregnant with twins forced to fly to Sydney rather than go to Brisbane for emergency treatment. One of the babies died. Earlier, at the Daily Telegraph bush summit in Cooma, Scott Morrison called on premiers to set aside their differences and come up with workable solutions to allow movement without compromising health. Morrison invoked federation, claiming Australia “was not built to have internal borders”. “That was the point of Australia,” he said. “That was plan A – I’m for plan A.” He clarified that he wasn’t calling for “no restrictions” but that restrictions shouldn’t impinge on people moving from one Covid-free area of the country to another. Morrison reiterated plans to develop a national cabinet definition of hotspot, warning the commonwealth is prepared to go it alone if agreement is not reached, which would force premiers to defend their own policies in the face of contrary health advice. Queensland has declared jurisdictions with no community transmission hotspots, and, in the case of the Australian Capital Territory, no active cases. Western Australia has maintained its border ban despite the federal court finding the risk from the ACT, Northern Territory and South Australia is “low” and “very low” from Tasmania."
2020-06-16T16:48:31Z,The refugee standup night: 'none of us can believe how successful it is',"‘Let me tell you something more about my miserable life,” says Usman Khalid, with a miserable face. Then he pauses, and twinkles: “That’s why you’re here, isn’t it?” Well, why would you go to see refugees performing standup comedy? Displacement, migration, sanctuary – these are not hilarious subjects. If we think about them at all, it’s usually with bleeding hearts. Or worse. “The media discourse,” says comedian Tom Parry, “is, ‘Oh these poor refugees, they need our help’, or ‘God, these refugees coming over here [and sponging off us]’… But both responses are dehumanising. Whereas there’s nothing more human than laughing with someone.” Parry – of the sketch trio, Pappy’s, and award-nominated for his solo work – is coach to No Direction Home, a collective of refugees and migrants learning standup comedy. It’s Refugee Week this week, and the outfit are presenting three gigs, the third with Nish Kumar headlining. Parry gets his mates involved, and those big-name headliners – Romesh Ranganathan fronted their Southbank Centre gala last summer – lead masterclasses for participants, too. The programme is thriving in the age of Zoom, on which Parry now leads three weekly workshops to a burgeoning intake. “None of us,” he says, “can believe how successful it’s been.” I can vouch for that: I played a role in bringing No Direction Home into being. In 2018, the venue I co-run, Camden People’s Theatre, staged a festival of performances about refugeeism. We made contact with the charity Counterpoints Arts, scoping how we might work together. They suggested a standup course or event – for which they perceived a hunger among their migrant and refugee community. “But what we needed was somebody to run the workshops,” says Tom Green, who produces No Direction Home for Counterpoints. “That person was going to be crucial.” I invited Parry – a director as well as a sketch and standup act – to come onboard. A call-out was duly circulated. “And straight away we had eight or 10 people,” says Green. “They were very shy to begin with – but they really wanted to do it.” I attended the first workshop, where, skilfully encouraged by Parry, these amateur clowns from Iran, Somalia, Sudan and beyond took their first steps in comedy. “Tom told them, ‘Don’t try to be funny. Try to be interesting,’” Green remembers. “And what we definitely have in the group are a lot of really interesting people.” “After that first session,” says Parry, “I just knew: this is really going to work.” A few weeks later, I was at the first gig, too, at CPT – and, like everyone else present, I was blindsided by how good it was. Khalid was on the bill, a refugee from Pakistan with his own coffee-shop business and an expert line in hangdog humour. So, too, giggling self-deprecator Majid Adin, whose satirical illustrations precipitated his flight from Iran. Tewodros Aregawe, who fled Eritrea as a teenager, losing friends on the Mediterranean crossing, had since become a performer with the theatre company, Phosphoros. His cocksure standup was a first-night highlight. What’s so striking about the group is the wide variety of comic sensibilities, and how capably, after only a few hours’ tuition, they deploy them. “What you get from people who’ve never considered this as a career,” says Green, “is a freshness, a directness and honesty – and a connection with the audience that’s amazing. There’s some really fantastic talent out there. Which raises a broader question about who gets the chance to be a comedian – about who could do it, given the chance.” More than that, No Direction Home bucks the stereotype of the tragic refugee, a figure only ever allowed to be silent and powerless – or grasping and malign. No Direction Home complicates that picture – by blurring the line between refugees and migrants more widely, and allowing them to represent something beyond their own fraught circumstances. “At that first gig alone,” says Green, “we had people talking about dating or food or their grandmother or being bombed in their home country or crossing the Channel. It’s a full range.” Then there’s the fact that, with a microphone in their hand, the performers’ status relationship with their hosts (who has to listen to whom) is momentarily upended. “There’s so many assumptions around who refugees are,” says Green, “that to see people presenting on their own terms about what they choose to talk about is really affecting. The power and agency of that is fantastic.” Says Parry: “The gigs end up feeling like a celebration. They’re really special.” Only 18 months into the programme, the aim now is to keep welcoming newcomers, while supporting those acts with professional ambitions. The collective had secured their first Edinburgh fringe dates this summer – until coronavirus intervened. Selam Mengistu is a second-generation Ethiopian immigrant who took up comedy after seeing No Direction Home at CPT a year ago. On 21 June, she’ll be gigging with Nish Kumar. “It’s always been something I’d wanted to do,” she tells me, “but I was terrified of doing it. I’d never have tried standup at an open-mic night. I only considered this because it was aimed at people from migrant backgrounds, who would not normally have this opportunity.” Now telling her own jokes for a living no longer seems an impossible dream. “I’m not trying to be on Live at the Apollo just yet,” says Mengistu. “But I am interested to see where this might take me.” * No Direction Home are performing online on 16 June with Mo Omar, on 19 June with a yet to be announced headliner, and on 21 June with Nish Kumar."
2020-10-28T18:09:15Z,Canadians increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees – study,"Despite a global pandemic that has destroyed economies and fanned nationalism around the world, Canadians say they are increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees. A new study from the polling firm Environics Institute found that attitudes among Canadians have become increasingly positive, even as millions remain out of work and the country faces grim economic projections. “These views are not a blip. They’re not chance. They seem to be deeply rooted and widely spread,” said Andrew Parkin, executive director at Environics. Since 1976, the Focus Canada survey, administered by Environics, has periodically sampled Canadians to gauge their views on the topic. The latest results, released in early October, show for the first time ever that Canadians are more likely than not to reject the idea that immigrants are not adopting Canadian values. At the same time, a large majority of Canadians continue to see immigrants as critical to the Canadian economy and don’t feel they take jobs away from other Canadians. Close to one-third of Canadians say that too many refugee claimants are not “real” refugees – sharply down from 79% in 1987. Researchers were curious to see if recent world events had dramatically shifted opinion, said Parkin. “At first, we thought maybe Donald Trump would knock these positive trends. Maybe Canadians would catch the vibe of what’s going on in the States and start pulling back. That didn’t happen,” he said. The emergence in 2019 of the anti-immigration People’s Party of Canada also failed to shift opinions. Even the pandemic, which has so far millions of jobs and left Canadians in precarious financial situations, has not turned residents negative towards newcomers. “If these views are not going to get knocked back by politics in the United States or a major health or an economic crisis, they’re probably not going to get knocked back,” he said. The shifting attitudes are not found just in heavily populated and diverse cities like Toronto. Pollsters recorded increasing openness among older residents aligned with conservative political parties and in regions that have faced economic devastation. Parkin pointed to Atlantic Canada, often compared to the US rust belt or northern England – rural areas where industry has left, the population is poorer and residents are older. “In other countries, this all correlates with less openness to immigration. But in Atlantic Canada, they’ve realized that the more immigrants they have, the more businesses that are going to get started there.” Part of this is probably the geographical realities of immigration to Canada. “For years, we’ve essentially had the luxury of being able to choose our immigrants because of where we’re located,” said Parkin, noting that Canada has largely favoured skilled immigrants. At the same time, immigrants and visible minorities often face greater challenges navigating daily life in the country. Members of Canada’s Asian community have reported a significant increase in harassment following the arrival of the coronavirus – experiences corroborated by data from Statistics Canada. And in recent months, leaders across the country have admitted that systemic racism places a heavy – often violent – burden on visible minorities. While the survey results suggest an openness to newcomers, Parkin admits the underlying causes are difficult to determine. Political unrest and xenophobia in America might be a key factor. Instead of Trump’s xenophobic views spilling over the border, Parkin suspects they have had the opposite effect in Canada. “It actually seems to have reinforced our sense of distinctiveness.” The unifying message of the pandemic – that everyone is in the situation together – might have also contributed to this shift, along with the belief that immigrants help the economy. “Increasingly, people see this not as an issue, but a question of identity,” he said. “And Canadians often see themselves as welcoming to people from all over the world.”"
2020-10-21T05:30:27Z,Croatian police accused of 'sickening' assaults on migrants on Balkans trail,"People on the Balkans migrant trail have allegedly been whipped, robbed and, in one case, sexually abused by members of the Croatian police. The Danish Refugee Council (DRC) has documented a series of brutal pushbacks on the Bosnia-Croatian border involving dozens of asylum seekers between 12 and 16 October. The Guardian has obtained photographs and medical reports that support the accounts, described by aid workers as “sickening” and “shocking”. “The testimonies collected from victims of pushbacks are horrifying,’’ said Charlotte Slente, DRC secretary general. “More than 75 persons in one week have all independently reported inhumane treatment, savage beatings and even sexual abuse.’’ According to migrants’ accounts, the pushbacks occurred in Croatian territory over the border from Velika Kladuša in Bosnia, close to Šiljkovača – a tented forest settlement of around 700 refugees and migrants. “All of the persons interviewed by DRC bore visible injuries from beatings (bruises and cuts), as a result of alleged Croatian police violence,” reads the DRC report. “According to the statements provided by interviewed victims (with visible evidence of their injuries), pushbacks included brutal and extremely violent behaviour, degrading treatment, and theft and destruction of personal belongings.” One of the testimonies includes a report of serious sexual abuse. On 12 October, five Afghans, including two minors, crossed the Croatian border near the Šturlić settlement. On the same day, near Novo Selo, an uniformed police officer stopped them and then called two more officers. One of the migrants ran, and the other four were detained at a police station. Two days later they were taken to court, where they say they were to “appear as witnesses in the case launched against the fifth member of the group – the one who escaped”, who had been accused of violent behaviour towards police. The asylum seekers told the DRC that the original officers then took them “to some unknown location, where they were put in a van in the charge of 10 armed people, dressed in black and with full face balaclavas, army boots and with flashlights on their foreheads”. Their money was taken, their belongings torched and they were ordered to strip to their underwear. The migrants allege that they were forced to lie face down on the ground. “One man in black was standing on the victim’s hands, preventing any movements,” reads the report. “Legs were also restrained. Once the person was hampered, the beating started. They were punched, kicked, whipped and beaten.” Medical reports confirm that migrants’ injuries are consistent with the use of a whip. One migrant, MK, says at this point he was sexually assaulted by a man using a branch. Mustafa Hodžić, a doctor in Velika Kladuša, examined the man. “The patient had wounds all over the back of his body, on his back and legs. I can confirm the signs of clear sexual violence … I have never seen anything like it. Even if it isn’t the first time as a doctor [that] I have seen signs of sexual violence on migrants, which, according the asylum seekers’ accounts, were perpetrated on Croatian territory by Croatian officials dressed in black uniforms.” One Pakistani migrant told of being intercepted with two others near Croatia’s Blata railway station. The police allegedly ordered them to strip naked before loading them into a van and taking them to a sort of garage, where five other migrants were waiting to be sent back to Bosnia. Awaiting their arrival were men dressed in black. “They started to beat us with batons, and the third one took his mobile phone and took a selfie with us without clothes,” the Pakistani man said. “The first four of us were on the ground, and we lay next to each other, naked and beaten, and the other four were ordered to lie on us, like when trees are stacked, so we lay motionless for 20 minutes. The last one was a minor. He was from the other group; I saw when the police officer ask him where he was from. He tried to say that he is a minor. He was beaten a lot, and when it was his turn to take off his clothes, he was beaten even more.” One man added: “A minor from the second group fainted after many blows. His friends took him in their arms, and one of the police officers ordered them to lay him down on the ground. Then they started hitting them with batons. Before the deportation, police told us: ‘We don’t care where you are from or if you will return to Bosnia or to your country, but you will not go to Croatia. Now you have all your arms and legs because we were careful how we hit you. Next time it will be worse’.’’ Small groups of asylum seekers attempt to cross from Bosnia into Croatia nightly on the migrant trail into western Europe. The EU’s longest internal border, it is patrolled by police armed with truncheons, pistols and night vision goggles. Aid workers, doctors, border guards and UN officials have documented systematic abuse and violence perpetrated along the border stretch for several years. Last May, the Guardian documented a case of more than 30 migrants who were allegedly robbed and had their heads spray painted with red crosses by Croatian officers. The UNHCR has asked the Croatian government to set up an independent assessment of the border situation. The details of the latest pushback are in a report that the DRC has shared with the European commission, which has yet to investigate. ‘’The Croatian government and the European commission must act to put a stop to the systematic use of violence,” said Slente. ‘’Treating human beings like this, inflicting severe pain and causing unnecessary suffering, irrespective of their migratory status, cannot and should not be accepted by any European country, or by any EU institution. There is an urgent need to ensure that independent border monitoring mechanisms are in place to prevent these abuses.” Croatian police and the ministry of the interior have not responded to requests for comment. In June, the Guardian revealed EU officials were accused of an “outrageous cover-up” for withholding evidence of the Croatian government’s failure to supervise border forces. Internal emails showed Brussels officials were fearful of full disclosure of Croatia’s lack of commitment to a monitoring mechanism that EU ministers had agreed to fund. In January, a commission official warned a colleague that Croatia’s failure to use money earmarked two years ago for border police “will for sure be seen as a scandal”. The recent accusations come as the commission presented its final report on the grant, in which Croatia asserted that the co-financing project had “helped make the implementation of activities of border surveillance more conscientious and of higher quality, with emphasis on the respect of migrants’ rights guaranteed under international, European and national legislation”. Regarding allegations of abuse, Croatian authorities stated: “Every single [piece of] information and every single complaint was inspected in the process called internal control. We did not establish that the police officers committed any criminal or disciplinary offence in any of the cases.” Clare Daly, an Irish MEP, is among those who have raised concerns in Brussels. “The blood of these people, so horrifically mistreated on the Croatian border, is on the hands of the European commission. They have enabled this violation of fundamental rights by ignoring the facts presented to them by NGOs and MEPs that all was not well. They turned a blind eye time and again, and now these horrible events have occurred again, even worse than before.” She added: “The last time such behaviour occurred, the commission rewarded Croatia with an extra grant even bigger than the first one, and said they were happy with how the funds had been spent … when is someone going to be held accountable for these crimes against humanity?”"
2020-08-30T16:03:17Z,Migrant boat bursts into flames off southern Italian coast,"A boat carrying dozens of refugees has burst into flames off the coast of southern Italy as its passengers were being transferred to Italian naval vessels to take them to port. Three people are confirmed dead and three are missing at sea. Six people are in hospital with serious burns injuries, including two Italian officials who were taking the people off the boat. The vessel was approached by an Italian naval ship that was in the process of taking migrants onboard and, according to preliminary reports, suddenly caught fire, most likely because of a fuel leakage, then exploded. The number of victims is still uncertain. Bathers at a beach near Crotone watched dark smoke pour out of the vessel on the sunny Sunday afternoon. Red Cross commissioner Francesco Pascuzzo said: “Four miles from the coast, something caught fire and the boat exploded, causing serious damage. It’s a tragic situation. “Between five and seven migrants are feared missing. Four migrants are in hospital with serious burn injuries, and two rescue workers have suffered injuries. Twelve migrants were transported to a welcome centre.” A reconnaissance plane is searching for survivors at sea. Meanwhile, a boat with 450 migrants onboard was rescued by the Italian coastguard off the island of Lampedusa as it risked capsizing in strong winds. In the last 24 hours, a further 500 migrants have arrived at Lampedusa on small boats, causing a backlash among a portion of the local population. “We’re on our knees,” said Salvatore Martello, mayor of Lampedusa. “The situation is unbearable. Either the government has to take immediate decisions, or the entire island will go on strike.” On Saturday, the UN refugee agency urged European nations to let in hundreds of people rescued from the Mediterranean by humanitarian boats, including one vessel financed by the British street artist Banksy. The UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said more than 200 rescued refugees needed to get off the nonprofit search-and-rescue ship Louise Michel immediately, saying it was far beyond its safe capacity. The plea from UNHCR and IOM also mentioned hundreds of migrants on two other charity ships in urgent need of safe harbour. On Saturday, the Italian coastguard answered a distress call from the Louise Michel, and took charge of 49 of the people who were most in need of help, it said. By late Saturday night, all passengers on the Louise Michel had been transferred to the SeaWatch4, which was left with about 350 people onboard. It was looking for a safe seaport to disembark the passengers. So far in 2020, more than 500 refugees are known to have died in the Mediterranean, and the real number is estimated to be considerably higher."
2020-10-01T19:49:35Z,Thousands of migrants cross into Guatemala with slim hopes of reaching US,"Thousands of Honduran migrants hoping to reach the United States have entered Guatemala, testing the newly reopened frontier that had been shut by the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities had planned to register the migrants as they crossed and offer assistance to those willing to turn back, but early on Thursday, the group pushed past armed guards without registering. By midday more than 3,000 migrants had crossed illegally, said Guatemalan officials. The caravan is the biggest since the coronavirus pandemic hit Central America in March, shutting off travel as well as triggering a rise in unemployment and poverty. Before the crossing happened, Edwin Omar Molino, a 17-year-old from Cortés, said he wanted to leave Honduras because he couldn’t find work. “Even when you want to find a job, there aren’t any. That’s why we leave our country,” Molino said. “There’s the pandemic, and it scares me,” he added. But he said he wouldn’t be able to help his family get ahead without taking the risk. Central American migrants began traveling in large groups in recent years, seeking safety in numbers and in some cases avoiding the cost of smugglers. Calls for a new migrant caravan to leave on 1 October had circulated for weeks on social media. The odds of a large migrant caravan reaching the US border, already low, have grown increasingly slim over the past year. Under pressure from the United States, Mexico deployed its national guard and more immigration agents to break up attempted caravans last year. Actually crossing into the US legally is virtually impossible now with the pandemic, and entering illegally is as difficult as ever. The departure of the new group was reminiscent of a migrant caravan that formed two years ago shortly before US midterm elections. It became a hot issue in the campaign, fueling anti-immigrant rhetoric. But while the caravans draw attention, they account for a small fraction of the daily migration flow by small groups that pass unnoticed through Central America and Mexico. The migrants who arrived at the Guatemala border on Thursday had set out walking the previous night from San Pedro Sula, and many wore masks. They appeared to be mostly young men, though there were the occasional small children being pushed in strollers. Mexico’s immigration agency said in a statement that it would enforce “safe, orderly and legal” migration and not do anything to promote the formation of a caravan. The US embassy in Honduras said on Twitter on Wednesday that migration to the US was more difficult than ever right now – and more dangerous because of the coronavirus. But the factors driving migrants to leave Central America have not eased during the pandemic. As economies have suffered, there are ever fewer jobs to be had, and the struggle for families to put food on the table has only worsened. The UN’s International Labor Organization said on Wednesday that at least 34m jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the pandemic. The ILO lists Latin America and the Caribbean as the worst-hit region in the world in terms of lost working hours, with a drop of 20.9% in the first three quarters of the year. The flow of migrants north from Central America had slowed dramatically during the pandemic as countries throughout the region closed their borders."
2020-10-18T07:00:43Z,From Sudan to the Park Inn: the tragic story of a migrant’s killing,"On the last Friday of June, at about midday, Badreddin Abadlla Adam left his room at the Park Inn hotel in Glasgow, walked down to reception, and stabbed six people. The 28-year-old, an asylum seeker from Sudan who had been placed in the hotel as part of the UK government’s emergency response to the coronavirus pandemic, stabbed and seriously injured three other residents, two staff members and a policeman who arrived on the scene. Adam was shot dead by armed officers shortly afterwards. The incident, which took place as Scotland was still under stringent lockdown, was initially reported by some media outlets as a potential terrorist attack, although police later dismissed this explanation. It was immediately seized on by rightwing activists, to claim that the country was threatened by an influx of “illegal” immigrants. Instead, the Park Inn incident has highlighted the increasingly precarious situation of people who seek a safe haven in the UK, even as the government proposes more severe measures to deter them. Adam is one of three asylum seekers who have died in Glasgow since the start of the pandemic, a series of events that has shocked the city, and left campaigners and politicians calling for a public inquiry. At the end of March, B, a 30-year-old Syrian who spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, was one of several hundred asylum seekers in Glasgow who unexpectedly received a knock on the door. He had been sent to Scotland’s largest city after arriving in the UK the previous autumn. Glasgow hosts about 10% of the 35,000 people who claim asylum in the UK each year, under a policy known as dispersal. Like other recent arrivals, B was living in his own small apartment; a two-room space in a hostel. He had his own bathroom, and he had privacy. At the door, however, was an employee of Mears Group, the Home Office contractor that manages asylum accommodation in Glasgow. “They said, ‘you need to get ready,’” B told the Observer, “‘you’re being moved to a hotel because of coronavirus.’” Across the city, hundreds of others were receiving the same call, as Mears abruptly moved about 350 asylum seekers – for the most part, recent arrivals who were living in temporary accommodation – into six hotels. Parliament heard in June that many received little or no notice, and that among them were pregnant women and survivors of trafficking and torture. In theory, this was a decision taken to ensure people’s safety during the pandemic. But, B said, when he arrived at his new accommodation, a bed and breakfast in the city centre, he found a “horrible situation”. More than 100 people had suddenly been thrust into communal living, sharing washing facilities and queueing for meals. Before, most had been receiving the standard asylum support payment of £37.50 a week, but because food was being provided, this was halted by the Home Office. “We didn’t have freedom,” B said. “We had no money, we couldn’t choose when to eat or what to eat, and nobody could tell us how long we would be there.” B was also concerned that social distancing was more difficult than in his previous home. Throughout April, the hotel population grew to more than 500 as asylum seekers continued to be sent to Glasgow. J, a young Iranian who arrived in the city that month, told the Observer – also on condition of anonymity – that while at first he found it a relief to be somewhere safe after a “painful” journey to the UK, the accommodation soon came to feel like a “stylish prison”. Both interviewees said that food sometimes arrived undercooked, and that this led to protests by residents. “We had so many people ask us, ‘when will this change?’” said Selina Hales, director of Refuweegee, one of several local charities that provided additional food parcels to hotel residents. “People were in a totally controlled environment and one of the main frustrations was the isolation.” A spokesperson for Mears told the Observer that meals were in line with NHS nutrition guidelines, and rated “good” in a survey of residents. They added that there were no recorded cases of Covid-19 in hotels during lockdown. According to the two asylum seekers, however, the fear and uncertainty prompted by this new situation began to take its toll on people’s mental health; B said that some of his friends were reminded of their experiences of being detained, either in the countries they had fled or on their journeys to the UK. “You could see people starting to unravel,” said Jack Macleod, 21, who worked for several months serving food to residents of the six hotels. Housing and welfare managers, employed by Mears, were available on site, but according to Macleod, many asylum seekers he spoke to felt abandoned. “People would come and talk to me,” said Macleod, “they would say ‘this place is making me really depressed’. The only thing I could say, because I’m not a counsellor, is ‘just try and hold on’.” Eventually, Macleod said, he left the job – a minimum-wage role he applied for via an agency when he lost his previous job at the start of the pandemic – because he felt he was being forced into the role of ad hoc social worker. Many asylum seekers suffer abuse before they reach the UK, and the Observer spoke to several people who work with refugees in Glasgow who described how the hotel conditions exacerbated some people’s existing psychological trauma. “We got used to hearing people express suicidal thoughts,” said Dylan Fotoohi, a Glasgow-based activist who helped organise food distribution during lockdown, and has since co-founded the campaign group Refugees for Justice. The spokesperson for Mears said all residents had access to mental health support through a dedicated NHS team. During lockdown, however, this team was stretched as members were seconded to hospital coronavirus wards. On 5 May, Adnan Olbeh, a 30-year-old Syrian, was found dead in his room at McLays guest house, one of the six hotels. According to friends, Olbeh had been detained and tortured in Libya, on his journey to Europe, and was complaining of flashbacks. In response, the Scottish Refugee Council – the country’s leading refugee charity – sent a letter to the UK home secretary asking for urgent action to “lessen the risk of further tragedies” in the hotels. There was no reply. The Observer has seen a copy of this letter, dated 14 May, but a spokesperson for the Home Office said they did not receive it. It was not until the stabbings in June – six weeks after Olbeh’s death – that some people began to be moved out of the hotels: the Park Inn was evacuated soon after the incident, and many of the residents were later rehoused in apartments. But why did the Home Office and its contractor find it necessary to put so many there in the first place? In public statements, Mears has said that it was partly for health and safety reasons: housing people together reduced the number of trips across Glasgow that staff had to make during lockdown, and made it easier for health workers to visit asylum seekers. Another possible reason is that it was running out of places to house people. Since 2012, asylum accommodation has been outsourced to a set of private contractors, but the system has been beset with problems: a report by the National Audit Office in July found that “providers had struggled to establish their supply chains, resulting in poor performance, delays and additional costs”. One particular pressure point is in the provision of what’s known as “initial accommodation” – the temporary housing that people who have no means to support themselves are placed in when they arrive in the UK. Mears, one of the UK’s largest private social housing providers, took over the contract that covers Glasgow in September last year, from the outsourcing giant Serco. Within weeks, it was facing a shortage of accommodation. In response, the company began renting serviced apartments – short-term lets, normally used by tourists and visitors to the city – on the open market. On 22 April, a spokesperson for Mears Group told the Scottish news website the Ferret that it had been using these short-term lets, and that it had been forced to move people into hotels because of “restrictions on the property market” brought by the pandemic. The spokesperson stressed that this decision was taken to ensure the “safety and wellbeing” of the asylum seekers, but was such a move really in people’s best interests? A condition of the Home Office housing contract is that providers must be “proactive” in identifying the needs of vulnerable people in their care – yet Mears’s account of whether it carried out adequate checks before moving people into hotels has been inconsistent. During the summer, parliament’s home affairs committee held hearings on the UK government’s response to the pandemic. In written evidence supplied to the committee on 10 June, Mears Group stated that it “risk assessed which service users it was appropriate to move, taking into account health advice”. At a press conference on 25 June, however, the company’s chief operating officer John Taylor described the move as a “blanket decision”. Once people were in hotels, he said, “it became obvious that there were vulnerabilities and that the hotel setting isn’t appropriate for some people”. The company then backtracked a few hours later, saying it held “discussions” with asylum seekers prior to deciding whether to move them. The Home Office also says that Mears held a meeting with each person before deciding whether or not to move them. In its report, published on 28 July, the home affairs committee advised that asylum seekers “should not have been moved to new accommodation during the pandemic without justified and urgent reasons for doing so, or without a vulnerability assessment demonstrating that the move could be made safely”. A spokesperson for the Home Office told the Observer that the department was conducting an evaluation of asylum accommodation and support services in Glasgow during the pandemic. On 24 August, however, Glasgow’s seven MPs walked out of a meeting with the Home Office, in protest at what they said was a refusal to commit to publish the evaluation, or share its results with them. In an open letter, the MPs stressed their dismay and anger at the “mistreatment” of people who were “unceremoniously shunted, at very short notice, from safe, secure serviced accommodation into hotel rooms, for an indefinite period, with no money and no control”. Within hours of the stabbings at the Park Inn, the incident attracted the attention of rightwing activists. “Horrible tragedy in a Glasgow hotel housing illegal immigrants,” tweeted the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage. “All over the UK, hotels are filling up with young men who are coming across the Channel every day. It is a massive risk to our wellbeing.” Farage’s comments were immediately condemned by a range of politicians, including Scotland’s justice minister. But throughout the pandemic, Farage has used his platform to encourage a sense of crisis around asylum, describing the recent rise in boat journeys across the Channel as an “invasion” and publishing short films on social media in which he claims to “investigate” the use of hotels across the country to house migrants. Members of the fascist group Britain First have also tried to exploit the issue, forcing their way into several hotels in England, confronting and intimidating residents on camera. All this, combined with the government’s own tough talk on migration, gives the impression that the UK is experiencing an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers. Yet although there was a slight increase in asylum claims last year, they fell sharply in the first six months of 2020. While more than 2,000 people crossed the Channel in boats during this period – a phenomenon that has dominated the headlines – arrivals by other routes dropped from 8,455 to 4,850, according to the head of UK Visas and Immigration. Rather, the increased use of hotels is due to a combination of the pandemic and a housing system that was already struggling to cope. While many hotels were hired by local authorities and government housing contractors during lockdown – both for asylum seekers who had nowhere else to live, and rough sleepers, some of whom may also come from migrant backgrounds – their use as temporary asylum accommodation was already on the rise. According to a recent briefing by the House of Commons library, shortly before lockdown, about 1,200 asylum seekers were being housed in “contingency accommodation” such as hotels or short-term lets, because of shortages. At the same time, delays in processing asylum claims – which mean people spend more time in state-provided housing, putting further pressure on space – have soared: about 40,000 people currently wait more than six months for a decision on their claim, an increase of 75% compared with a year ago. In an attempt to deal with the backlog, the Home Office is now considering outsourcing the asylum interview process to private contractors. Today, about 9,500 asylum-seekers are being housed in 91 hotels across the UK. The government has also modified several disused military barracks to accommodate new arrivals, in conditions exposed in the Observer last week as “squalid”. A Home Office spokesperson said that the use of former military sites “will ease our reliance on hotels and save the taxpayer money”. Sabir Zazai, chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, is worried that the use of mass accommodation will become the norm. “We are deeply concerned about this shift in asylum housing policy,” he said. “People have come here for protection, and need to be supported to rebuild their lives, not pushed to the margins.” Alison Phipps, a professor at the University of Glasgow and an expert in refugee integration, shares Zazai’s concerns. “People are arriving from situations where they’ve lived in fear,” she said, “and the question should be, how do you put people as quickly as possible in a situation where they can live in safety and be able to integrate? You can’t do that when you put people in managed facilities that are separate from the population. It’s not far from a prison regime.” In Glasgow, several hundred people are still being housed in three city hotels, which Mears has said will continue until at least the beginning of next year. Some residents have now been there for more than five months. “Hotels are never a long-term solution,” the company acknowledged, explaining that it is still having difficulty finding alternative accommodation in the city. The hardship asylum seekers face was emphasised once again in August, when Mercy Baguma, 34, from Uganda, was found dead at home next to her child. The circumstances of her death are still unclear – Baguma was reportedly seeking asylum, although she was not being housed in one of the hotels – but on 20 September, Glasgow’s MPs called for a public inquiry into all three deaths. “We take the wellbeing of everyone in the asylum system extremely seriously,” said the Home Office spokesperson. “These deaths are deeply tragic and our thoughts are with the families of these individuals.” Currently, Scotland’s police complaints body is conducting an investigation into the use of firearms at the Park Inn. But this will not examine what caused Badreddin Abadlla Adam to attack people, or whether his actions could have been prevented. At the Park Inn, he was quiet and withdrawn until the night before the stabbings, when he threatened his neighbour for playing music too loudly. “He never came to anybody’s attention,” one witness told the Daily Record, explaining that Adam had become so frustrated at his situation that he’d asked to be allowed to return to Sudan. Residents of the Park Inn, several of whom were left traumatised by the attack, were offered counselling by Mears after being moved; a group of them handed a thank-you card to police officers a few days later. An inquiry, said Phipps, would be “about justice”. “The people of Glasgow, just like the people who were seriously injured in the attacks, and the hotel staff whose lives have changed radically over the last few months, deserve to know why it was that people were hothoused in this way, and why people are still living in accommodation that they have repeatedly said is bad for them.”"
2020-11-15T08:00:29Z,Migrant children’s welfare is being sidelined in UK’s ‘brutal push to deport’,"Home Office officials have expressed concern that the welfare of children and families who have crossed the Channel to the UK is being “compromised” by an intent to prosecute individuals for immigration offences, internal emails and documents reveal. At least one senior safeguarding official has resigned over what they described as an example of the hostile environment still being used to target vulnerable new arrivals. One email from a safeguarding expert, whose brief was to inform the Home Office on the welfare needs of families due to be forcibly deported, questioned the use of restraint and “physical intervention” on children. Correspondence sent to the home secretary, Priti Patel, also reveals how an official stepped down because they did not want to “compromise the safety and wellbeing of children and families to facilitate the proliferation of an enforcement agenda”. The former safeguarding expert told the Observer that a change in the Home Office’s approach to families and children they were preparing to deport was reflected in the language of some officials. Requesting anonymity, they said: “The Home Office began undermining our welfare advice, and we started seeing quite crude assumptions made about the credibility of individuals such as asylum seekers trying to scrounge off the state or being called illegals. “I had to bite my lip. It was basic, crude and quite brutal. Children were being put to one side to focus on immigration issues.” Another email seen by the Observer also questioned if some families who crossed the Channel in small boats were being “immediately turned around and sent back to France under an obscure article”. Earlier this year, reports alleged the Home Office had launched an initiative to return migrants swiftly to France before their asylum claims were properly considered. Details of cases of concern are outlined in other emails including a family where the children were seemingly separated from parents who were subsequently restrained on the way to a deportation flight. Another highlighted case involves an Iranian teenager who was caring for her young brother and whom the Home Office twice attempted to deport before an intervention by safeguarding officials ensured they were eventually allowed to remain in the UK. Dan Sohege, director of human rights advocacy group Stand for All and a refugee law specialist, said: “It’s a very disturbing direction of travel the Home Office is going in. They are looking at exclusionary measures rather than supporting those, particularly children, who absolutely need support.” The disclosures follow attacks by Priti Patel on lawyers who she claims frustrate attempts to deport failed asylum seekers. Safeguarding officials, according to the emails, were also concerned that similar arguments have been raised in relation to deporting families with references to “high numbers of cases where further submissions and judicial reviews present barriers to removal”. However, the officials say they are legitimate legal challenges made under asylum law, and that one reference to “high numbers” was actually only 17 judicial review applications in a year. Other concerns relate to claims of information on sensitive cases being withheld from a body called the Independent Family Returns Panel (IFRP), which provides advice on the welfare plans for the forced deportation of families with children. Among the information allegedly held back from the IFRP were details on potential trafficking victims, while one message claims that the Home Office blocked a trip to Italy for the panel to evaluate the condition of reception facilities before leaving the EU. “We remain concerned about the reported situation for returnees [in Italy],” said one email. Other areas of disquiet include the holding of child refugees who have crossed the Channel in the “inappropriate accommodation” of a Kent holding facility with some detained for more than 18 hours when they arrive. Last month, it emerged one 15-year-old boy was held for over 66 hours. The Home Office has been contacted for comment."
2020-11-24T15:45:43Z,Anger grows over use of 'brutal force' by French police dismantling refugee camp,"The French government is facing growing anger over the “shocking” use of excessive force by police dismantling a protest refugee camp in central Paris. Officers were filmed tipping migrants out of tents, slamming riot shields into individuals, chasing people down streets and attacking refugees, journalists and others with truncheons and teargas. The criticism comes as the government is already under fire for a new law that would give police greater powers and is viewed as a threat to the freedom of the press. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, also expressed outrage at what she called police violence and said the breaking up of the camp was a “denial of France’s humanitarian duty”. “Present at the time, elected representatives of Paris city and of parliament reported, once again, the use of disproportionate and brutal force, confirmed by the many photographs that were taken. Unfortunately, this unacceptable episode is not without precedent,” Hidalgo wrote in a letter to the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin. Darmanin, who described the photos and videos of the police operation as shocking, said he had received a report from police chiefs and would ask the IGPN – the force’s internal disciplinary body – to look into “several unacceptable” incidents. Darmanin said he expected the inquiry to report back within 48 hours and promised to make the conclusions public. The Paris public prosecutor announced it had opened an official investigation for “violence by a person in public authority” following a complaint by journalist Rémy Buisine that he was assaulted several times by one officer as he covered the protest on Monday evening. It followed the prosecutor opening a similar investigation after seeing a video of a police officer deliberately tripping up a migrant as he ran from the police. Police and gendarmes were sent in late on Monday to clear a camp from the square in central Paris. About 450 refugees had set up tents at the request of the charity Utopia 56 to protest against the forcible clearing of migrants from makeshift shelters in the northern suburb of Saint-Denis. While some of those evacuated were provided with temporary accommodation, scores of migrants were left wandering the streets. Before the protest camp was set up at Place de la République, Utopia 56 had issued a statement demanding the authorities provide shelter for the estimated 3,000 homeless migrants sleeping rough in and around the French capital. As night fell, police and gendarmes arrived to clear the square. Officers were filmed pulling up tents and throwing people to the ground. Lawyers, MPs and city councillors in Place de la République tried to calm tensions and stop the police action, without success. Police used teargas and crowd dispersal grenades to break up groups of people, and journalists said they were deliberately targeted. The police operation came at a delicate time for the French government, which is facing widespread criticism for a new law that would make it illegal to disseminate images of police officers in certain circumstances. Darmanin has vigorously defended Article 24 of the law, which would require media to obscure the faces of police officers, as “protecting those who protect us”. The law, seen by many as a direct threat to press freedom, also authorises police use of drones and facial recognition technology. It has passed its first reading in the Assemblée Nationale. The United Nations human rights council has raised concerns about the law, while France’s own independent defender of rights, Claire Hédon, has expressed her reservations, saying she is especially concerned about the “envisaged restrictions concerning the publishing of images of police agents while on duty” and guarantees that these would not threaten “either the freedom of the press or the right to information”. A statement from the police prefecture said the organisation of ad-hoc migrant camps in the city was “not acceptable” and that its officers had “therefore set about the immediate dispersion of this illegal occupation of a public space”. Ian Brossat, a deputy Paris mayor in charge of housing, who was present, condemned the police operation and said the only solution was for the state to find housing for the homeless. “This problem is not one for the police to sort out. To think that we resolve social problems with truncheons is totally crazy,” Brossat said. “As long as there is no available housing, there will be people living outside, and as long as there are people living outside, there will be camps. To think we can solve that with the police harassment we have seen this evening is pathetic.” Éric Coquerel, an MP for the leftwing La France Insoumise party, who was present at Place de la République on Monday, told FranceInfo: “What we saw was repression that is sadly not that unusual but was completely disproportionate. Was there a risk to the police officers? No. Was there a risk of damage to property? No. Instead there was a repression that fell, I remind you, on people who are only demanding that their human rights are respected, on peaceful activists, on journalists and elected representatives without discrimination.” After the death of the French delivery driver Cédric Chouviat, who said “I’m suffocating” several times as police held him to the ground – an echo of George Floyd’s death in the US – Darmanin caused an outcry in July when he told the Assemblée Nationale: “When I hear the words ‘police violence’ personally, it’s me who suffocates.” He added: “The police certainly exercise a violence, but it’s legitimate violence … after that, it has to be done in a proportional manner, within a framework. That a few people do so outside of the professional rules, punishment should be immediate. But it’s normal that the police and gendarmes are armed, intervene with force, so that the force remains with the republic and is not subject to the law of gangs or communities.” Asked about police violence last year in the wake of the gilets jaunes protests, against which law and order forces used teargas, pepper spray, water cannon and rubber bullets, the president, Emmanuel Macron, responded: “Don’t talk of ‘repression’ or ‘police violence’; these words are unacceptable in a legal state.”"
2020-08-30T06:02:29Z,How Angela Merkel’s great migrant gamble paid off,"Mohammad Hallak found the key to unlock the mysteries of his new homeland when he realised you could switch the subtitles on your Netflix account to German. The 21-year-old Syrian from Aleppo jotted down words he didn’t know, increased his vocabulary and quickly became fluent. Last year, he passed his end of high school exams with a grade of 1.5, the top mark in his year group. Five years to the month after arriving in Germany as an unaccompanied minor, Hallak is now in his third term studying computer science at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences and harbours an aspiration to become an IT entrepreneur. “Germany was always my goal”, he says, in the mumbled sing-song of the Ruhr valley dialect. “I’ve always had a funny feeling that I belong here.” Hallak, an exceptionally motivated student with high social aptitude, is not representative of all the 1.7 million people who applied for asylum in Germany between 2015 and 2019, making it the country with the fifth highest population of refugees in the world. Some of those with whom he trekked through Turkey and across the Mediterranean, he says, haven’t picked up more than a few words and “just chill”. But Hallak is not a complete outlier either. More than 10,000 people who arrived in Germany as refugees since 2015 have mastered the language sufficiently to enrol at a German university. More than half of those who came are in work and pay taxes. Among refugee children and teenagers, more than 80% say they have a strong sense of belonging to their German schools and feel liked by their peers. Success stories like Hallak’s partially redeem the optimism expressed by Angela Merkel in a sentence she spoke five years ago this week, at the peak of one of the most tumultuous years in recent European history – a sentence that nearly cost her her job and that she herself has partially retreated from. “I put it simply, Germany is a strong country,” the German chancellor told the media at a press conference in central Berlin on 31 August 2015, trying to address concerns about the steeply rising number of people – mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan – applying for asylum in Germany that summer. “The motive with which we approach these matters must be: we have already managed so much, we’ll manage this.” During the German TV broadcast of her interview, headlines flashed up to report that Hungary was sending trainloads of people to the German border, 20,000 of whom turned up at Munich central station the following week alone. The German phrase Merkel used, Wir schaffen das, became so memorable mainly because it would in the weeks and months that followed be endlessly quoted back at her by those who believed that the German chancellor’s optimistic message had encouraged millions more migrants to embark on a dangerous odyssey across the Med. “Merkel’s actions, now, will be hard to correct: her words cannot be unsaid,” wrote the Spectator. “She has exacerbated a problem that will be with us for years, perhaps decades.” The Alternative für Deutschland party, founded two years previously on a more narrowly anti-euro ticket, discovered a new populist stride: when Merkel said “We will manage”, the rightwing party claimed, she really meant “You will manage”, asking the German public to cope with rising levels of crime, terrorism and public disorder. “We don’t want to manage this!” the AfD politician Alexander Gauland proclaimed at a party rally in October 2015. Over the coming months and years – in the wake of the New Year’s Eve sexual assaults in Cologne, the Bataclan terror attack in Paris and the truck rampage on Berlin’s Breitscheidtplatz Christmas market – that sentiment seemed to gain traction with a growing part of the German population, even when the crimes were not carried out by people who had arrived in 2015. By 2017, there was a prevalent view that Wir schaffen das would be Merkel’s undoing, a “catastrophic mistake” as Donald Trump said in January that year. “The worst decision a European leader has made in modern times,” Nigel Farage told Fox News. “She’s finished.” Yet today Merkel still sits at the top of Europe’s largest economy, her personal approval ratings back to where they were at the start of 2015 and the polling of her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), buoyed to record levels by the global pandemic. When Merkel steps down ahead of federal elections in 2021, as is expected, her party’s successor currently looks more likely to be a centrist in her mould than a hardliner promising a symbolic break with her stance on immigration. The AfD, meanwhile, never reached the point “when it will be the country’s second-largest party”, as historian Niall Ferguson predicted in February 2018. The party has established a steady presence in local parliaments across Germany, especially in the states of the formerly socialist east. But at federal level the AfD has dropped to fourth in the polls, down from its third place and 12.6% at elections in 2017, and has been stricken with infighting since immigration has dropped off the top of the political agenda. The spectre of jihadist terrorism, which some feared the refugee crisis would usher into the heart of central Europe, has faded from view in recent years. After a spate of seven attacks with an Islamist motive in Germany in 2016, culminating with a truck driven into a Berlin Christmas market that December, the country has seen no further attacks for the last three years. Peter Neumann, a terrorism expert at King’s College London’s Department of War Studies, recalls being invited onto a German TV programme at the height of the crisis in 2015. “I gave my optimistic best back then, but deep down I was worried,” he says. “Will this work out? With nearly a million people about whom we know so little? In the end, those fears were misplaced. “We know that some of the men involved in the Bataclan attack had exploited the chaos to smuggle themselves into Europe, in some cases posing as Syrian refugees. We also knew that the vast majority of people who arrived were young men, the very demographic that is most susceptible to radicalisation. And yet, we can now say that the worst fears haven’t come true. “In hindsight, Isis’s collapse happened quicker than we expected. It’s now clear that what made them so attractive for a while is less their ideology than their success. And when Isis stopped being successful, it stopped being attractive.” However, Neumann says this was also due to the increasing efficiency of German intelligence agencies. According to data collected by Petter Nesser, a senior research fellow with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, 16 terror plots with a jihadist motive have been foiled on German soil since the start of 2015, more than in France or the UK over the same period. The events of the summer of 2015 did evidently mobilise and further radicalise Germany’s rightwing extremist circles, who targeted asylum shelters with arson attacks or assassinated politicians with pro-immigration views, such as the CDU’s Walter Lübcke. No other country in Europe saw as much severe and fatal rightwing violence in 2019 as Germany. Germany’s Federal Office of Criminal Investigations records a rise of criminal offences, including violent crime, in the years between 2014 and 2016, linking the trend to the influx of migration. The percentage of asylum seekers found guilty of such crimes also doubled in the same period. However, the majority of these offences were within the refugee shelters where new arrivals were initially housed. By 2017, when Trump claimed that “crime in Germany is way up” because it had taken in “all of those illegals”, the number of overall recorded crimes was decreasing. Last year, crime in Germany sank to an 18-year low. What about the organised crime on Europe’s borders, where human traffickers prey on those willing to risk it all in the hope of a better life? In a 2017 book on reforming asylum policy, British economist Paul Collier argued that “while the industry was already well-established in the Mediterranean, the massive rise in demand triggered by the invitation from Germany further increased demand for smuggling by criminal syndicates.” Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative, a thinktank that advises EU member-states on migration policy, disagrees vehemently: “The thesis that Merkel created the refugee crisis was absurd in 2015, and it’s even more absurd in retrospect,” he says. Empirical studies have failed to find data proving that Merkel’s Wir schaffen das significantly intensified the movement of refugees into Europe, although it is likely that the attention drawn towards Germany’s liberal stance on asylum influenced the decisions of those who were already in Europe at the time. “The question is: what could she have done differently?” says Knaus. “Reintroduce borders and try what France did after the Bataclan attacks in November 2015, sending all irregular migrants back to Italy? That proved futile: France received twice as many asylum applications in 2019 as in 2015. You can’t seal a wide-open border with rhetoric and a few more border guards, while brutality was fortunately ruled out in Germany.” Germany’s stance in 2015 did prove too optimistic in the sense that Merkel’s government seemed to believe that the tumultuous events of that summer would lead to a quick reform of the Dublin Regulation, the mechanism that determines which state is responsible for examining an asylum application. Knaus says: “The Germans thought everyone would sign up to a quota system because it was ‘fair’, but they couldn’t explain how this would work in practice.” Instead, Merkel’s government took unilateral steps to slow down the rate of new arrivals to a trickle. An agreement between Turkey and the EU to stop irregular migration and replace it with a resettlement scheme, developed by Knaus’s thinktank, drastically stemmed the flow of migrants to Europe in 2016. Merkel’s government later tried to limit asylum applications from north Africa by adding Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to its list of countries considered safe, though the proposal was later rejected by the upper chamber of Germany’s parliament. In March this year, Germany launched a social media campaign to deter Syrian refugees from embarking on a journey to central Europe, and Merkel’s “grand coalition” with the centre-left Social Democratic party voted against taking in even just 5,000 vulnerable refugees stranded in Greek camps. Merkel never recanted her words of August 2015, as many even in her own party insisted she should. But she did ensure a situation like the one that followed won’t be repeated on German soil during her tenure. On a sweltering afternoon in Berlin’s suburban south, preparations are afoot for the annual summer fete at the Marienfelde transit centre, a sprawling concrete camp that used to be the first port of call for many East Germans who fled to the west during the cold war, and now houses asylum seekers from around the world. While volunteers erect socially distanced benches and hang up garlands in the courtyard, a group of men and women from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq have gathered inside to meet the Berlin senate’s integration officer, to ask for advice and air grievances. A 44-year-old Syrian is concerned that he might fail next month’s language exam, even though he will need a pass in order to start working. German classes have been cancelled because of the pandemic, and the wireless signal inside the camp is too weak for online learning. “Berlin, on our doorstep, that is Europe,” says the man, who doesn’t want to give his name for fear of getting into trouble with the Syrian embassy. “But this shelter is like a little Syria: everyone speaks Arabic.” Germany was not the destination of choice for the father of three, who arrived in the country via the resettlement programme of the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UNHCR, in 2018. He is grateful that Merkel’s government took him in, but the wait for a work permit is starting to exasperate him. Before Berlin, he worked for six years as a pastry chef in Izmit, Turkey, but German bakers won’t accept his qualifications – he would need to do another two-year apprenticeship first. “It’s very frustrating.” The integration officer assures him she empathises with his plight: Katarina Niewiedzial, who has been in the post since 2019, was once a migrant herself, having arrived in Germany from Poland as a 12-year-old. She knows from personal experience the areas of public life where Germany is ill-equipped for the task of integrating newcomers. German employers are often still reluctant to recognise foreign qualifications. If migrants lack the certificates to prove they are qualified enough to do a job, they can apply to prove their skills in an interview, but they need fluent German to do so – a bigger challenge for adults in their 40s than teenagers like Hallak. Last year, the German Chamber of Commerce only carried out 80 such “qualification analysis” processes in the whole of Germany. Often refugees end up in jobs they are overqualified for, such as catering, which in turn are more precarious and have cut staff during the pandemic: in May this year, the number of unemployed Berliners without a German passport was up by 40% compared to the same period in 2019. Many experts think that the integration classes that have been mandatory for refugees in Germany since 2005 are no longer fit for purpose, holding back those with academic qualifications while failing to offer real help for those who arrive without being able to read or write. The percentage of those failing the all-important B1 language test has risen rather than fallen over the last five years. And yet, Niewiedzial is optimistic. “Germany can be a very sluggish country, full of tiresome bureaucracy,” she says. “But it’s also able to learn from its mistakes and draw consequences from them.” Since 2015, she says, the state had massively expanded its asylum authority, created thousands of posts to coordinate volunteers, turned shelters into permanent homes and trained specialist teachers. Germany has managed. “It’s a success story, even if no one quite has the confidence to say that yet.” Key dates 27 August 2015 71 migrants are found dead inside a refrigerated lorry abandoned in Austria. The discovery sparks international revulsion, and contributes to the decisions of several countries to open their borders to people fleeing war and poverty. 31 August 2015 Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, says Wir schaffen das – We’ll manage this – after visiting a camp for newly arrived refugees. Soon after she announces an open-door policy; in the year that follows over a million people claim asylum in Germany. 13 November 2015 The Bataclan attack in Paris is the first of a series of deadly attacks by Isis-affiliated extremists across Europe. In July 2016 a Syrian who declared his support for the group kills himself and injures 15 others with a homemade bomb at a music festival in the German town of Ansbach. The far right uses the attacks to argue against Merkel’s refugee policies. March 2016 The EU strikes a deal with Turkey to return all refugees and migrants who reach Europe across the Aegean sea. This dramatically reduces the number of people arriving in Germany and other European countries to claim asylum. 19 September 2016 Merkel’s CDU party suffers a slump in support to just 18% in Berlin state elections, while anti-immigration populists Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) enters the German capital’s state parliament for the first time. Mayor Michael Müller warns that the level of support it won “would be seen around the world as a sign of the return of the rightwing and the Nazis in Germany”. 19 December 2016 A Tunisian whose asylum application had been turned down rams a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and wounding 70. Isis claims it inspired the attack. 24 September 2017 The populist radical-right AfD party enters the Bundestag, the German parliament, as the third biggest party. After Merkel forms a coalition with the Social Democrats, it becomes the largest opposition party. October 2018 After crushing defeats in local elections, Merkel says she will step down as CDU leader almost immediately, and will not contest the 2021 elections, making her fourth term as Germany’s chancellor her last. 2020 Merkel’s effective handling of the coronavirus crisis helps restore her popularity, particularly as the US and UK stumble. One poll finds over 80% of Germans think she is doing her job “rather well”. Emma Graham-Harrison • This article was amended on 31 August 2020. An earlier version said that Germany had the second highest population of refugees in the world; this was corrected to fifth highest population. It also said the German government had added Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to its list of countries considered safe; in fact this proposal was later rejected by the Bundesrat."
2020-11-09T17:37:54Z,EU draft declaration sets out stricter rules on migrant integration,"Migrants to Europe must learn the language of their new home countries and encourage their children to integrate in the light of the recent Islamist terror attacks, EU governments plan to say in a declaration drafted by France, Austria and Germany. The contentious draft statement, due to be made by EU home affairs ministers on Friday, is being championed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was accused by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of religious persecution after his recent warning of the dangers of Islamist separatism. It will also say Brussels should fund religious education within Muslim communities, and NGOs publishing “content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving” state support under the terms of the resolution. There is some unease among fellow EU governments about the framing of the current draft, however. Sweden, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, among others, have traditionally pushed back against those who have viewed migration and religion through the prism of security. “Singling out a religion or group is never the answer to violent extremism by individuals,” said one senior EU diplomat. “We should do well to remember that embracing fundamental values isn’t just a responsibility of migrants or the Muslim community but for all us. We should be careful not to bring down our accomplishments by other people’s sins.” Should the statement be pulled before Friday, EU diplomats believe Macron will seek to push it again at a meeting of the bloc’s 27 heads of state and government in two weeks time. In a letter to the Financial Times in which Macron complained about an article criticising his approach – now withdrawn from the newspaper’s website – the president wrote that he would “not allow anybody to claim that France, or its government, is fostering racism against Muslims”. The current draft ministerial declaration says that the recent terrorist atrocities in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Nice and Vienna have revealed the “extent of the threat we face from Islamist terrorism”. Alongside a series of technical counter-terrorism proposals, including the creation of backdoor access to encrypted communications used in chat apps, the statement proposes a tougher line on the need for migrants to integrate. “Successful integration of immigrants with a sense of belonging and equality is of central importance for the social cohesion of our modern pluralist, and open societies,” the draft says. “Integration is a two-way street: providing support but expecting more in return (fordern und fördern) is a core principle in this. This means that migrants are expected to make an active effort to become integrated while they are offered help with integration through government integration measures. “Along with recognition of European values, what successful integration means above all is learning the language of one’s new country, earning a living for oneself and for one’s family, and supporting the integration of one’s children … “It needs to be possible to sanction sustained refusal to integrate more strongly than has been the case to date. Organisations that support content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving public funding.” The declaration further suggests that the European commission should fund religious education and training among imams. “We want to strengthen European Muslims as our partners in the fight against Islamist extremism for they too are its victims,” it says. “We want to support them in their efforts to organise their religion independently of foreign interference. In our view it is necessary to develop a shared language at European level which distinguishes between Islam and Islamism in the sense of religiously motivate extremism.” Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium who is now president of the European Council, tweeted: “To fight the Ideology of Hatred, we need to setup as soon as possible a European Institute to train imams in Europe. “Online messages glorifying terrorism must be quickly removed. There must be no impunity for terrorists and those praising them on internet.”"
2020-10-18T22:30:01Z,Australia's refugee intake falls 30% below target as pandemic takes toll,"The home affairs department has reported a significant reduction in the number of visas being granted – including refugee visas, which have been reduced by almost a third – in large part due to the pandemic. Despite the drop in visa numbers, the department still raised $2.2bn in revenue through applications. Of the 13,171 humanitarian places the department reported as delivered, 11,521 were given to refugees outside of Australia who had been assessed as needing protection. The government has set a target of 18,750 places, meaning home affairs failed to meet its metric, delivering almost 30% less places than the year before. Three-quarters of the humanitarian offshore visas were delivered to those in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Middle East, while “vulnerable” people (women, children, LGBTIQ people) made up 21%. Just under 45% of those granted humanitarian visas have been settled in regions outside of Sydney, Melbourne and greater Brisbane, as part of the government’s plan to settle refugees and migrants away from Australia’s major centres. “The humanitarian program was not fully delivered in 2019–20 due to the temporary suspension of granting of all offshore humanitarian visas in March 2020 as a result of Covid-19 travel restrictions,” the department said in its latest annual report. “This followed the announcement by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and the International Organization for Migration of a suspension of resettlement travel on 16 March 2020 due to Covid-19.” It wasn’t just humanitarian visas which were down. Overall, the department recorded an almost 25% decrease in visa lodgements after Australia closed its international borders. Visa cancellations due to the public health orders were not included as part of the home affairs remit. “The administration of Australia’s migration program was significantly impacted by Covid-19 and associated travel restrictions,” the department reported. “The department delivered 140,366 permanent placements, down from 160,323 in 2018–19. Although the number of temporary and permanent visa applications reduced by 2.3 million in comparison to 2018–19, the department continued to contribute to Australia’s economic prosperity through granting 6.5 million temporary visas, compared to 8.8 million granted in 2018–19. “The department maintained its focus on the integrity of the migration program with 325,637 temporary and permanent (non-humanitarian) visas refused, a decrease of 13.7% on 2018–19.” How visas are granted in Australia has come under renewed scrutiny after former New South Wales MP Daryl Maguire was linked to a “cash for visa” scheme which has formed part of the investigations by Icac, the NSW corruption watchdog. Home affairs is one of the first departments to be questioned in budget estimates this week. The visa scheme will be one of the issues canvassed by non-government senators during the hearing on Monday, with clarification wanted over the state and federal ties. Australians stranded overseas will also form part of the hearing. Close to 30,000 have registered to come home. Last week the federal government announced another 5,000 or so Australians could be catered for between now and March with the inclusion of the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs centre in the quarantine program, but critics point out that won’t do much to increase the numbers of Australians being brought home or stem the flow of those being added to the list. Meanwhile, home affairs also reported almost 2,200 calls were made to its national security hotline in relation to foreign interference concerns. Departmental officials pointed to an increased awareness due to the government’s new focus on the issue, with universities one of the key stakeholders asking for clarification. “Call rates are likely to increase further throughout 2020–21 as awareness of the program continues to expand,” a spokesperson said."
2020-12-17T18:37:41Z,Thousands of refugees in mental health crisis after years on Greek islands,"Years of entrapment on Aegean islands has resulted in a mental health crisis for thousands of refugees, with one in three contemplating suicide, a report compiled by psychosocial support experts has revealed. Containment policies pursued by the EU have also spurred ever more people to attempt to end their lives, according to the report released by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) on Thursday. “Research reveals consistent accounts of severe mental health conditions,” says the report, citing data collated over the past two and a half years on Lesbos, Samos and Chios. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-harm “among people of all ages and backgrounds” have emerged as byproducts of the hopelessness and despair on Europe’s eastern borderlands, it says. “As many as three out of four of the people the IRC has assisted through its mental health programme on the three islands reported experiencing symptoms such as sleeping problems, depression and anxiety,” its authors wrote. “One in three reported suicidal thoughts, while one in five reported having made attempts to take their lives.” In a year upended by coronavirus and disastrous fires on Lesbos – about 13,000 asylum seekers were temporarily displaced after the destruction of Moria, the island’s infamous holding centre – psychologists concluded that the humanitarian situation on the outposts had worsened considerably. The mental health toll had been aggravated by lockdown measures that had kept men, women and children confined to facilities for much of 2020, they said. Previously, residents in Moria, Europe’s biggest refugee camp before its destruction, had participated in football games outside the facility and other group activities. Noting that the restrictions were stricter for refugees and migrants than those applied elsewhere in Greece, IRC support teams found a marked deterioration in the mental wellbeing of people in the camps since rolling lockdowns were enforced in March. “Research demonstrates how the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the suffering of already vulnerable asylum seekers and exposed the many flaws in Europe’s asylum and reception system,” the report says. Over the year there has been a rise in the proportion of people disclosing psychotic symptoms, from one in seven to one in four. Disclosures of self-harm have increased by 66%. The IRC, founded by Albert Einstein in 1933 and now led by the former British foreign secretary David Miliband, said the findings offered more evidence of the persistent political and policy failures at Greek and EU level. Five years after authorities scrambled to establish reception and identification centres, or hotspots, on the frontline isles at the start of the refugee crisis, about 15,000 men, women and children remain stranded in the installations. Describing conditions in the camps as dangerous and inhumane, the IRC said residents were still denied access to sufficient water, sanitation, shelter and vital services such as healthcare, education and legal assistance to process asylum claims. On Lesbos, the island most often targeted by traffickers working along the Turkish coast, government figures this week showed an estimated 7,319 men, women and children registered in a temporary camp erected in response to an emergency that has been blamed on arsonists. Three months after the fires, more than 5,000 people have been transferred to the mainland, according to Greek authorities. Of that number, more than 800 were relocated to the EU, including 523 children who had made the journey to Europe alone and were also held in Moria. Many had hoped the new camp would be a vast improvement on Moria, whose appalling conditions and severe overcrowding earned it global notoriety as a humanitarian disaster. But the new facility, located on a former firing range within metres of the sea, has drawn condemnation from locals and NGOs. “The winds hit it, the rains hit it and there’s no shade, which is why this place is unsuitable for any camp to be,” the island’s mayor, Stratis Kitilis, said. “It’s right next door to all the warehouses, transport companies and supermarkets that keep Lesbos going. No one wants it there.” This month the EU announced it was working with Athens’ centre-right administration to replace the installation with a modern structure that will open next September. New reception and identification centres will also be built on Samos, Kos and Lesbos. “They say it’ll be nothing like Moria and will be more of a transfer stop, but late next year is a very long time,” said Kitilis. Kiki Michailidou, the psychologist in charge of the IRC’s psychosocial support programmes on Lesbos, agreed that the conditions were far from dignified. As winter approached, camp residents were resorting to ever more desperate measures to keep warm, she said, while also being forced to stand in long queues for food and communal toilets. With camp managers moving families into giant tents, social distancing remains elusive. “A lot of people fear the unknown again,” Michailidou said. “Moria was terrible but it was also a familiar place, somewhere they called their home. After the fires they lost their point of reference and that has had a significant impact on their mental health too.” The IRC report calls for European policymakers to learn from past failings. While the EU’s new pact on asylum and migration is a step in the right direction, it says, it still falls short of the bloc managing migration in a humane and effective way. Echoing that sentiment, Michailidou said: “After the fires we saw what could happen. There were transfers to the mainland and children were relocated to other parts of Europe. That’s proof that where there’s political will and coordinated action, the lives of people in these camps can be transformed.”"
2020-11-13T14:46:37Z,"Both sides in Ethiopian conflict are killing civilians, refugees say","Refugees fleeing the conflict in northern Ethiopia have claimed both sides are committing atrocities against civilians, and described hospitals struggling to cope with casualties. Three days ago Hadgemes Gegressie, 37, fled his home in the frontier town of Humera, in the restive Tigray region where forces loyal to the local administration and the national military are engaged in fierce clashes. Amnesty International reported on Thursday that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera last week. Gegressie told the Guardian of extensive damage to buildings in Humera and killings “based on ethnicity”. “I don’t know whether my family is alive or dead. There are no communications. They cut the internet and the telephone lines … I am already suffering for my family,” he said, speaking at the customs post on the border with Ethiopia. A second refugee said he had seen “killing and looting” in Humera, and now feared for his four children. “I visited some wounded people in the hospital, taking some fruit and water for them, and I saw at least 100 people who had been shot at, among them women,” said Nugus Gady, a 55-year-old farmer. “It became very difficult to stay. You can’t sleep at night. The shooting was coming from the Eritrean side as well.” Gady described militia with the Ethiopian army who “shot people carrying weapons without any warning” after Tigrayan forces were forced to withdraw from Humera because of food and water shortages. “They were trying to defend us but they could not,” he said. With communications down and the media barred, independent verification of such incidents and the status of the conflict is difficult. There is no confirmation of the refugees’ claims. However the reports of atrocities will fuel an increasingly bitter conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa’s second most populous country. Amnesty International said it had not been able to independently confirm who was responsible for the killings in Mai Kadra last week but witnesses reported that forces loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which is in power in the province, were responsible after they were defeated by the federal EDF forces. “We have confirmed the massacre of a very large number of civilians, who appear to have been day labourers in no way involved in the ongoing military offensive. This is a horrific tragedy whose true extent only time will tell as communication in Tigray remains shut down,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s director for east and southern Africa. Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, launched military operations in Tigray after he accused local authorities of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets. The TPLF denies the attack and has accused the prime minister of concocting the story to justify the offensive. Airstrikes and ground combat between government forces and the TPLF have since killed hundreds and raised international concern over the willingness of Abiy, Africa’s youngest leader, who won a Nobel peace prize last year, to risk a lengthy civil war. The Guardian has viewed photographic evidence showing dozens of corpses laid out on rope beds and flatbed trucks. The images appear to corroborate the reports of atrocities, though do not indicate who was responsible. Amnesty quoted testimony from three people who said they had been told by survivors of the massacre that the attackers were members of the Tigray Special Police Force and the TPLF who entered the town after a clash with national forces and militia from the neighbouring Amhara province. “Amnesty International has not yet been able to confirm who was responsible … but has spoken to witnesses who said forces loyal to the TPLF were responsible for the mass killings, apparently after they suffered defeat from the federal EDF forces,” it said. Tigray’s leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, who chairs the TPLF, denied his forces were involved in the killings. “This is unbelievable … this should be investigated,” Debretsion said in a text message to Reuters, accusing Abiy of “creating facts on [the] ground”. There was no immediate response to the Amnesty report from the Ethiopian government. More than 11,000 Ethiopian refugees have crossed into Sudan since fighting started and humanitarian organisations say the situation in Tigray is deteriorating. About 7,000 of those crossing have arrived at Hamdayat, in Sudan’s Kassala state, with another 4,000 arriving at Luqdi in al-Qadarif state. Most of them are Tigrayan and about 45% are female, the UN said. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018. He won last year’s Nobel peace prize for ending a war with neighbouring Eritrea. The political reforms the 44-year-old former soldier pushed through won wide praise, but have allowed old ethnic and other grievances to surface. Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and blamed for the country’s problems. The postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic aggravated tensions and when parliamentarians in Addis Ababa, the capital, voted to extend officials’ mandates, Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy’s government deemed illegal. Both sides have access to heavy weapons, armour and considerable stocks of ammunition, and observers have warned that a lengthy conflict is possible. In a letter to the Guardian, 39 academics based in the UK who specialise in studying Ethiopia, expressed their concern at the ongoing military confrontation and called for London “to break its silence and use all diplomatic means at its disposal in support of an immediate end to the hostilities and finding a way to resolve the underlying conflict”. “Over the past two years, we have been watching [Ethiopia] oscillate between hopeful optimism and deadly conflict, and these latest developments represent a serious escalation of violence that threatens to drag Ethiopia into a civil war with devastating consequences for its people, its economy and regional stability,” the letter reads. There is little sign of any moves to end the conflict. On Friday, Ethiopia’s parliament appointed a new head of the Tigray region, a day after it stripped 39 members of the TPLF, including Gebremichael, of immunity from prosecution. Ethiopia has long been seen as a cornerstone of US strategic interests in the Horn of Africa region. On Thursday, the Republican senator for Idaho, Jim Risch, who is chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, said the risk of the conflict descending into civil war was “a real, present, and immediate danger to regional stability, US national security interests, and, most importantly, the safety and welfare of the Ethiopian people and Ethiopia’s democratic transition”. “The United States and the international community must continue to direct engagement to ensure all sides commit to an immediate ceasefire, protecting all civilians, providing prompt humanitarian access, restoring internet and phone access, and pursuing a peaceful resolution through dialogue,” Risch said."
2020-12-15T06:29:04Z,Refugees detained in Melbourne hotel 'devastated' as they await move to another site,"Refugees and asylum seekers detained at a Melbourne hotel for more than a year are said to be “devastated” and “confused” as they await their relocation to another as-yet undisclosed site. About 60 men, who are detained at the Mantra hotel in Preston in Melbourne’s north, were told by the Australian border force on Monday they would soon be moved because the contract with the hotel was expiring. They received no further details. The announcement dashed hopes that the men might be released into the community, after five asylum seekers were granted visas last week. The five, like the men at the Mantra hotel, were brought to Australia from Manus Island under the now-defunct medevac legislation. As part of the Lives in Limbo series, Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday that the vast majority of the 192 refugees and asylum seekers who were evacuated to Australia for medical treatment are still being detained. Alison Battisson, a lawyer who represents four of the men at the Mantra, said it was still unclear when the men would be moved, though she expected the relocation to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday. In the meantime, advocates have formed a picket line outside the hotel, where they are expected to stay until the men are moved. Battisson said her clients were “devastated” and “very disappointed” by the Border Force announcement on Monday, especially given some of their friends had been released last week. Noeline Harendran, of Sydney West Legal, which also represents some people detained at the Mantra, said her clients were “anxious and really confused”. “They haven’t been able to have fresh air, sunlight, since the beginning of the year,” she said. “They can’t go for walks outside, things that people have taken for granted, they haven’t been able to do.” The five people released last week, who were represented by Sydney West Legal, were granted visas days before the federal government was required to make submissions in their cases to the federal court. Harendran said she was still hopeful the men at the Mantra would also be released into the community. One refugee there, Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, said Border Force officials had provided few details on Monday. “They didn’t talk about [a] visa, they said there’s no visa or any other information,” he said. “I said, ‘Where is the location?’ And they said they didn’t know. I said, ‘Is it Christmas Island?’ And they said no.” On Monday the Department of Home Affairs said the men would be relocated to another site in Melbourne. It added that no one who had been under the regional processing regime would be settled in Australia. Azimitabar said he and his fellow detainees were thankful to dozens of protesters who had rallied outside the hotel until 4am on Tuesday. “They give us hope, always,” he said. “We are all sad, we are all depressed, upset. But when we see people protesting for us, we are hopeful. It helps us not to give up.” Omar Hassan, from the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism, said some of the detainees had been communicating with the protesters from their windows on Monday night. “We were doing call-and-response chants … they were doing the classic symbol of resistance [crossing their arms above their heads],” Hassan said. “They keep shouting, ‘Thank you, thank you.’” Dozens of protesters including refugee advocates and trade unionistswere again gathering at the site on Tuesday evening. Another of the detainees, Ismail Hussein, 29, from Somalia, told Guardian Australia on Monday the conditions were “more difficult than what we experienced in Manus Island”. “Maybe one hour of gym – that’s the only time that I am not in my room,” he said. “The rest of the day, I’m lying on my bed or sitting on the chair.” The Department of Home Affairs was contacted for further comment."
2020-08-15T13:15:43Z,"Give refugees crossing Channel a chance, say Windrush survivors","Survivors of the Windrush scandal have attacked the home secretary, saying her approach to the Channel migrant crossings is creating “the same set of conditions” that led to the government victimising the children of Commonwealth immigrants. A letter to Priti Patel from 100 prominent refugee and human rights campaigners, including members of the Windrush generation, warns that the “pattern of ignoring expert advice, failing to engage with civil society and branding migrants as criminal” replicates Home Office failings that caused the 2018 Windrush scandal. They also believe Patel’s hard-nosed strategy contravenes a central recommendation from the Windrush Lessons Learned Review that urges the Home Office to implement policies based on evidence and transparent decision-making. Among the signatories is Michael Braithwaite, who arrived from Barbados as a child in 1961 and lost his job as a special needs teaching assistant two years ago for not having an up-to-date identity document. The 68-year-old said: “The Home Office doesn’t care. They need to give people a chance. They’re making a life-threatening journey – babies, mums and kids.” More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the Channel in boats this year, which Patel said was “appalling”, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called “very bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal”. The letter, dated 14 August and whose signatories include the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Oxfam, Liberty, Refugee Action and the Runnymede Trust, also condemns Home Office officials and Patel for attempting to discredit lawyers who represent asylum seekers. Patel told Tory MPs last week that the asylum system was being “exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers” who were stopping the government removing people. The letter also points out that Patel’s attitude to asylum seekers is typified by last week’s response of a senior Home Office source to criticism from the ice-cream makers Ben and Jerry’s. After the firm urged her to show more “humanity” and reminded her that “people cannot be illegal”, the source accused it of selling “overpriced junk food”. James Cleverly, a Foreign Office minister, then tweeted: “Can I have a large scoop of statistically inaccurate virtue signalling with my grossly overpriced ice-cream, please?” Government and ministerial statements have also repeatedly labelled the crossings illegal, which the letter reminds Patel is inaccurate. Also signed by Bail for Immigration Detainees, Praxis, Safe Passage, Detention Action and Help Refugees, the letter, states: “To brand this as ‘illegal’ or ‘criminal’ activity is irresponsible and wrong, and is precisely the same rhetoric that led to the wrongful detention and deportation of the Windrush generation. “The government must stop using such language and misstating the law.” It highlighted the fact that the foreign affairs select committee – when Patel was a member – and the Windrush inquiry by Wendy Williams pointed out the dangers of wrongly using the language of criminality. It also states: “It is precisely the refusal to listen to evidence and advice, the refusal to recognise the humanity of those affected, and the same attitude which treats outside expertise and knowledge as opposition, which has led to chaos and dysfunction in the Home Office.” The UN’s refugee agency last night voiced dismay over the UK government’s posturing on an issue that most experts say involves only small numbers in asylum terms. Laura Padoan, of the UNHCR, said senior government figures needed to avoid “escalating tensions with inflammatory rhetoric and responses that are not proportionate to the scale of what’s happening”. The UN’s migration agency, the IOM, also cautioned that the government’s populist language hardened attitudes and could “feed into xenophobic narratives”. Although more than 4,000 people have crossed the Channel in at least 300 boats so far this year the UK received 35,566 asylum applications last year, while France received 123,900 and Germany 142,500."
2020-08-10T06:00:04Z,Q&A: what’s the real story behind recent UK refugee arrivals?,"Is it illegal to cross the channel to claim asylum? It’s complicated. First, it is not illegal to cross the Channel in a private boat but there are a number of strict requirements that need to be met. However, it is illegal to smuggle people into the UK. In many cases, people arriving in the UK would have paid a people-smuggler and they will not be meeting the requirements for an authorised crossing. Article 31 of the UN refugee convention states that people cannot be penalised for entering the country to claim asylum if they are “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened” provided they “present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence”. There is obviously a lot of debate over what constitutes the country people are “coming directly from”. But in 1999 a UK judge ruled that “some element of choice is indeed open to refugees as to where they may properly claim asylum”. The judge specified that “any merely short-term stopover en route” to another country should not forfeit the individual’s right to claim refugee status elsewhere. The ruling in effect meant people could legitimately make a claim for asylum in the UK after passing through other “safe” countries. Furthermore, international law also does not require asylum seekers to claim asylum in the first safe country they enter. This principle has been recognised in UK case law, and section 31 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 also provides a defence against prosecuting refugees for entering the UK. Is this a new issue? No. The number of small boats crossing the Channel has increased significantly in the last couple of years but the issue of refugees crossing the Channel is much more longstanding, with people trying to jump on to or under trains or conceal themselves in lorries for several years. Successive home secretaries have come under pressure from certain sections of the media on migrant Channel crossings. Exactly five years ago on 10 August 2015 the Guardian ran a front-page story about this. In January 2019 the immigration barrister Colin Yeo looked at the small boats issue. Media reports suggest many refugees are making a beeline for the UK. Is this correct? The UK is home to 1% of the world’s 29.6 million refugees. Asylum seekers make up a very small percentage of overall migrants to the UK with study and work cited as the main reasons why people want to come to the country, according to research from Oxford’s Migration Observatory. Asylum applications in the UK are relatively low – 35,099 in the year ending March 2020, significantly lower than a peak of 84,000 applications in 2002. Why don’t refugees who have made it to France just stay and claim asylum there? It is a safe country. Some of those travelling to the UK from France have only been in France for a matter of days, and some brought by smugglers from countries such as Iran or Iraq do not even know which European countries they have passed through. The smugglers, not the refugees, determine the final destination. Those who have spent time in France and have a specific plan to get to the UK may have family or community links or speak English. The asylum system in France has a reputation for being harsh. A ruling last month by the European court of human rights condemned France for inhuman living conditions for asylum seekers. At the end of the Brexit transition what will happen to current policy under the Dublin regulation, which allows the UK to return people to France or another European country if they spent time there before coming to the UK? At the moment no agreement on this issue has been drawn up between the UK and EU, so unless or until a replacement agreement is put in place the UK will no longer be able to remove people who arrive from northern France at the end of the Brexit transition period. Which countries are hosting the largest numbers of refugees? Turkey, Pakistan, Uganda and Sudan hosted the highest numbers of refugees at the end of 2018, while 85% of refugees live in the country bordering their own. In the last four months of 2019 Spain, France, Germany and Greece received the highest number of asylum applications in Europe, 74% of all the applications in Europe between them. The 1951 refugee convention guarantees the right to claim asylum and recognises that many refugees have to use irregular means to escape and seek sanctuary. There is no legal way to travel to the UK to seek asylum. Are most asylum seekers coming to the UK in small boats from northern France? Last year 35,566 people claimed asylum in the UK. But only an estimated 1,892 arrived in small boats. The top four countries for asylum claims in the year ending March 2020 were Iran, Albania, Iraq and Pakistan. While there are many Iranians and Iraqis in northern France hoping to seek asylum in the UK, those claiming asylum from countries such as Pakistan and Albania as well as other conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo are less likely to use this route. Not all nationals from countries such as Iran and Iraq travel overland from Europe to the UK. Some travel by other means such as on planes using false documents. Do we know exactly how many people are arriving in the UK on small boats? No. Although the Guardian understands that the Home Office has a flag on its internal systems to identify who has arrived in a small boat on the Channel, Home Office sources have confirmed to the Guardian that they do not publish annual or quarterly data on this. The snapshot figures released by the Home Office do not provide the full statistical picture. Which nationalities are coming to the UK in small boats? It is no coincidence that many of those risking their lives travelling in small boats have fled some of the world’s worst conflict zones or countries with appalling human rights records such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria."
2020-10-02T12:50:25Z,Matteo Salvini goes on trial over migrant kidnapping charges,"Italy’s far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini goes on trial on Saturday on kidnapping charges over an incident in 2019 when 116 migrants were prevented from disembarking a coastguard ship in the Mediterranean. Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania accuse the League party leader of abusing his powers to block people from disembarking from the Gregoretti coastguard boat under his “closed ports” policy. The 47-year-old called on his supporters to descend on the courtroom in Catania to protest against what he has described as a plot against him. “I will plead guilty to defending Italy and the Italians,” Salvini told the press last week. Fellow far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, has promised to attend the rally, while the ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who has faced several trials himself, will send a delegation from his Forza Italia party. Salvini’s fortunes have waned since he withdrew the League from its fractious governing alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in August 2019 in an attempt to capitalise upon his high poll ratings and seize the prime ministership. His rallies are disrupted by protesters and people often challenge him in the streets. As well as having his judgment questioned by people in his own party, he is embroiled in a series of legal wrangles, the majority connected to his tenure as a hardline interior minister. One of Salvini’s first moves when he took office in June 2018 was to declare Italian ports closed to ships engaged in rescuing people fleeing Libya by boat. There were subsequently 25 standoffs between rescue vessels and Italian authorities, some of which became the focus of criminal investigations. The case coming before the court on Saturday relates to a group of migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean in two separate operations on 25 June last year after five days at sea. There were 15 unaccompanied children among them. They were transferred to the Gregoretti on 26 July, then held on the overcrowded patrol vessel under a fierce summer sun – despite a scabies outbreak and a suspected case of tuberculosis. The unaccompanied children were allowed off on 29 July following pressure from Catania’s youth court. The remaining migrants disembarked 31 July after Salvini said a deal had been brokered with EU countries to take them. A few months later, the Catania prosecutor’s office placed Salvini under investigation and in February this year the Italian senate formally authorised criminal proceedings. His defence team insists the decision to hold the people on the ship was not Salvini’s alone, but reached collectively within the government. It will be up to a preliminary hearing judge to decide whether the case is strong enough to proceed with the trial. Observers say Salvini erred politically when he withdrew the League from government in August last year. He did not anticipate that the antiestablishment 5SM and centre-left Democratic party would put aside their deep enmity and go into coalition themselves, leaving the League on the opposition benches. “Once Salvini reached the peak of his rise, believing himself invincible, he lost his lucidity and made one mistake after another,” said Matteo Pucciarelli, a journalist at La Repubblica and author of a book about Salvini. “After kicking himself out of the government, he is now slowly losing the leadership of the right to Meloni.” Salvini’s attempts to keep his anti-migrant rhetoric front and centre in Italian politics this year, by linking the coronavirus pandemic to migrant arrivals, have failed to cut through. “The strategy to exploit migrants, citing they were threatening Italy by bringing Covid-19 with them, simply did not work,” said Pucciarelli. “Migrants were no longer at the top of the minds of Italians who have had more serious issues to think about during the pandemic.” Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Mercatorum University in Rome, said Salvini’s rhetoric around invading migrants infected with Covid-19 was not credible to Italians. “In addition, the management of the pandemic in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the coronavirus – and governed by the League - has been very controversial and characterised by numerous political errors,” Panarari said. “The fact that this region was governed by Salvini’s party has had a negative impact on its popularity.” Despite the setbacks, Salvini still has a strong support base and is expected to be able to rally thousands to his cause in Catania on Saturday. Asked recently whether he would prevent the disembarkation if he could go back in time, he replied: ‘‘It is not that I would do it again – I am going to do it again.”"
2020-10-01T14:37:49Z,"UK tested Channel ‘blockade’ to deter migrants, leak reveals","Trials have taken place to test a blockade in the Channel similar to Australia’s controversial “turn back the boats” tactic, according to official documents seen by the Guardian. The documents, produced in mid-September and marked “official” and “sensitive”, summarise advice from officials who were asked by Downing Street to consider “possible options for negotiating an offshore asylum processing facility similar to the Australian model in Papua New Guinea and Nauru”. In August it was reported that the home secretary, Priti Patel, was planning to approach French officials for cooperation in using Royal Navy and Border Force boats to block the path of refugees and migrants attempting to reach the UK in small boats. The document reveals this approach has been trialled. It reads: “Trials are currently under way to test a ‘blockade’ tactic in the Channel on the median line between French and UK waters, akin to the Australian ‘turn back’ tactic, whereby migrant boats would be physically prevented (most likely by one or more UK RHIBs [rigid hull inflatable boats] from entering UK waters.” The Australian policy was developed by the country’s former prime minister Tony Abbott, who was recently appointed as a UK government trade adviser. Operation Sovereign Borders involves turning back boats to the country of embarkation before they reach Australian waters. The Australian government considers the policy to be successful but it has been met with severe criticism from human rights groups. The Home Office has been approached for comment. The documents have been revealed by the Guardian at a time of increased tension over the UK’s asylum policy. Seven thousand migrants have arrived in the UK in small boats across the Channel so far this year, according to PA Media analysis – more than three times the number of arrivals by this route in the whole of 2019. The UK government has also launched a consultation with the maritime industry to explore constructing floating walls in the Channel to block asylum seekers from crossing the narrow strait from France, the Financial Times reported. An email from the trade body Maritime UK, obtained by the newspaper, reveals that the idea of floating barriers is being seriously pursued by Home Office officials. Maritime UK told the Guardian it had informed the Home Office that it did not think the proposal was “legally possible”. A Maritime UK spokesperson said: “As the umbrella organisation for UK maritime, we are a conduit between industry and government and are often asked by government for advice or input on policy matters. The Home Office engaged us to pass on a question around options to inhibit passage to UK territorial waters, which we gave to our members. The clear view, which we shared with the Home Office, was that as a matter of international convention, that this is not legally possible.” Downing Street said it would not comment on each of the leaked measures but said the government would soon bring forward “a package of measures” to address illegal migration once the UK has left the EU. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “We are developing plans around illegal migration and asylum to ensure that we’re able to provide protection to those who need it, while preventing abuse of the system and the criminality associated with it. “That includes looking at what a whole host of other countries do. But the work is ongoing. There’s an awful lot of speculation around today and I don’t plan on adding anything beyond that.” Downing Street said it did not recognise some of the more outlandish reporting – including the possibility of a wave machine in the Channel to push back migrants in small boats. “These things won’t be happening,” the spokesman said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the public will fully understand, we do not comment on operational matters because to do so could provide an advantage to the exploitative and ruthless criminals who facilitate these dangerous crossing, as they look for new ways to beat the system. “We are driving innovative tactics to deploy in every aspect of this operation, underlining the Government’s commitment to ending the viability of using small boats to illegally enter the UK.”"
2020-11-12T14:21:42Z,Thousands more refugees cross into Sudan to flee fighting in Ethiopia,"Thousands more refugees have fled fighting in northern Ethiopia’s Tigray region and crossed into neighbouring Sudan, as fears grow that conflict between national and provincial forces could prompt a serious humanitarian crisis. As many as 10,000 Ethiopians are now thought to have already crossed the border in the last two days, and aid officials say hundreds of thousands more are likely to leave their homes if the conflict, now entering its second week, does not end. Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, launched military operations in Tigray, after he accused local authorities of attacking a military camp in the region and attempting to loot military assets. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which is in power in the province, denies the attack and has accused the prime minister of concocting the story to justify deploying the offensive. Sudanese frontier officials described hungry and tired children, as well as casualties from the fighting, arriving in Sudan after a difficult journey. “More and more people, including wounded from the operations there, are still coming. The numbers are increasing rapidly. There are lots of children and women,” said Khalid Al-Sir, the head of the government refugee agency in Kassala state, in east Sudan. “They are arriving very tired and exhausted. They are hungry and thirsty since they have walked long distances on rugged terrain.” The situation on the ground is deteriorating rapidly, Sir said. One 30 year old border police officer described a day-long journey on foot with some 30 others fleeing, before spending two days in Sudan, exposed to the sun and wind in a border town that is quickly becoming overwhelmed. The fighting has involved clashes between ground troops, air strikes and artillery duels, with heavy casualties reported on both sides. Airports in Tigray are closed, roads blocked, internet services cut off and even banks are no longer operating. Sajjad Mohammad Sajid, the United Nations’ humanitarian chief in Ethiopia, said on Tuesday evening that long lines had appeared outside bread shops and supply-laden trucks are stuck at the province’s borders. Sajid told the Associated Press that up to 2 million people in the now isolated province were having a “very, very difficult time” and were short of fuel or food, or both. Telephone lines to the region were still down, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said in its latest report on the crisis. In a new statement on Thursday, Abiy claimed that the western part of the Tigray region had been liberated, and accused the TPLF rulers of seeking to “destroy Ethiopia.” The top U.S. diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, spoke with Ethiopia’s foreign minister on Wednesday “to urge again immediate action to restore peace and de-escalate tensions,” a State Department spokesperson said. Earlier this week, Abiy brushed aside requests from the UN, the UK and the African Union for an immediate end to hostilities. “Operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended [and] brought to justice,” Abiy posted on Twitter. Both sides have claimed successes, including federal troops taking an airport and Tigrayans alleging they downed a jet. With limited communications to the region and outsiders barred, it is difficult to verify such statements. The government has confirmed, however, that the TPLF is controlling a compound of the powerful Northern Command military in Tigray’s capital, Mekelle. “It looks like, unfortunately, this may not be something which can be resolved by any party in a week or two,” Sajid said. “It looks like it’s going to be a protracted conflict, which is a huge concern from the point of view of protection of civilians.” The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018. He won last year’s Nobel peace prize for ending a war with neighbouring Eritrea. The sweeping political reforms the 44-year-old former soldier pushed through won wide praise, but have allowed old ethnic and other grievances to surface. Tigrayan leaders have complained of being unfairly targeted in corruption prosecutions, removed from top positions and blamed for the country’s problems. The postponement of national elections due to the Covid-19 pandemic aggravated tensions and when parliamentarians in Addis Ababa, the capital, voted to extend officials’ mandates, Tigrayan leaders went ahead with regional elections in September that Abiy’s government deemed illegal. Both sides have access to heavy weapons, armour and considerable stocks of ammunition, and observers have warned that a lengthy conflict is possible. This would be immensely damaging to a fragile country, and region. The federal government on Thursday said some 150 suspected “operatives” accused of seeking to “strike fear and terror” throughout the country had been detained. The statement said the suspects “happen to be ethnically diverse,” but concerns remain high among ethnic Tigrayans amid reports of being singled out by authorities. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a global campaign group, called the arrests of the reporters “a dangerous reversal of the early steps taken by [the] government to improve press freedom”. The standoff leaves nearly 900 aid workers in the Tigray region struggling to contact the outside world, let alone bring in humanitarian supplies. There were already 100,000 internally displaced people and 600,000 dependent on food aid in Tigray before the conflict, aid agencies said."
2020-10-03T15:39:17Z,Italy's PM called to testify at Salvini migrant kidnap trial,"Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been summoned to testify in the trial of the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini, who is accused of kidnapping 131 migrants after he prevented them from disembarking from a coastguard ship in 2019. During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini repeatedly denied access to ports to ships carrying rescued migrants. The policy resulted in numerous standoffs, leaving migrants stuck at sea for weeks before European countries could identify a port that was willing to accept them, or courts intervened. On 25 July 2019, the coastguard ship Gregoretti was heading to Italy with more than 130 migrants on board, but once they arrived off the coast of Lampedusa, Salvini denied them permission to dock. The migrants and coastguard officers remained on the ship for six days. After sanitary conditions on the vessel became worrying, the migrants were authorised to disembark on the evening of 31 July. Sicilian prosecutors placed Salvini under investigation a few months later, and the Italian senate formally authorised criminal proceedings against the leader of the League in February. “I will plead guilty to defending Italy and the Italians,” Salvini told the press last week. The first preliminary hearing began on Saturday in a courtroom in Catania, and there was no shortage of controversies. Catania’s prosecutors, known for launching several investigations against rescue boats operated by aid groups and who in this trial should be arguing against Salvini, asked the judge to drop the charges. They said the decision to prevent the migrants from disembarking was political and was intended to “redistribute the passengers to other European countries”. Judge Nunzio Sarpietro, however, has decided he wants clarification, so he has summoned Conte, the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, and the former infrastructure and transport minister, Danilo Toninelli. All were part of the government at that time with Salvini, before he withdrew from the coalition. Salvini’s defence team insists that the decision to hold the people on the ship was not Salvini’s alone, but reached collectively from within the government. It will be up to a preliminary hearing judge to decide whether the case is strong enough for the trial to proceed. The first step is to understand whether Salvini acted alone, or if he was the simple executor of an agreed decision supported by the government at the time. Sarpietro has also requested the acquisition of other evidence relating to numerous cases in which Salvini prohibited the landing of migrants. Conte was called to testify at the next hearing on 20 November. “It was my first time in court as a potential culprit and defendant,” Salvini told the press after the trial. ‘‘Now, I keep going, with my head held high, certain that I have always acted in the defence of the homeland and for the safety of Italians.”"
2020-12-07T15:00:41Z,No Hard Feelings review – life lessons and love stories in a refugee shelter,"The winner of the Berlin film festival’s Teddy award for best queer-themed film begins as shuffling character study, then broadens out to resemble Jules et Jim or The Dreamers yanked brusquely into an urgent multicultural present. Its focal point is Parvis (Benjamin Radjaipour), a gay twentysomething German of Iranian descent obliged to assume greater responsibility after community service carries him into a refugee shelter; there he gravitates towards Amon (Eidin Jalali) and Banafshe (Banafshe Hourmazdi), Iranian siblings facing imminent deportation. Any trace of piousness in the setup is dispelled by an early, frenzied burst of man-on-man face-sitting: from the off, it’s a film caught between worlds, juggling Parvis’s casual hook-ups with his growing bond to contemporaries living more precariously. Presented in Academy ratio, with Andrea Arnold-like dreamy interludes, Faraz Shariat’s debut is quietly shrewd about checking its characters’ privilege. Dubbed an ausländer (foreigner) and living at home with uncomprehending parents, Parvis may think he has it bad, but he also has the paperwork allowing him to stay out at night. His soured fling with an older Caucasian contrasts with a scene in which Banafshe fends off an overreaching caseworker; the condescension and exploitation in play doesn’t appear wildly different. Gradually, that square frame becomes a window on to the European project itself. Sometimes those within it integrate, sometimes they struggle – though Shariat ensures their efforts yield a range of experiences, often as heady as they are chastening. So naturally does the film fall in step with its young leads – the director is only 26 himself – that it can feel callow in places. There’s a lot of aimless hanging out in the first half, and Shariat can’t resist the abiding visual cliche of Teddy award contenders: the overhead shot of photogenic players sprawled on their backs, heads resting in or near one another’s laps. Yet those players are strong, flicking eloquently and revealingly between German and Farsi, and the care taken to hear out Parvis’s parents – not hardline conservatives, but gentle souls (played by the director’s own family) whose hard work has afforded their offspring the opportunity to slope around – speaks to promising reserves of directorial curiosity and generosity. • No Hard Feelings is available on digital platforms from 7 December."
2020-08-20T18:33:16Z,The Guardian view on migrant deaths: hard hearts are cause for alarm | Editorial,"If anyone needed a reminder of what is at stake for the thousands of migrants and refugees trying to cross the Channel this summer, the circumstances surrounding the death of a young Sudanese man whose body was found on a beach near Calais have supplied it. The refugee, Abdulfatah Hamdallah, was found on Wednesday after trying to reach England in a dinghy with shovels for oars. Since people traffickers do not appear to have been involved, the tragedy has also revealed the mendacious inadequacy of the version of events being peddled by ministers. Their desperation to blame anyone but themselves for the present situation has resulted in an overemphasis on the role of smugglers and alleged failings by the French. Reports of the deaths of at least 45 people, including five children, off the coast of Libya, would be what the UN refugee agency has called the deadliest shipwreck in that stretch of water this year. The discovery of 10 dead people on another boat near the Canary Islands is a further reminder of the terrible hazards faced by those who flee their homes and countries in search of a better life for themselves and, increasingly, for their children. The range of the victims’ nationalities makes abundantly clear the problem’s global scale. While survivors in Libya were primarily said to come from Senegal, Mali, Chad and Ghana, recent arrivals in Kent have included people fleeing Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt and Syria. Obviously, there is no single solution to the multiple crises affecting countries around the world, one of the consequences of which is that millions of people are desperate to leave them. Just as obviously, the strategy most likely to lead to good outcomes is for countries to work together. This means long-term commitments to help poor countries to raise living standards and reduce conflict, as well as a joined-up approach to migration and the rights of refugees. For the UK government, one urgent priority must be to establish safe, legal means for asylum seekers to lodge claims. For the prime minister to denounce the current spate of Channel crossings as “dangerous and criminal”, while offering no alternative, is wrong in every way. A recent poll finding that 49% of British adults had little or no sympathy for Channel migrants offered an alarming glimpse of the extent to which hearts have hardened. Too much emphasis should never be placed on one survey, but the myths about migration are ingrained. Partly this is the result of deliberately inflammatory politics pursued over many years with a view to attracting voters thought to be hostile to immigration. To her shame, Priti Patel’s recent efforts in this vein won praise from Nigel Farage. But it also seems tangled up in many people’s confused image of the UK as simultaneously a put-upon small island and a global power. It is to their great discredit that ministers seem trapped in their own version of this, as they overreact to the increase in arrivals in Kent while making unrealistic demands of the EU, which has just rejected their proposal to extend current asylum arrangements beyond the transition period. Given that Germany last year registered 142,450 applications, almost three times the UK’s total of 44,250, it is little wonder that our neighbours have lost patience. Far more disturbing is the possibility that, in the nationalistic fug of Brexit, the UK government has lost sight of its international obligations and the basic standards of human decency they represent."
2020-09-01T18:50:58Z,'It's about finding a place': stunning portraits of women affected by the refugee crisis,"When Swedish nurse Israa Abdali got on a plane to war-torn Syria in 2016, she was shocked by what she saw. “Everything was destroyed, I couldn’t believe this was Syria,” said Abdali, who founded the NGO, Stand With Syria. “Every time you went out, you saw someone walking without legs and arms. Everyone lost something.” Now, a photo of Abdali and other young women who have been affected by the refugee crisis, is going on view in a new exhibition at Fotografiska in New York City. Between These Folded Walls, Utopia features a series of portraits of young women forced to migrate from the Middle East and Africa – countries like Afghanistan and Somalia – during the refugee crisis. On view are 18 framed photographs, six wall pieces and a film installation by Cooper &amp; Gorfer, a photography duo based in Gothenburg, Sweden, made up of two women: American artist Sarah Cooper and Austrian artist Nina Gorfer. “It’s about finding a place in different cultures and what it means to be a woman in all of this,” said Gorfer. Adds Cooper: “We wanted to address the time in our way, and witness how we were feeling in relation to our own community.” The duo began this project in 2017 after a conversation with one of their friends who is a teacher for young migrants. Several students were in limbo waiting for possible deportation (when a refugee turns 18, their child asylum status ends and young migrants can be sent back). For Cooper and Gorfer, it was time to invite young women to speak up. “We did a lot of interviews before we picked up a camera,” said Cooper. “Casual conversations. Not on-the-record until way later. In the beginning, it was a lot of talk about religion, feminism and gender equality. Prejudice and fear came up, too.” The goal was to give this younger generation a platform to not only be seen but be heard. “We wanted to focus on younger girls, a younger generation of refugees,” said Gorfer. “A group of girls is not usually heard, and we wanted to give them a voice. We not only wanted to make it about current refugees who came in 2015, but various stages of migration and immigration.” The photos have a sense of high-fashion glamour, like in the one of Abdali, whose shoulders are laden with yellow boxes in the portrait Israa With Yellow Boxes. As a nurse who entered Syria when many were running away from it, the boxes are meant to symbolize the heavy burden she has carried. “But she’s doing it for a better world,” said Gorfer. “She’s trying to create a better future, to imagine a better place for the people she has seen suffering on a daily basis.” The series is essentially about imagining a future self in times of migration and hardship. “Most of the time, it’s often with equality,” said Gorfer. She adds: “A lot of our talks with these women were about the kind of freedom you gain in a more liberal place like Sweden, like making a future for yourself, rather than a pre-described cultural role. A lot of women we met were finding their voice or using it.” Some of the portraits call to mind the diaristic paintings of Frida Kahlo, like in Segal and the Tiger, where a young woman reaches over her shoulder to write notes with hidden meanings. In another, Yohana and the Blanket, a young woman wears African-inspired garb, with a collaged cloak that points to her inner world. It depicts a woman named Yohana (who also is in the piece The Story of Yohana), which shows a young woman from the east African country of Eritrea, where thousands of youth are forced to life-long military service. Yohana fled the country through Sudan, Libya and across the Mediterranean sea in 2015, and is now studying in Sweden to work with children. “A lot of the girls were quite shy and just wanted to study, not focus on activism or their political role,” said Cooper. “But other women? You couldn’t stop them, as they had a statement to say. I felt through the process, we were able to give voice to all of them.” Over the course of their photo shoots, the photographers have watched the women’s ambitions grow from simple domestic goals to having a career and family. “A lot of our work deals with the idea of empowerment,” said Cooper. “We tend to work with a classical gaze of the woman gazing back at the viewer. We like the idea of women being Amazonian, it feels almost like they could crush you with their gaze.” Many of the photographs take cues from classical paintings. Mannerism, a 16th-century European art movement, was an influence. They look like decorative dreamscapes with dramatic drapery, regal poses and a lively, technicolor palette (rather than a deadpan, documentary style). Each photo tells the story of a young woman and her own first-hand experiences. “It’s vulnerable to have these young women be hung up in a museum, but at same time, we’re trying to allow them to be in control of their gaze,” said Cooper. “These photos are a labyrinth of tales that, layer upon layer, tells a story about their lives.” The women photographed are mostly from countries like Afghanistan, Somalia and Iran while others are first-generation Swedes with familial roots in these countries. The photo, titled Shadi or the Girl with Many Hands, shows Shadi, who is the daughter of Iranian political refugees from the time of the Shah, which was before the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s. It ties into their film installation, which features a group of dancers from the Gothenburg Opera, who symbolize Shadi’s inner turmoil. “It’s a dance of trust and distrust, harmony and disarray, of being our own worst enemy, the struggle to fit in and stand out,” said Cooper. “It’s the responsibility we feel being women, how things easily get piled up on us, and a struggle for your own voice.” The exhibition will be accompanied by a 15-minute short film co-directed by Cooper &amp; Gorfer, which features interviews with the women, who each tell their stories, from forced marriage to forced migration. In one segment, Abdali visits the island of Lesbos, Greece, to help save the lives of refugees who arrived by boat across the Mediterranean. She performed CPR on children who washed up on the shores of the island during the height of the refugee crisis. Abdali shares her viewpoint in the film: “We are humans in one place in one Earth,” she said. “And we should try to really think of us all as together, and maybe one day, exactly as you have helped people in need, maybe you will be in need.” Between These Folded Walls, Utopia is showing at Fotografiska in New York until 28 February"
2020-10-30T06:01:04Z,UN urges UK to restart resettlement of refugees after family drowns in Channel,"The UK government needs to urgently restart its resettlement scheme after two young children and their parents died while trying to cross the Channel, the UN refugee agency’s UK representative has said. Iranian Kurds Rasul Iran Nezhad and his wife, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, both 35, and two of their children, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, drowned on Tuesday as they tried to reach Britain by boat. The fate of the family’s third child, 15-month-old Artin, is unknown. Their deaths have led to renewed calls for the UK government to abandon its hardline approach to asylum seekers and expand or create safe and legal routes for migrants fleeing torture and death to travel to the UK and claim for protection. One such route would be the UK’s global resettlement scheme, which facilitates the transfer of recognised refugees from an asylum country to the UK with the aim of permanent settlement. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) assesses and grants refugee status. The scheme, which is supposed to resettle about 5,000 refugees a year, has been suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic. UNHCR’s UK representative, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, said: “UNHCR hopes that resettlement to the UK will restart very soon, once reception capacity is confirmed and any remaining logistical issues related to Covid are overcome by the authorities. The pandemic has presented new, acute hardships and uncertainties for refugees. “The tragic events in the Channel this week demonstrate again the need for concerted international efforts to address the complex root causes of displacement. Reopening and expanding legal pathways for more refugees to come to the UK in safety is one tangible way that this country can help.” Pagliuchi-Lor’s intervention comes as UNHCR launches a series highlighting the benefits of the UK’s community sponsorship programme. The programme, which has been running since 2016, enables community groups to become directly involved in supporting refugee families resettled in the UK through the currently suspended resettlement programme. “Community sponsorship is transformative,” said Pagliuchi-Lor. “It provides refugee families with a support network to help them adapt, learn and become independent more quickly. “But it also has a real effect on local volunteers, binding them together in a common cause and allowing them, in a small way, to be part of the global solution to forced displacement.” UNHCR travelled the UK last year chronicling the lives of five refugee families and their community supporters in Wales, Devon, Liverpool, Greater Manchester and London, and has pulled together images and videos for a series illustrating the scheme. More than 7,400 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, according to analysis by PA Media, nearly four times as many as in 2019. A record 416 arrived on a single day on 2 September. Seven migrants have died trying to cross the Channel this year, three more than last year. UNHCR joins groups such as Safe Passage, Amnesty and Choose Love/Help Refugees in calling for safe alternatives to the government’s current focus on physically obstructing the crossings. Other options, such as cross-border family reunion arrangements, are the best way to reduce the number of attempted crossings, the groups have said, although the UK government rejected amendments to its immigration bill as recently as last week that would have ensured that rights under British law to family reunion continued after the Brexit transition period. The Home Office has been approached for comment."
2020-10-23T05:00:01Z,Kent inspectors find wet and cold migrants held in cramped containers,"Hundreds of wet and cold migrants were forced to spend hours in cramped containers on a “rubble-strewn building site” after arriving in the UK on small boats, a report has revealed. In a rare insight into how newly arrived asylum seekers are treated by authorities, prison inspectors visited Tug Haven in Dover, where migrants are first taken from the beach or sea, and found a shortage of dry clothing and other basic supplies. Images show migrants queueing at Tug Haven surrounded by rubble and temporary fencing. Windowless shipping containers were used to hold the arrivals. More than 7,400 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, according to analysis by PA Media, nearly four times as many as in 2019, with a record 416 arriving on a single day on 2 September. All migrants are taken to Tug Haven for “processing” before heading to other short-term facilities. On the day of the inspection, 200 people arrived. The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said the numbers were no excuse for the conditions at Tug Haven and other sites, and criticised the Home Office for failing to plan “for what must have been a predictable increase” in arrivals from across the Channel. “Just because numbers are unprecedented, that does not mean they are unpredictable, or cannot be planned for,” he said. “While the number of arrivals had been far higher in 2020 than in previous years, the reception arrangements at Tug Haven were not fit for even small numbers. This was readily acknowledged by local Home Office staff, who were themselves working in challenging conditions.” Newly arrived detainees were triaged at Tug Haven for urgent medical conditions and symptoms of Covid-19, the report said. A designated van was available where migrants would be seated if they displayed any symptoms of the virus. Despite the poor conditions, the detainees – mainly from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Eritrea – who were interviewed by inspectors were almost all positive about the way individual staff at Tug Haven treated them. In September, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons visited short-term immigration detention holding facilities at Tug Haven, the Kent Intake Unit in Dover, Frontier House in Folkestone, Lunar House in Croydon and Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedford, which had been re-designated as a short-term holding facility. Inspectors said the Kent Intake Unit and Frontier House were not suitable for “very lengthy detentions” but some detainees were held for more than two days in rooms with no sleeping facilities, showers or access to the open air. Social distancing was not possible, and there were some basic omissions, inspectors said, such as not providing handwashing facilities or sanitiser in the women’s toilets. On average, children were held at the Kent Intake Unit for 17 hours, which was longer than the average for adults. In one case, a 15-year-old boy was held for over 66 hours. Other findings by the inspectors included: inspectors identified weaknesses in child safeguarding procedures and in one case a child was mistakenly taken to a detention centre for adults; children were held for too long and often overnight, partly because Kent county council’s social services department no longer has the capacity to care for unaccompanied minors; one family group, held in Frontier House for 45 hours, included a baby and other children, aged five, seven, nine and 10; detainees arriving at Tug Haven routinely had their mobile phones confiscated, while detainees in Yarl’s Wood are banned from using social media; Tinsley House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick, is now receiving small boat arrivals. Bridget Chapman, a caseworker and spokesperson for Kent Refugee Action Network, said the report contained “a litany of serious problems”. “As a charity working with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Kent, it is our duty to speak up on their behalf, and we would like a reassurance that this terrible and dangerous mistake will not be repeated. “Asylum-seeking people are arriving here seeking sanctuary. Instead of taking care of them, the government is placing them in what amounts to inhuman and degrading conditions. This shames us all and has to be rectified with immediate effect.” Minnie Rahman, public affairs and campaigns manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: “The Home Office could and should take simple, practical steps to treat newly arrived asylum seekers with humanity: house them, support them and process their claims properly. Instead, politicians are neglecting people’s basic needs while at the same time using them as fodder for their PR cannon, releasing laughable proposals to send people thousands of miles away or put wave machines in the Channel just so they can ‘look tough’ on immigration.”"
2020-07-03T05:30:13Z,Refugee victims of Tajoura bombing still lie in unmarked graves one year on,"One year on from the migrant detention centre bombing in Tajoura, eastern Tripoli, dozens of refugees and migrants who died have never been formally identified. At least 53 people were killed and 130 injured on the night of 2 July 2019, according to the UN, after an airstrike by a foreign aircraft supporting eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar’s forces hit a hall where migrants and refugees were locked up. Many of the victims had previously tried to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, but were caught and returned by the Libyan coastguard, which is supported by the European Union. Dozens of the dead were buried in graves marked only with a serial number; according to aid workers, no attempts were made to contact their relatives. Though several were carrying identification, the only victim whose full name became public appears to be an Ethiopian woman who was named by local media as Najaax Cabdi Sugaale. “When it comes to migrants it’s close to impossible here because most don’t have relatives in the country, they don’t have identification,” said an aid worker, on condition of anonymity. “So it becomes close to impossible to do any forensic response here. That was the case when this tragic incident happened last year. The authorities were not able to respond by the book, as most of the resources were not available [to them].” “To my knowledge, nobody took charge of this,” said another source. Survivors still in Libya planned to light candles, but were unable to properly mark the one-year anniversary on Thursday due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some sent messages to the Guardian asking for help. “We suffered a lot,” said one South Sudanese man. “We want to be out of this country in [a] safe place. We are not demanding specific countries or continents, but out of Libya.” A report by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) – whose spokespeople did not respond to a request for an interview – described the aftermath of the bombing. “Upon entering the crime scene, we noticed the presence of human body parts, blood and debris spread in a chaotic way in the targeted location.” The report listed the death toll as 37. At the time, fighters and militias associated with the GNA were fighting forces associated with Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army. Survivors say the number of people who died was much higher, with at least 10 witnesses telling the Guardian they believe the death toll was above 100. “It’s sad to think that lives were lost that day and a lot of those people, a lot of those faces, are going to remain anonymous,” said Safa Msehli, a spokesperson with the International Organization for Migration. “We worked very closely with the Libyan Red Crescent and our staff, who were on location after the tragedy happened, were describing a horrific scene of body parts, faces disfigured … There’s no official registry of who is detained there [in Libya]. It leads to the wider issue of arbitrary arrests in Libya. There’s no clear process and no clarity on who is conducting these arrests and for what reason.” Msehli said at least 40 survivors, including those injured, returned to the countries they originally came from after the bombing. Tarik Argaz, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), said 58 survivors have since been moved to other countries: either Italy or to transit centres in Niger and Rwanda. Another 88 were due to be evacuated, he said, but that “was put on hold until the resumption of air traffic”. Dozens more paid smugglers to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. At least two drowned, according to others who made the journey. One Sudanese man, now in France, said his asylum claim has already been rejected. “We thank God for our salvation from the hell of Libya and curse him for our fall in the hell of Europe,” he said."
2020-10-21T14:50:58Z,Appeal court quashes UK policy of removing migrants with little warning,"The court of appeal has quashed a Home Office policy of removing migrants from the UK without access to justice. In a unanimous decision, three judges found the policy, which allowed the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK sometimes with only hours notice and in many cases without access to lawyers, to be unlawful. More than 40,000 removals were affected by the policy, resulting in vulnerable people being put at risk. Some were recognised as having been removed unlawfully, were brought back to the UK and granted leave to remain. Wednesday’s ruling will be a blow for the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has vowed to take a tough line on removing migrants from the UK. It also comes at a time when she has been reported to be considering making some definitions of human rights law for judges rather than leaving judges to decide these legal points for themselves. The judgment from the lord chief justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Hickinbottom and Lord Justice Coulson emphasises the importance of the right of access to justice under common law: “The right to access the court is an absolute and inviolable right … the right to access to the court is not a relative right to be balanced against other rights and interests.” The Home Office policy that has been quashed includes “removal windows”, whereby someone is given as little as 72 hours notice that they might be removed from the UK at some point during the subsequent three months, without any warning. The appeal court challenge was brought by the charity Medical Justice, the Public Law Project and Duncan Lewis solicitors. A Medical Justice spokesperson said: “One of our society’s most precious treasures is access to justice. Chillingly, away from the public gaze, this policy denied that fundamental right on a massive scale causing serious harm to extremely vulnerable people and risking life. It was effectively a shortcut to removal. Quashing the policy brings us back towards equal access to justice for all.” Rakesh Singh, a solicitor at the Public Law Project, said: “This is a case about access to justice, one of the fundamental values of the British constitution. The ‘removal windows’ policy shut people out of the legal process. It meant that when mistakes were made, people could not access the court to put things right, and led the Home Office to remove people with a right to be here – including a number who were caught up in the Windrush situation. “Removing people in this way caused terrible injustices and placed many individuals and families in danger and into hardship, unnecessarily and unjustly.” Raja Uruthiravinayagan of Duncan Lewis solicitors said: ‘The importance of this judgment cannot be overstated. Access to justice is a fundamental principle of rule of law. Without it, individuals will not be able to challenge unlawful decisions and hold decision-makers accountable. It protects our fundamental rights and freedoms. The delivery of justice should be impartial and non-discriminatory, regardless of who is seeking it, if it is to protect and strengthen our democracy.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our immigration and asylum system is fundamentally broken and we are determined to introduce a new system that is fair, firm and will expedite the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection.” Home Office sources said the court found that the removal windows interfered with an individual’s access to legal advice. It did not find that removal windows were unlawful. • This article was amended on 28 October 2020. An earlier version said that the policy could allow the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK within hours; this has been clarified to say the removal could be with only hours notice."
2020-12-02T14:15:27Z,'I saw people dying on the road': Tigray's traumatised war refugees,"When Ethiopia’s army shelled Humera, a small agricultural city in Tigray, in mid-November, 54-year-old Gush Tela rushed his wife and three children to safety in a nearby town. A few days later, he felt compelled to find out what had become of his home. As he approached the city on his motorbike, riding through the arid countryside, he said the stench of countless dead bodies filled the air. Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said. “I saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,” Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. “I saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.” Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region’s ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies. Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents – and who was responsible. On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia’s government had signed a deal to allow “unimpeded” humanitarian access to Tigray – at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people. Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. “I was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,” he said. “I never felt this situation would ever happen.” Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba. Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces. At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia’s governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency. About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted. Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies. Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from Médecins Sans Frontières. “It’s almost two crisis on top of each other,” he said. “We are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.” Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa’s second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility. Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and “finishing” Tigrayans. The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes. Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia. For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. “It was very successful,” he said. “I was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.” Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. “But those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,” he said. With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet. He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. “It’s been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we’re serving 200 patients,” he said. “We’re running out of drugs every time, so we’re using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.” Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. “Respiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.” Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. “We were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,” he said. Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren’t accessing treatment. Women’s reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap. Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray’s leadership. Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias. She accused Abiy of exploiting ethnic divisions and fuelling resentment. “It is purely ethnic,” she said. “The country was fair but Abiy wanted all the power. The government made it seem that the problems with Ethiopia were because of Tigray.” The rest of her family remains in Tigray. “My life is there, my family,” she said. “I’m just waiting to see if things improve.”"
