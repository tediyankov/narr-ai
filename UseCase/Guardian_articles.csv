2015-12-17T08:44:33Z,Where media fails on the reporting of migrants and refugees,"Journalists who report on the global migration and refugee crisis often fail to tell the full story and routinely fall into propaganda traps laid by politicians, according to a report published by the Ethical Journalism Network (EJN). “Around the world, media coverage is often politically led with journalists following an agenda dominated by loose language and talk of invasion and swarms,” said Aidan White, EJN’s director. But it doesn’t have to be like that. As White said: “At other moments the story is laced with humanity, empathy and a focus on the suffering of those involved.” The 100-page report, Moving Stories, has been released just ahead of the United Nations-sponsored International Migrants Day on Friday 18 December. It reviews media coverage of migration in the European Union and in 14 countries across the world. Among the topics it highlights are: Missed opportunities: How European media outlets failed to raise the alarm about an imminent influx of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq, even though the story was there to be told a year before the crisis broke in 2015. Hate speech: How malevolent anti-migrant or anti-Muslim statements by politicians like Donald Trump in the United States and some European leaders fuelled increasing public concern and hijacked media coverage. Falling standards: How media failed to provide detailed and reliable information about the refugee crisis because of stretched editorial resources or due to the lack of presence of well-informed journalists able to provide in-depth and sensitive reporting; Sensationalism: How much journalism is driven by hyperbole, intolerance and distortion with media in confusion over what are the correct terms to use to describe migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. To counter these problems, the report recommends that news media take urgent action to appoint specialist reporters to the migration beat. It also calls for industry wide and in-house training on migration issues and problems of hate-speech; improved links with migrant and refugee groups; and more employment of journalists from ethnic minority communities to strengthen diversity in newsrooms. The report highlights how media coverage, much of it negative and focused on numbers of migrants on the move, took a dramatic turn with the death of Alan Kurdi and the publication of pictures of his body on a beach in Turkey. It was only from that moment that editors woke up to the human tragedy within the migration story. In his foreword to the report Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, sums up the challenge facing media: “It is not just a lack of humanity on the news agenda or a matter of luck or a matter of caring more about some people at the expense of others. We need a broader lens to see what really is going on. The reports states: “There is a tendency, both among many politicians and in sections of the mainstream media, to lump migrants together and present them as a seemingly endless tide of people who will steal jobs, become a burden on the state and ultimately threaten the native way of life. “Such reporting is not only wrong; it is also dishonest. Migrants often bring enormous benefits to their adopted countries.” Download the full report HERE"
2015-11-05T20:05:28Z,Diane Abbott: economic migrants and refugees deserve equal sympathy,"Economic migrants coming to Britain should be treated with the same sympathy as refugees fleeing war, Diane Abbott has said. The shadow international development secretary also said it is wrong and racist to claim, as some of her colleagues in the Labour party had done previously, that eastern European immigrants were the cause of wage cuts for English workers. Abbott was speaking on Thursday at an event to welcome refugees in north London also attended by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The refugee and immigration issue is likely to be controversial as Labour seeks to defeat a Ukip challenge in next month’s Oldham West byelection, triggered by the death of Michael Meacher. She said: “I would remind you, thousands of people crossing the Sahara, risking their lives in the Mediterranean, coming over the Balkans, are also economic migrants and we do not want to fall into the error of thinking that refugees are in some sense a class of migrant more deserving of our sympathy. “Just as our hearts goes out to Syrians struggling, dying, suffering and drowning, our hearts should also go out to economic migrants in Nigeria, Eritrea and north Africa, struggling, drowning and suffering. Economic migrants are not a lesser cause.” She said the migration crisis had been caused by problems such as climate change and instability, but “above all there are issues with a series of ill-fated western interventions in Libya, Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East”. The European Union is predicting that there will be as many as 3 million refugees arriving in Europe next year. Without naming any individual, Abbott also criticised “those in the Labour party that seem to want to argue that immigrants are in some sense the cause of our economic woes”. She said: “This is something I deplore. Immigrants in and of themselves do not cause low wages. Predatory employers, deregulated labour markets and weakened trade unions – they cause low wages.” She argued that some people, including members of the Labour party, wrongly contend that the current debate about immigration is not about race by pointing to the fact that eastern Europeans are white. Abbott said: “I would refer them to the toxic anti-Irish racism of the 19th century – the way the Irish were dehumanised and caricatured. Every single allegation made against the eastern Europeans – they were undercutting local labour, they were driving down wages, that they were the cause of the problems of the English working class – every single allegation that you hear made against eastern European migrants today, they said about the Irish in the 19th century. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.” The government’s response to the crisis was inadequate because the refugee conversation had been poisoned by the toxic debate about immigration year after year, she said. Abbott added that it was hypocritical of neoliberals to wring their hands about the effects of eastern Europeans on wages, since it was the liberalisation of labour markets and the weakening of trade unions that were the real culprits. She described Corbyn as “the first authentically leftwing leader of the Labour party in a generation”. Speaking at the event, Corbyn said his success in the Labour leadership election showed “the politics of me, not we, are over”. “It was a victory not for me, but for all those that want to see a different, better and more peaceful world,” he said. He called on Britain to “hold out the hand of humanity and not brutality to refugees. I do not use the language of swarm and swamp and all those things. I look at those people as fellow human beings, just like you, just like me, just doing their best to survive in a cruel and dangerous world”. Corbyn said David Cameron’s pledge to take in up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years was inadequate, pointing to the hundreds of thousands being granted asylum by Germany and urging the government to assist local councils in giving a place of safety to refugees in the UK. He insisted he held no brief for those fighting in Syria, and said he only wanted peace in the region. “Further bombing, further interventions, further boots on the ground, further wars is not going to solve the problem. All wars have to end by a political solution,” Corbyn added. Without specifying how many refugees the British government should take, the Labour leader pointed out that Germany has taken hundreds of thousands of refugees and Britain should be doing more. He said: “Refugees should not be treated as a problem, a threat, a difficulty and somehow or other to be confronted and kept out.“The problem across Europe will not be solved by the construction of razor-wire fences around countries, by having gun boats in the sea and by having electronic surveillance and tagging of people all across the world that are trying to achieve a place of safety.” The solution lay “in greater equality and above all by ending the series of wars that have disfigured this century so far,” Corbyn added."
2015-08-28T15:51:21Z,"Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers: what's the difference?","In the current migration crisis, the terms “migrant”, “refugee” and less commonly “asylum seeker” are used daily to mean one and the same thing. Each term, however, has a distinct meaning that carries different international obligations and consequences. If conflated, it can mean the difference between life and death. So what are thoe differences? Migrant At its simplest, a migrant is someone who moves from one place to another in order to live in another country for more than a year. The International Organisation of Migration estimates that 232 million people a year become international migrants and another 740 million move within their own countries. The are many reasons that people become migrants, but those who move to work or seek a better life are generally termed economic migrants. There are, however, also international students, those who move for family reasons and those who migrate because they are fleeing war and persecution. An individual case can be a mixture of all those things. It is, after all, possible to flee the war in Syria and want a better life for your family. Migrants from outside the EU are subject to immigration controls and may need a visa to enter certain countries, including Britain. They do not have immediate access to social housing or benefits, but may have an eventual pathway to settlement and citizenship. They can also be detained or deported if they fail to comply with immigration laws. Just over 636,000 migrants arrived in Britain in the past 12 months, according to the latest figures, which included 25,000 asylum seekers. Once migrants arrive in a country such as Britain there is little agreement over what the word covers. In the past “immigrant” has meant someone who intends to settle in a new country. “Migrant” has been increasingly adopted to cover those who come to work for a short period then return home. “The migrant population” is used to describe foreign nationals resident in a country, but also those who are foreign-born residents even if they have become citizens. Refugee A refugee is a person who has fled armed conflict or persecution and who is recognised as needing of international protection because it is too dangerous for them to return home. They are protected under international law by the 1951 refugee convention, which defines what a refugee is and outlines the basic rights afforded to them. The convention’s basic principle is that refugees should not be expelled or returned to situations where their life and freedom would be under threat. Once someone has been recognised as a refugee, they are supposed to be given access to social housing and welfare benefits and helped to find a job and integrate into society. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that there are almost 60 million forcibly displaced people around the world, including those displaced within their own countries. Asylum seeker States are under international obligation to consider claims for asylum and not to immediately return asylum seekers to the countries they have fled from. The refugee convention states that they must be given access to fair and efficient asylum procedures and measures to ensure they live in dignity and safety while their claims are processed. In the UK in practice this means living in no-choice accommodation outside London and south-east England on a minimal level of social security."
2015-09-04T08:20:59Z,"Refugees are Australia's most entrepreneurial migrants, says research","Refugees are not taking Australian jobs, they are creating new ones, according to new government research that reveals humanitarian arrivals are the country’s most entrepreneurial migrants. People from the UK and India – most of whom arrived on skilled or family visas – contributed the largest share of the $38bn earned by migrants in Australia in 2009-10, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released on Friday, reveals. But it was migrants who arrived as refugees who reported the highest proportion of their incomes that year “from their own unincorporated businesses”. This income grew with the length of time they spent in Australia, and “increased sharply” after five years of residency. The report built on earlier research showing humanitarian migrants tended to work several jobs in their first few years in Australia to build capital to start their own businesses, the ABS said. One such entrepreneur is Bassam Jabbar, who recently arrived from Iraq, and with the help of Settlement Services International (SSI), has established a glass-etching artwork business. He told Guardian Australia the biggest hurdle to starting a business was “knowing the country, knowing how people think, the regulations”. “Refugees have left their country, their society, their language behind and so of course they find it easier to work in their own business – especially artists,” he said. Nearly 10% of humanitarian migrants’ incomes in 2009-10 were generated by their own businesses, almost twice the figure recorded in other categories, such as skilled and family migrants. This income was overwhelmingly made by men, most aged between 25 and 44. Afghans earned the largest share of the profits generated by humanitarian migrant businesses. Violet Roumeliotis, the chief executive of SSI, said she “wasn’t surprised at all” by the data. “Being from countries where they need to be enterprising to survive, because there’s no welfare state, refugees are keen to pick an area of passion or where they have a skill and start a business,” she said."
2015-11-19T14:09:16Z,Aid groups say Balkan states blocking refugees based on nationality,"Countries along the Balkan migration trail have begun refusing to admit people of certain nationalities, amid a backlash against refugees in the aftermath of the Paris attacks last Friday. Humanitarian workers active along the borders of Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia reported that refugees and migrants from countries other than Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq were now being stopped, raising the spectre of a migrant logjam in Greece. The move comes after Slovenia, the most northerly country along the trail, suddenly tried to return 168 Moroccan migrants to Croatia on Thursday, in the first major development along the Balkan migration route since Hungary shut its border in September. The decision sparked panic among the countries to Slovenia’s south, who feared that Slovenia was about to block access to anyone who could not easily prove their need for refugee status, and consequently turned back all migrants from Africa and southern Asia. Slovenia said on Thursday afternoon it had not made any permanent decisions, and promised to admit refugees as long as Germany and Austria continued to subsequently take them. But a police spokesman confirmed that Slovenia would discuss with its Balkan neighbours how to limit the flow of so-called economic migrants in the future. “We absolutely need to provide protection to those who need it, whose lives are threatened, who are escaping war zones,” said a spokesman for the Slovenian interior ministry. “For others we will need to reach an agreement on how to respond. No country has limitless capacity, so the capacity should be for those whose lives are really in need.” For now, campaigners on the ground said people from Africa, Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh – who collectively amount to less than 10% of the flow through the Balkans, according to the UN – were already trapped in limbo at the borders of Croatia, Serbia, and Macedonia, since the three countries did not want to risk the possibility of anyone being stuck on their territory. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Macedonia had begun to build a barrier along its southern border with Greece. A spokeswoman for the Macedonian interior ministry denied any such barrier was being built, but MSF’s team leader on the border said it was clear that some kind of obstacle was being constructed. “It’s obvious that they want to do something,” said MSF’s Antonis Rigas. “Every 20 metres they’ve put out stones. What for? They haven’t started the construction, but I’m an engineer, and I can say it’s there for something.” Earlier in the week, Macedonia’s cabinet said it was considering whether to build a fence. But it claimed that such a fence, if built, would be used to block the passage of migrants only if upstream countries did the same, risking a bottleneck on Macedonian territory. Serbia has promised not to build a fence, but Slovenia is preparing one in order to better control the flow of refugees. Hungary completed work on a fence in mid-September, causing the refugee route to swerve westwards into Croatia. Should the Balkan countries block the route entirely, Greece may be forced to deal with a logjam of refugees. An average of 4,750 people a day have arrived on its shores from Turkey this month, down from the October average of 6,800 but above the August daily rate of 3,500. Though their problems have received less attention than those of Syrians, many refugees from Africa and south Asia claim to be fleeing human rights abuses. A backlash against migrants and refugees has intensified after a passport used by a migrant to enter Greece in early October was found near the body of a dead bomber in Paris. Police are not yet sure whether the passport holder was a the terrorist. But the uncertainty has led to fears about the threat posed by thousands of undocumented migrants entering Europe’s south-eastern borders, some of whom carry fake documentation. A spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the Balkan countries risked failing to uphold the UN convention on refugees should they begin to screen arrivals on the basis of their origin. “It is important that every individual who is seeking asylum has access to a fair and efficient asylum procedure, regardless of their nationality,” the spokeswoman said. “UNCHR is monitoring the situation and recommending governments that each case is decided based on its predicaments not on the nationality of the asylum seeker. All countries along the Balkans route are signatories to the 1951 convention and UNHCR has been working with the government to build their asylum systems.” Over 600,000 people have so far attempted to walk through the Balkans after landing in Greece in 2015."
2015-12-11T10:42:07Z,"The media needs to tell the truth on migration, not peddle myths | Alberto Nardelli","Over the past week a lot has been said about the success of the far-right Front National at the French regional elections, while the reaction to Donald Trump’s increasingly discriminatory tone has, rightly, been one mostly of disgust. We are right to stand up to the Le Pens and Trumps of this world. When they splutter remarks that are incendiary and false, we have a responsibility to correct their inaccuracies. The reasons why the ideas of the Front National take hold are plentiful and complicated. There is no single simple explanation. However, there can be no doubt that misinformation does not help – and we in the media should feel a professional and moral obligation to confront our own industry when it misleads. The front page of Thursday’s Times of London splashed: “EU buckles as Merkel’s migrants hit 1 million.” The headline topped an article about comments made by the UK prime minister, David Cameron, who said that net migration of 300,000 a year was not sustainable in Britain. The piece also referenced demands that Cameron is making to other European leaders to apply restrictions to EU nationals’ access to UK’s welfare. The Times story pieces together different stories and conflates a range of issues. The result is a distasteful minestrone. First, the one million figure refers to the number of asylum seekers that have arrived in Germany so far this year. The majority of these are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. They are refugees fleeing wars. Second, whatever one thinks of Britain’s level of migration - whether it is too high or not is besides the point - the number has little to do with refugees. The UK hardly takes any refugees. In fact fewer than 5% of migrants to Britain over the past year were asylum seekers. Third, we can state with certainty that refugees escaping conflict are not doing so to claim in-work tax credits. Fourth, the migrants are Angela Merkel’s only insofar as Germany is one of a handful of countries that is welcoming refugees instead of putting up fences, turning the other way, or, like Britain, taking in pitifully low numbers. The problem with the article is more than just a question of interpretation or of cavalier use of terms. Facts without humanity are meaningless. The choice of words we use matters and carries consequences. Behind the use of words like “migrant”, “refugee”, “asylum seeker”, “people”, “swarms” and “floods”, there is powerful symbolism. When terms used for people fleeing war, violence and atrocities, or those used for people moving in search of work, or a better life, become pejorative and generate antipathy, we have a problem. We are choosing not to unite around a shared purpose, but to drive a wedge through society. We are taking an us v them view on the world. There are grave risks when the perception of an issue and facts do not align. It doesn’t matter if the misalignment creates the idea of a country that isn’t grounded in reality – when untruths are repeated often enough they generate fear among people. In turn this defines and drives behaviour. Consider these facts: Britons believe that 23% of migrants are coming to UK to seek asylum while the actual proportion is less than 5% Nearly 40% of Europeans cite immigration as the issue of most concern facing the EU – more than any other issue. Only a year ago, less than 25% of people said the same. One in two of the British public mention immigration as among the most important issues facing the country. Most Europeans greatly overestimate the proportion of their country’s population that is comprised of migrants. The Times of course is not alone. Nearly every day we read headlines about the true toll of mass migration on UK life, the crisis in our schools, the swarms on our streets, migrants stealing our jobs, draining the NHS and fuelling a surge in crime – all actual headlines. Last week a journalist fabricated a tale in order to be able to claim that he had travelled along a refugee route without a passport. This is how far we have come. The same newspaper that carried that particular story (for which it has apologised), had only weeks earlier controversially led with “1 in 5 Brit Muslim’s sympathy for jihadis”. The point is this: the likes of Le Pen and Trump are not a product of the media. However, too often the media provides them with the ammunition and fertile ground that they require to thrive. Don’t take my word for it. Take Trump’s: During a trip to Europe in the 1930s a young John F Kennedy wrote a letter to a friend. In it he said: “It seems so easy to fall into a distorted view of public affairs based more on personal bias than on informed understanding.” The challenge we face is not new. But it is one that remains not only critical, it is one we have mostly failed to meet. If we want to confront the Le Pens and Trumps of this world then we need to change the way we talk about the people that they vilify."
2015-10-19T00:02:01Z,"Battle for Aleppo threatens to create fresh refugee exodus, says Turkish PM","The battle for Aleppo, compounded by Russian airstrikes on the city, threatens to create a new refugee exodus from Syria, Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, has warned. Speaking after talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Davutoğlu called for action to prevent a new wave of refugees from moving north across the Turkish border. Aleppo is under assault both from Isis and from forces backing the Syrian government, including Iranian fighters and Russian aircraft. As the influx of refugees into Europe continued, Hungary closed its border with Croatia at the weekend, forcing thousands of migrants to find a new route to through Slovenia and into Austria. On Sunday, Slovenia said it would restrict its intake to 2,500 arrivals a day to ease pressure on both its own and Austria’s borders. The decision caused delays further down the migrant trail, raising fears of human bottlenecks. Davutoğlu said on Sunday: “It is our priority that steps will be taken to prevent an increase of refugees from Aleppo due to the offensive [there] by Iranian militia, Isis and Russian attacks.” “Aleppo is Syria’s second-biggest city. The [Russian] airstrikes in and around Aleppo as well as the Isis attack on the city worry us. They could cause another wave of refugees.” Merkel said Germany was prepared to accelerate accession process for Turkey’s membership of EU in exchange for Turkish help to secure European borders and to make sure that fewer refugees reach Europe. “How can we organise the accession process more dynamically?” Merkel asked at the press conference in Istanbul. “Germany is ready to open chapter 17 this year, and to make preparations for [chapters] 23 and 24. We can talk about the details,” she added, referring to EU accession procedures. Faced with a record influx of refugees this year, Germany is keen for countries on the migration frontline – particularly Turkey and Greece – to deal with the problem there rather than export it north. The onward passage of refugees through the Balkans towards central Europe in recent weeks has placed huge pressure on transit countries. Human rights groups have condemned the European plan for ignoring the rights of refugees. “Talks between the EU and Turkey on ‘migration management’ risk putting the rights of refugees a distant second behind border control measures designed to prevent refugees from reaching the EU,” Andrew Gardner, Turkey researcher for Amnesty International said on Saturday. Davutoğlu said Turkey was prepared to cooperate with Germany and the EU to prevent illegal migration, but underlined that the refugee crisis could not be solved without finding a solution to the war in Syria. Pointing out that Turkey has more than two million Syrian refugees and has spent approximately $7.5bn (£5bn) since the refugee crisis began, he said the international community needed to show more support. The government in Ljubljana said it had refused on Sunday to allow in a train carrying 1,800 migrants from Croatia, after more than 3,000 people surged into the tiny EU member state the day before. German police union chief Rainer Wendt told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper Germany should build a fence along its border with Austria. “If we close our borders this way, Austria will also close its border with Slovenia, and that’s exactly the effect we need,” he said. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"
2015-12-20T09:00:48Z,Prejudice against migrants speaks 311 different languages,"Did you know that the English language is “starting to die out” in British schools; indeed, that in some of them “English is barely heard at all”? Answer yes if you read a Daily Express front page “special investigation” that reported 311 different tongues apparently spoken in our classrooms. Answer no if you read last week’s Independent Press Standards Organisation verdict on the tale, which found it “inaccurate” and “completely unsupported” by the cited data. Commodious correction with front page presence enforced. Good for Ipso, you may say. At least the Voice of Desmond must fall silent for five minutes or so. But then put this finding in a wider, more dismaying context. “ Moving Stories” – a new report from the Ethical Journalism Network – sets media coverage of refugee crises and migrant flows in exactly that broader landscape and duly seeks many, rather obvious, reforms: expertise, particular care, training, access, increased resources. In sum, standard ethical answers to ethical dilemmas. But, then again, the report’s recommendations can’t be more compelling than the basic situation it outlines – one which changes from country to country, from Turkey to the Gambia to China; lands where migration and attitudes to it vary profoundly. What you think about it depends on where you sit. There is no One Problem: there are countless different problems. And that is our special problem. Which columnist said: “I don’t care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don’t care … these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit ‘Bob Geldof’s Ethiopia circa 1984’, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors”? Which big TV channel warned that “Islamic State is flooding Europe with refugees”? Which prime minister warned that “two million refugees are waiting on the border”? That first, now notorious, quote comes, of course, from Katie Hopkins in the Sun. But the television news headline is Bulgarian, as is the PM with two million on his mind. And Moving Stories has many more grisly examples – from Italy to the inevitable US – of supposed fact stewed in fear, hate and botched perception. What’s to be done (apart from building checklists)? The Italian Carta di Roma, an agreement on responsible coverage of the refugee crisis between many of Italy’s major media players, damns “inaccurate, simplified or distorted information” in clause 1. The editors’ code at Ipso in Britain echoes almost exactly the same formula, with “misleading” instead of “simplified”. There’s no rocket science here. Facts on refugee numbers, refugee plights, refugee solutions are vital. Facts on migrant languages, migrant assimilation, migrant children are vital, too. Of course it’s all difficult: too many national standpoints, too many myths, too much misunderstanding-cum-malice. Of course one person’s fact can be another person’s prejudice. But don’t hide modest satisfaction when the woolliest yarns are disentangled. Make a new passion for fact-checking the theme song of 2016. Leveson: the force doesn’t reawaken After Part One, you’ll remember, there was supposed to be Leveson Part Two. But settle down at the back. Various reasons for a pronounced lack of action can be evinced. Judges (least of all Sir Brian) see no point in presiding over such arid revels. Governments manifest nil enthusiasm for finding the cash. But the basic reasons for total forgetfulness lie in the original briefs. Stage Two was supposed to examine “the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other media organisations or other organisations. It will also consider the extent to which any relevant police force investigated allegations relating to News International, and whether the police received corrupt payments or were otherwise complicit in misconduct.” Well, we sort of know what happened inside News International. See the decision not to pursue criminal corporate proceedings. And we know how the trail ran dry at Trinity Mirror (though not, of course, the mighty legal tsunami of civil claims still washing up on the Mirror’s beach). But the role of the boys in blue – including some in the uppermost regions of Scotland Yard? There the Leveson Crystal Ball One misted over pretty swiftly. Crystal Ball Two, then, would surely have been about the links, the columns, the contracts – the merry-go-round that found Fleet Street and the Yard much too close for comfort. Thank heavens for officialdom’s wisdom in deeming that we’ve heard quite enough of such discomfiting stuff. Case closed."
2015-04-06T06:21:30Z,Reclaim Australia rallies 'hurtful' to new migrants and refugees,"Refugees and new migrants feel more isolated and vulnerable following last weekend’s Reclaim Australia rallies, community leaders said. The anti-Islam rallies on Saturday attracted hundreds of demonstrators nationwide who were protesting against halal certification, sharia law and increased Muslim migration. Counterprotests were held in several cities, in some cases eclipsing the original rallies. Edward Solo, vice president of the Federation of African Communities Councils in Australia, said the anti-Islam rallies are “hurtful”. “It is really a fearful message,” he said. Solo said many new arrivals will worry that they will be the next targets of the rallies. “It is hurtful to your efforts to rebuild your lives [which were] shattered back home,” he said. Kon Karapanagiotidis from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that the protests build on the anti-refugee sentiment that has been stirred up by the government’s hardline border protection policies. “This is a community that feels like it is under attack, a community that feels isolated and unwelcome,” he said. “Reclaim Australia makes asylum seekers feel more under threat.” Joe Caputo, chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Council of Australia, was wary of giving the protesters too much publicity, labelling them “a totally isolated fringe group that is insignificant”. He said demonstrators were “ignorant”, “misinformed” and “out of this world”, pointing to the fact that no mainstream organisations or politicians attended the rallies as evidence that they are in the minority. But chief executive of the Arab Council, Randa Kattan, warned that even small groups can be dangerous. “In terms of numbers they might be insignificant, but in terms of damage, it is significant,” she said. Kattan said it “only takes one incident” of racism or hatred to spark simmering tensions. The protesters are “squeaky wheels grabbing attention” in order to exploit existing divisions, she said. Solo dismissed protesters’ concerns that Australia would consider adopting sharia law, saying that “lacks serious grounds for action”. “Nothing of that nature can happen now ... or in the immediate future,” he said. Karapanagiotidis has criticised politicians from both sides for not speaking out against the Reclaim Australia rallies, drawing a contrast with German chancellor Angela Merkel who spoke out against ultra rightwing group Pegida by saying members had “hatred in their hearts”. He said the silence of politicians is “damning”, accusing them of exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment. Executive director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation, Hass Dellal, said that there is a “fear of the unknown” within the community, and that the rallies “shouldn’t be dismissed”. He said the best way to overcome that fear is via interfaith initiatives and through open engagement between diverse groups."
2015-11-11T13:16:08Z,US millionaire extends migrant rescue mission to Turkey and Greece,"An American millionaire has launched a private rescue mission in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to save the lives of a still-increasing number of refugees and migrants sailing from Turkey to Greece. The Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas), a charity founded and run by Chris Catrambone, an American entrepreneur, already runs a rescue mission off the coast of Libya, and will now operate a second boat in waters between the Turkish coastline and the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos. The ship’s two speedboats will be named after the two Syrian children, Aylan and Galip Kurdi, whose deaths in early September sparked international outrage. Several hundred thousand refugees, mainly Syrian and Afghan, have crossed this stretch of the Aegean Sea this year, and a rising number are now drowning due to the stormier weather conditions. A record 3,460 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far in 2015, roughly 450 of whom drowned in the Aegean, according to figures supplied by the UN refugee agency. Explaining the decision, the charity’s director, Martin Xuereb, said: “As long as people are crossing for one reason or other, there needs to be an asset there that mitigates loss of life at sea. We’re not saying that saving lives will solve the issue of migration, we know it’s much more complex than that. But we’re there to look after the individuals or groups who feel they have no other option to take to boats whether it’s the central Mediterranean [north of Libya], or the Aegean.” Moas’s decision to expand search-and-rescue operations comes on the day that EU leaders meet in Malta for the latest in a series of conferences about how to end migration to Europe. Xuereb said he hoped the existence of Moas, and the high level of donations it has received from the general public in recent months, will show European leaders there is a substantial level of public support for more humane responses to the crisis. “I think what we have done is show that there is a section of people who do not want to be bystanders and do not want people to drown at sea,” said Xuereb, the former commander-in-chief of the Maltese army. “I’m not just talking about Moas, but the thousands of people who have supported us.” Moas will also begin rescue missions off the coast of south-east Asia in the coming months. Doctors Without Borders also operates rescue missions in the southern Mediterranean."

So far Germany has put other nations to shame with plans to take 800,000 asylum seekers this year. There has also been a series of impressive voluntary campaigns and gestures, from Refugees Welcome – a scheme for sharing homes with those fleeing conflict and persecution described as ”an Airbnb for refugees” – to a professional football club fielding a third team made up entirely of refugees. By contrast the response of the British media has been characterised by fear rather than compassion, but there are plenty of ways that individuals can offer support. We want to hear about how you’ve helped those seeking asylum. But in the meantime, here’s a guide about some of the ways you can contribute. Give Money A number of charities and non-governmental organisations have opened appeals specifically aimed at helping the plight of refugees. Various organisations spell out exactly what a specific donation could provide. Here’s a sample: Migrant Offshore Aid Station: The charity which runs independent rescue boats to rescue migrants at risk of drowning has seen a huge spike in donations since pictures of the drowned Syrian boy emerged. Médecins Sans Frontières: The humanitarian agency has three rescue ships in the Mediterranean, on Tuesday alone they rescued 1,658 people in its biggest day of operations. Aylan Kurdi Fund: A specific fund named in honour of the drowned boy was set up within 24 hours of the circulation photographs of his body emerging. All proceeds will go to the humanitarian agency Hand in Hand for Syria. Refugee Council: A donation of £100 could pay for the education and travel for two children for a week. Unicef: The UN’s children’s charity is providing life-saving supplies such as clean water, medicine and psychological support. It says a donation of £9 could provide an emergency water kit for a family. Save the Children: It says a donation of £50 could buy two hygiene kits including soap, towels and toothbrushes. British Red Cross: A donation of £30 could buy 28 mats to help Syria refugees cope with the cold. Islamic Relief: Three families could be fed for a month on a donation of £210, the charity says. The crowdfunding website Just Giving has a list of specific appeals for migrants in Calais. It includes one of students trying to raise £750 to buy mobile phones, footballs, camping equipment, dictionaries, storage boxes, sanitary items and waterproof clothing. The UNHCR is running camps, providing shelter and aid to refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, as well as helping refugees across Europe. Other Donations It is not only cash that can help. Refugee Action is offering to take old cars as donations. It says the last scrap car it took raised £126 for refugees. It is also looking for old mobile phones and even printer cartridges. A Facebook group Music Against Borders is looking for musical instruments for migrant musicians in Calais. Teacher Mary Jones is looking for donations of books for her Jungle Books library named after the Calais migrant camp. The grass roots campaign Calais Action is urging supporters to donate in any way they can. It has put together a map of drop-off and collection zones. Volunteer The US refugee charity the International Rescue Committee has opportunities to volunteer at all of its 22 offices. Roles include mentoring refugee families and helping refugees find jobs. The organisation also asking for donations. Protest March on Downing Street in Solidarity with Refugees on Saturday 12 September. The protest begins at noon at London’s Marble Arch. The International Organisation for Migration is urging supporters to get involved in its #MigrantsContribute campaign, which promotes the cultural, economic, and political contributions that migrants make to society. A number of online petitions have been launched, including one calling for a more compassionate Europe-wide response to the crisis and another urging Britain to accept more asylum seekers. What are you doing to help?"
2015-11-27T10:00:04Z,Don't let the Paris climate talks ignore people displaced by global warming | Roberto Lovato,"We are all entering uncharted waters as the effects of climate change begin to create categories of migrants that have no precedent: migrants rendered stateless after their island nations disappear; migrants constituting a vast, roaming “environmental refugee” population; migrants fleeing climate-intensified wars and violence like that in Syria and Central America. In a matter of days, global leaders will enter the most delicate and potentially catastrophic discussions about civilization and migration in history. The UN COP21 conference on climate in Paris could decide the fate of people being displaced by climate change – the number of which has been forecast to be as many as 1 billion people, with 200 million being the most widely cited figure. In September New Zealand rejected Ioane Teitiota’s quest to become the world’s first officially recognized climate-change refugee, and deported him back to the island nation of Kiribati instead. Kiribati is so vulnerable to sea-level rise that its government recently purchased land in Fiji so that it would have a place to relocate its citizens when the islands are eventually submerged, a fate that now seems inevitable. Is this how the west will deal with climate-change refugees? COP21 should be addressing this very question yet, incredibly, the mention of the term migrants may be cut from the final agreement coming out of the critical global gathering. In October a revised draft of the conference agreement showed proposed deletions of any mention of “migrants” from the final conference agreement. Deleting just a over a dozen words will have many unfortunate consequences, including letting the countries of the global North off the hook for continuing with their current strategy. Instead of actually facing the crisis, the global North will just be policing migrants. Before the Paris attacks, the COP21 host country’s president, François Hollande, warned in a press conference in September that, without substantive climate action, “We won’t have hundreds of thousands of refugees in the next 20 or 30 years, but millions.” He also reminded the countries of the global North to fulfill their commitment, made during the 2009 Copenhagen (COP15) talks, to increase aid to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to $100bn a year by 2020. That was before France’s 9-11. Since then, serious talk about serious issues is being replaced by the dangerous and outmoded xenophobic talk that has been making a worldwide comeback in the wake of the Paris attacks. The calls by Marine Le Pen, France’s far-right National Front party leader, to “expel” all the “illegal migrants who have nothing to do here” were echoed throughout the United States, where all Republican presidential candidates sounded immigration alarms. Marco Rubio, for example, called the attacks on Paris part of a larger “clash of civilizations” and also called for the United States to immediately “halt new admissions of refugees from Syria”. This has devastating effects on migrants: painting them as threats, rather than people fleeing threats from civil war, the rising ocean or, as is increasingly the case, violence and conflict that scientists say has been worsened by the effects of climate change. This shift now provides Northern countries another way to mask their unwillingness to deal with the migration crisis that their production and consumption habits have played a role in creating. Yet it is likely that “the burden of providing for climate migrants will be borne by the poorest countries – those least responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases”, according to the International Organization for Migration. The COP21 talks should take a reality-based approach, beginning with actually mentioning the word migrants in the agreement that comes out of the talks, as earlier drafts did. Before the titanic waves of coming displacement, members should also reinstate the idea that Australia (the nation whose outspokenness against dealing with climate migration has it playing the role of Donald Trump on the world migration stage) worked to have stricken from the plan: establishing a “climate change displacement coordination facility” to help with both emergency relief and planned relocations. Also being discussed (at least by the most climate-vulnerable countries) are proposals to include language that opens the door to providing legal protection to climate refugees. These protections aren’t simply a moral imperative; they represent the only civilized approach to climate migration. This piece was published in coordination with Creative Time Reports."
2016-08-04T11:30:19Z,Costa Rica expects asylum claims to quadruple as refugees head south,"Asylum claims in Costa Rica are set to quadruple this year from 2014 as stricter controls in Mexico and the US force Central Americans fleeing violence and political instability to find new migration routes. Tens of thousands of Central Americans from the “Northern Triangle” countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have fled their homes in recent years to escape violent criminal gangs who regularly target civilians for murder, rape and extortion. While most of this migrant flow still heads north, some refugees have found homes elsewhere on the Central American isthmus. While Belize and Panama have also seen spikes in migration, Costa Rica, one of the most politically and economically stable countries in the region, has become an attractive alternative for Central American refugees. Now, the country is going one step further, following the announcement of a new scheme to offer temporary protection to refugees from the Northern Triangle. Under the new protection transfer agreement (PTA), Costa Rica will accept up to 200 prescreened refugees for periods of up to six months, while their US asylum applications are processed. Migrants who arrive in Costa Rica before applying will not be considered for US asylum. Though only a small number of migrants will benefit from the project, it marks a significant change in the international response to fleeing Central Americans, who were previously considered primarily as economic migrants, unqualified for refugee status. “It is a shift in the way both the US and the region are looking at the outflows from the Northern Triangle,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with Washington-based thinktank Migration Policy. “This is a recognition that people in the Northern Triangle are facing true refugee circumstances and can’t stay in their countries.” The PTA will be the first time in recent Latin American history that a third country will offer temporary protection to refugees. The United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration will assume all costs associated with the project, and if it is successful, organizers hope to broker similar agreements with other countries throughout the region. The announcement is also significant for Costa Rica, which along with managing the spike in asylum applications from the Northern Triangle has found itself at the center of two separate migrant crises, following a border crackdown by its northern neighbor, Nicaragua. After the closure stranded nearly 8,000 US-bound Cubans in the country late last year, the government housed them in shelters while it brokered an airlift with its regional allies. With Nicaragua now blocking the entry of more than 2,000 extra-continental migrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, Costa Rica has again promised the migrants safe passage and offered applications for asylum and spots in several shelters throughout the country. “We consider Costa Rica a champion in managing immigration and an example for the region,” said Carlos Maldonado, the UNHCR chief in Costa Rica. “Human rights has always been one of Costa Rica’s key trademarks and the country’s government, people and civil society have acted admirably when faced with these migrant flows,” he added. Though on its own the PTA will not be bringing Central American refugees to Costa Rica permanently, some experts believe that the agreement and the country’s other refugee-friendly policies could encourage more migrants to try moving south. “It is hard to imagine that the country accepting two hundred people for transfer would change the flow significantly,” Hipsman said, “but the fact that Costa Rica is publicly accepting refugees for processing could signal to would-be refugees or migrants that it might be a more welcoming place.”"
2016-11-16T17:50:38Z,"In one week, 240 feared drowned in Med","About 240 people are suspected to have drowned this week in four separate incidents in the Mediterranean, raising the total annual death toll to an unprecedented 4,500. Deaths in the Mediterranean are now nearly 20% higher than last year’s total of 3,771, which was the previous annual record. About 130 asylum seekers are missing after a rubber boat capsized on Sunday night, while another 100 are thought to have drowned on Tuesday night in a separate incident, the UN refugee agency said. Up to 10 people died in two further tragedies in recent days, bringing the death toll this week to at least 240. In the accident on Sunday 15 survivors were left in the water for 10 hours, clinging on to a piece of a capsized boat, before being rescued by an oil tanker. Nine are still in hospital, Iosto Ibba, a spokesman for UNHCR, said in a phone call. Migration between Turkey and Greece has lessened significantly since March, after Turkey agreed to re-admit people deported from Greece. But crossings between Libya and Italy continue unabated. More than 165,000 people have reached Italy so far this year from north Africa, and the final annual total is likely to surpass the previous record of 170,000. Ibba said the continuing migration flows, and rising death tolls, showed why Europe needed to provide asylum seekers with more legal routes to safety. “Without alternative ways to reach Europe, refugees will always try to reach safety in dangerous ways,” said Ibba. “That’s why it’s so important to expand legal pathways for refugees, including humanitarian admissions, family reunification programmes, private sponsorship, and student visas for refugees. At the same time it’s also important to support the countries of origin and transit, and to keep up search-and-rescue missions, without which the death toll would be even higher.” European countries are attempting to stem migration flows by providing more aid to African countries that agree to re-admit deported asylum seekers. Additionally, navies from countries such as Britain are intercepting and destroying Libyan smugglers’ repurposed fishing trawlers after they enter international waters. But that strategy has failed because smugglers have instead packed their customers into disposable rubber boats – which can be operated by the refugees themselves, allowing the smugglers to remain in Libya. The rising death toll in 2016 can be partly explained by the increasing use of the inflatable boats, which are even more dangerous than the wooden ships they replaced. Syrians are no longer using Libya as a springboard to reach Europe. Instead, Libya is mainly used by people fleeing war and poverty in Nigeria and Sudan, or repression in Eritrea and Gambia. Others are migrant workers who tried to find jobs in Libya, but fled after the civil war there led to the collapse of law and order. Many migrants are kept in slavery-like conditions by their Libyan employers, while others are tortured or extorted, sometimes by the authorities. About 70% say they faced some kind of exploitation in Libya, according to research by the International Organisation for Migration."
2016-09-17T20:07:01Z,"Migrant death toll expected to exceed 10,000 in 2016","The world is on course to register its highest number of migrant deaths this year, as criticism mounts over failing international efforts to cope with the global refugee crisis. Forecasts from analysts at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) indicate that the number of fatalities among refugees will pass the landmark figure of 10,000 in 2016. The dire statistic will cast a shadow over two high-profile summits on migration in New York this week: on Monday the UN general assembly will meet to discuss the record volume of individuals forced to flee their homes as a result of crises and war around the world. That number currently stands at 65 million people, including 21.3 million refugees who have been forced to flee their country. On Tuesday, US president Barack Obama will host a leaders’ summit – to be attended by the prime minister, Theresa May – intended to raise funds for refugee initiatives and expanded resettlement programmes. Julia Black, of the charity Missing Migrants Project at its data analysis centre in Berlin, said that the organisation was confident that the world was facing its highest-ever mortality migration rate. She told the Observer: “Last year we had more than 5,000 deaths across the world. This year we’re already at more than 4,000, but outside of the Mediterranean and Europe the information is so poor we really think it’s a gross underestimate. “This year we’ll reach that 5,000 total again realistically, but I would expect the real figure would be twice as much. The order of magnitude is greater than anything we’ve seen.” A huge proportion of migrant deaths occur from drownings during the hazardous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy. The latest figures show that 3,212 have died so far during 2016 making the journey. The IOM also said it had logged 400 deaths due to migration this year in Latin America. “But the number could easily be two or three times that figure,” said Black. On Saturday thousands of people marched through central London calling on the UK government to display stronger leadership in finding a humane international response to the refugee crisis and urging May to adopt a leading role at the New York meetings. On Saturday night Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, joined calls for May to provide more safe routes of passage to Britain in addition to increasing help for unaccompanied child refugees and accelerating plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians. “The decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging. Britain has always done its bit to help those fleeing persecution – we have to live up to those values again now,” said Cooper. The draft document for the UN summit has been heavily criticised by human rights groups who say it has effectively “sabotaged” its outcome by removing any proposals of substance. Critics also point to the UK government’s donor conference for Syria, held in London in February, which seven months on has yielded only one sixth of the £6bn pledged. On Friday, it emerged that fewer than 5,000 asylum seekers have been relocated from Greece and Italy to other European countries. Adopted one year ago, the EU relocation scheme was designed to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from frontline EU countries. New reports indicate that some Syrian refugees are opting to return home. Ghias Aljundi, a Syrian refugee and adviser to Amnesty International’s campaign on refugees, said that families stranded in Greek refugee camps were so fed up having to wait months in “dire” conditions they were choosing to return to Syria, where more than 470,000 have died in the civil war. “They want to go home to Syria. And we all know how bad the situation is there. One father said: ‘We have lost hope in Europe, we have lost trust in Europe,’” added Aljundi. The dangers faced by refugees will be highlighted in a series of reports unveiled this week. Among them one by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) which is expected to reveal that three-quarters of those who crossed via Libya experienced physical violence, and over a quarter detailed experiences relating to the death of fellow travellers."
2016-10-20T19:00:09Z,UK policy to deport refugees for 'extremist behaviour' criticised,"UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit “extremist behaviour” may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation’s general assembly is to be told. In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK’s record. Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the UN’s special rapporteur on “protecting human rights while countering terrorism” since 2011. “The link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,” he is due to tell the UN session on Friday. “There is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.” Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports. Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: “The United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values. “Legislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.” His reference is to a Home Office report, Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status, published earlier this year. It states: “Extremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].” It also notes that: “Although there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.” Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: “Almost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk – they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees. “Many states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees. “Among the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.” Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which “provides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece”. He said he was concerned about the “absence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey”. Emmerson’s report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees, which details his criticisms, is on the UN’s website."
2016-12-29T18:26:45Z,Britain’s responsibility for refugee children | Letters,"As Lord Dubs has himself reflected (A hostile Europe may turn its back on child refugees, says Labour peer, 29 December), he was just one of a handful of children who were able to gain access to the UK in the late 1930s. In common with, for example, the Oxford geochronologist Professor Stephen Moorbath and actor Andrew Sachs, both of whom have died in recent months, Alf Dubs has contributed hugely to the life and welfare of the UK and all those who made their way here in flight from murder by the Third Reich went on to establish personal, family and professional lives and, as a scientific colleague said at Stephen Moorbath’s funeral, have repaid their refuge in the UK many times over. Can it really be the case that 85,000 unaccompanied, traumatised and distressed children are going to be kicked from pillar to post, spurned, left to drift, vulnerable to sexual exploitation, childhoods for ever lost? The UK government has made a pathetic token gesture and allowed in a tiny number. Now the gates are bolted shut and gatekeeper May is devoid of compassion. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Joan Smith (We are failing to help a generation of traumatised children, 28 December) will be heartened to know that the welfare of traumatised refugee children is being addressed by a new charity in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The Kalimat Foundation, which takes its name from the Arabic for “words”, takes books into refugee camps and supports trained staff who use stories to help children understand what has happened to them. The charity, which was established earlier this year by Sheikha Bodour Al Qasimi, whose father is the ruler of Sharjah, believes stories can unlock feelings and aid the journey to recovery.

2016-11-03T00:01:33Z,"EU policy leading to abuse of migrants in Italy, claims Amnesty","European migration policies have led to the alleged torture, abuse and illegal deportation of asylum seekers arriving by boat to Italy, according to dozens of migrant testimonies published for the first time. Forty Sudanese migrants were also illegally deported to Sudan without recourse to proper asylum procedures, and at least one of them – a refugee from Darfur – was beaten by officials on his return, interviewees said. The alleged abuse is the natural outcome of the EU’s new migration strategy, according to Amnesty International, which conducted the research. The implementation of the EU ‘hotspot’ system, which forces all migrants to be fingerprinted on arrival in Italy, and the failure of the EU’s relocation scheme, which has meant more refugees are housed in Italy and Greece than most EU members, has stretched Italian resources and created a dynamic that encourages abuse, Amnesty said. One Sudanese victim told the Guardian: “I saw someone tortured with electricity – I saw it with my own eyes.” The 23-year-old, who also provided testimony to Amnesty, added: “He refused to give [the police his] fingerprints, and that’s why they did it. They used Tasers.” The Italian interior ministry did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Italian officials and politicians have previously warned that the country lacks the resources to care properly for so many asylum seekers, and needs more support from its European neighbours. Since 2015, European leaders have forced Italy to register all arrivals from Libya, effectively making Italy responsible for their care, without welcoming any themselves. Just 1,200 refugees have been formally relocated from Italy to other European countries out of the 40,000 whom EU members initially promised to absorb. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, threatened last week to veto the disbursement of EU funds to countries that failed to welcome refugees from Italy. “Italy cannot take another year like the one we’ve just had,” Renzi said. Amnesty’s lead researcher on the project, Matteo De Bellis, said: “The hotspot approach, designed in Brussels and executed in Italy, has increased, not decreased, the pressure on frontline states. It is resulting in appalling violations of the rights of desperately vulnerable people for which the Italian authorities bear a direct responsibility and Europe’s leaders a political one.” The vast majority of incoming migrants appear to have been treated in a humane manner by Italian police. The Italian navy and coastguard also play an instrumental role in the rescue of hundreds of thousands of stricken asylum seekers in the southern Mediterranean. But the testimonies released on Thursday reveal that several officials, under pressure to fingerprint uncooperative asylum seekers, and to stem migration numbers, have abused people and returned them to dangerous situations without allowing them to apply for asylum. One 27-year-old victim alleged that policemen in Sicily beat and Tasered him before using a pair of three-pronged pliers on his naked testicles. “I was on a chair made of aluminium, with an opening on the seat,” he told Amnesty, in testimony also confirmed by a second victim. “They held [my] shoulders and legs, took my testicles with the pliers, and pulled twice. I can’t say how painful it was.” A 16-year-old from Darfur told Amnesty that he was electrocuted after he tried to resist being fingerprinted. “They gave me electricity with a stick, many times on the left leg, then on right leg, chest and belly,” he was quoted as saying. “I was too weak, I couldn’t resist and at that point they took both my hands and put them on the machine.” A Darfurian man deported to Sudan in August told the Guardian he was expelled despite telling policemen that he wished to apply for asylum. “I told them I wanted political asylum in Italy,” he said by telephone. “But I’m not sure the translator translated this.” The dangers of his illegal deportation became apparent on his arrival in Sudan. At least one returnee was beaten by Sudanese security officials during his interrogation, the man said. “He was dragged on the floor, and hit with a chair. We were in the same room, and he was next to me. I don’t [know] why they did it.” The Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, has been charged by the international criminal court with three counts of genocide in Darfur. The Guardian has asked the Sudanese government for comment. Additional reporting: Eiad Abdullatif"
2016-03-11T18:19:55Z,Greece rules out using force against migrants and refugees,"The Greek government has announced it will have reception centres with a capacity to host 50,000 people ready next week as figures showed the number of refugees and migrants in the country has passed 42,000. The country’s leftist-led coalition, racing against the clock to deal with the massive influx, ruled out using force to relocate more than 12,000 men, women and children stranded in increasingly wretched conditions on the Greek-Macedonian border. Instead, it said it hoped the people who are trapped in a waterlogged camp where sanitation facilities have deteriorated and illness has become rife would understand that Europe’s Balkan corridor had been closed and choose to settle in organised shelters. “We have to persuade them [to move] and we can’t do that using teargas,” said the deputy public order minister, Nikos Toskas. “Half the people there are women and children.” Authorities handed out fliers urging refugees to leave the sprawling tent city that has sprung up around Idomeni because there “is no hope” they can continue their journey north into Europe following the decision of Macedonia and other Balkan states to seal the route. Earlier this week, more than 14,000 people – including a baby boy born in a mud-clad tent to a Syrian refugee on Sunday – were caught in limbo as a result of the border closures. With debt-stricken Greece being tested to its limits by the crisis, the European Union pledged to expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. Seen as the easiest gateway into the 28-member bloc, Greece has been on the frontline of the emergency since hundreds of thousands of people began seeking refuge on the continent after fleeing conflict and poverty in Syria and elsewhere. “We have a moral duty as Europeans to offer this help to refugees,” the EU’s leading humanitarian aid policy maker, Christos Stylianides, told reporters after holding talks in Athens with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. “I want to be clear: Greece is not alone in these difficult times.” Disaster relief of the sort normally distributed to developing nations has been earmarked for the myriad NGOs working out of the country under a €700m (£540m) EU aid programme announced last week. The package is due to be given the green light on Tuesday before being sent to the European parliament for further endorsement. “The humanitarian crisis that we currently have in Idomeni is not a Greek matter, it is a European matter and we should all face it together,” Tsipras said after the meeting. He said the overstretched state apparatus, which is preparing holding facilities for 10,000 people every week, should receive financial support. Despite the contours of an agreement being reached with Turkey at an emergency EU summit to stem the flows on Monday, increasing numbers of migrants and refugees are continuing to make the often perilous journey to Greece’s Aegean isles. By Friday, 42,253 were inside the country, according to Athens, including 864 who landed on Greek shores on Thursday and about 1,600 who reached the Aegean island of Chios on Wednesday. Announcing that the time had come to focus on the smuggling rings behind the illicit flows, the deputy defence minister Dimitris Vitsa, who is coordinating the Greek government’s response to the crisis, told Star TV: “We have to turn our eyes to traffickers [in Turkey] … because it is they who are selling false hope to people.”"
2016-12-15T12:47:48Z,EU claims of success in curbing Niger migrants greeted with scepticism,"The EU has hailed a plunge in the number of migrants crossing Niger to reach Europe as a success for its anti-trafficking strategy, even as MEPs complained that the bloc’s figures did not add up. The volume of migrants making the perilous journey across Niger’s desert fell from 70,000 in May to 1,500 in November, according to an EU statement released on Wednesday. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc’s funding of anti-migration measures in Africa was creating “positive results and important building blocks for new cooperation”. The Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipila, has called for the scheme to be extended to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. At an EU summit on Thursday, an announcement of thousands more “voluntary assisted returns” to Libya is expected. But doubts about the probity of the figures for Niger cast a shadow over Wednesday’s announcement. The declared drop in migrants crossing Niger is based on an assessment of just two monitoring points, and data that “does not reflect overall entries or exits to and from Niger”. That assessment – by the International Organisation for Migration – also suggests that migrants are avoiding key towns and transit points in Niger “for fear of repression”, casting further doubt on what EU officials had described as “a success story” for EU policy. The Green MEP Judith Sargentini branded the European commission’s claim to have reduced migrant numbers in Niger as being “at least questionable, if not harmful for migrants”. She said: “EU support for Niger’s border guards has made people smuggling even more profitable, as the prices of people smuggling rise due to increased border guards. Meanwhile, proposals for legal pathways for refugees and economic migrants are nowhere to be seen. In all aspects, this is a failing approach.” Many migrants are thought to have travelled north through Niger to Libya, from where human smugglers ferry them to Italy on ramshackle boats. Sargentini, a member of the European parliament’s development committee, pointed out that more people had died in the Mediterranean Sea this year than in 2015, and said that the EU’s pride at trends in Niger was misplaced. “If the EU really did reduce the number of people transiting through that country, where are those people now, and what state are they in?” she asked. Senior EU officials insist it is too early to conclude that traffickers have diverted their routes via neighbouring Mali to avoid detection by EU-trained border guards. But one said that the bloc was “starting to see circumstantial evidence” of this. By early next year, the EU wants to sign agreements linking aid to migration restrictions with five African countries – Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia. EU officials will then be deployed in these countries to help with measures such as the biometric registration of migrants passing through. In a progress report for Senegal, EU sources say “a lot of work has to be done on the root causes of migration”, although they are hopeful of progress in Nigeria, where the readmission of deported EU migrants began in October. In total, 4,430 people have been repatriated from Europe under the migration pacts so far, and a further 2,700 people have been returned to priority countries. However, Raphael Shilhav, Oxfam’s EU migration adviser, said the policy had been short-sighted in its depiction of migration as a negative phenomenon. “Migration is an important tool for development in western Africa and a vital coping mechanism for displaced peoples,” he said. “In the Lake Chad basin, we have millions of people displaced – including across borders – and an EU intervention to close down borders is problematic. These people need humanitarian assistance.” Many NGOs and MEPs complain that existing development aid pledges are being diverted towards projects aimed at stemming migration. There are no reliable figures for how much of the contribution that EU countries make to a €2.5bn Africa Trust fund linked to migration curbs comes from existing development aid budgets. “You can’t say that it is new [money],” said one EU official. “It may be additional funding that is being mobilised for this purpose.”"
2016-09-21T17:01:13Z,Where Theresa May’s stance on refugees takes us | Letters,"Theresa May posturing to the UN on uncontrolled migration (May refuses to take more Syrian refugees, 20 September) was a little bit like a serial adulterer giving a lecture on the merits of fidelity in marriage. I’m surprised she didn’t get bottled off stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8 million had fled Syria. More than that fled Afghanistan during the UK’s period of intervention. Surprisingly, dropping bombs upon people causes them to run away. Perhaps Mrs May should dwell upon that fact, rather than lecturing the UN about the differences between refugees and economic migrants. Paul Dodenhoff Leyland, Lancashire • The “polite and gentle” boy killed attempting to climb on to a lorry last Friday (Report, 20 September) could have been the child I met while volunteering in the Calais migrant camp last month. I was teaching English, as part of Care4Calais’s outreach scheme. He was small for his age and his eyes were red with tiredness and tear gas. He explained that each night he climbed trees in order to jump down on to the lorries. He would cut the tarpaulin in a vain attempt to evade the heat sensors and sniffer dogs. Each night he would be returned to the camp, often after a beating from the police. Walls and fences will not keep desperate people out (including unaccompanied children); surely we have a moral responsibility to at the very least let the children in. There must be no more deaths. Simon Shaw Vice president, Redbridge Teachers’ Association • Patrick Kingsley (Opinion, 20 September) knows more than most what Theresa May’s asylum/refugee policies are all about: keep them out. This guided her through her Home Office days. She could reflect on what is happening in Canada, where Justin Trudeau’s government has settled 30,000 Syrians, mostly families, mostly welcomed and sponsored by Canadian families. In the UK many people have offered to do the same, but Mrs May won’t allow this to happen, even when people have offered full housing and financial support. Doesn’t matter what is happening in Syria or elsewhere – “keep them out and leave it to others” is the voice inside Mrs May’s head, a voice not susceptible to humanitarian considerations. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • The real challenge facing world leaders attending President Obama’s summit on refugees (Report, 19 September) is tackling the root causes of migration, not just the effects. By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking plaster rather than a cure. Even more concerning is the UK’s involvement in the so-called Khartoum process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan’s refugees from reaching Libya and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan’s record of ethnically cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek sanctuary – and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan’s government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, they would be more likely to stay there. By too often appeasing Sudan’s leaders, we have guaranteed that thousands of Sudanese will continue to seek refuge with their former colonial rulers. Olivia Warham Director, Waging Peace"
2016-11-28T12:27:22Z,2016 sets new record for asylum seekers reaching Italy by boat,"More asylum seekers have now reached Italy by boat in 2016 than in any previous year on record. Nearly 171,000 people have arrived in Italy from north Africa since the start of the year, according to statistics compiled by the UN refugee agency and the Italian government. As of Monday, the total had surpassed the previous record of 170,000, set in 2014. Migration flows in the eastern Mediterranean between Turkey and Greece have been drastically reduced after improvements in Turkish policing, increased threats of deportation from Greece, and the closure of a humanitarian corridor between Greece and Germany. But Europe’s deterrent strategy has failed to cut migration in the central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy, with the Italian route once again becoming the main migrant gateway into Europe. European navies, including Britain’s, have focused on a military-style response, sending frigates to arrest smugglers in international waters. Libyan smugglers have responded by sending passengers on board inflatable dinghies that are piloted by migrants themselves, reducing smugglers’ exposure to arrest and allowing their business to continue as normal. The Libyan civil war has weakened the country’s law enforcement agencies, some of whom are complicit in the smuggling, leaving European governments without viable Libyan partners in their fight against migration. The chaos there also gives migrants more incentive to leave for Europe; in previous years they could more easily find work and stability in Libya. Pressure on transit countries in the Sahara desert, through which many African migrants pass before reaching Libya, has had no effect. Flows through Niger, the country to Libya’s south, increased in 2016, despite Niger introducing new anti-smuggling laws at the request of the EU. Displacement in north-east Nigeria, where 1.4 million people have been forced to flee Boko Haram, may contribute to sustained levels of migration towards Europe in the future. The numbers coming to Europe are nevertheless insignificant compared with flows within Africa itself. Just 3.3% of the world’s displaced Africans have reached Europe. More than 93% remain within their home continent. The majority of migrants bound for Italy are fleeing poverty, wars and dictatorships in Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan and the Gambia. Syrians no longer use the Libyan route. The breakdown of law and order has significantly worsened living conditions for foreign workers in Libya since 2011. Many report conditions tantamount to slave labour, while hundreds have been kidnapped for ransom, and sometimes tortured. A recent survey of new arrivals in Italy by the International Organisation for Migration found that 70% of respondents had been exploited to some degree during their journey to Europe. Other recent IOM research shows that the majority had not intended to travel to Europe when leaving home, but had been forced to change their destinations due to extenuating circumstances such as the Libyan civil war."
2016-12-09T12:21:28Z,Please help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal,"The plight of child refugees is at the heart of this year’s Guardian and Observer charity appeal. We supported refugees last year and we are proud to return to this theme again. It remains the great humanitarian crisis of our times. The political mood has hardened around immigration, and in a volatile world the tragedy of forced migration can seem less visible. Yet the reality is inescapable: in Europe, thousands of children are stuck in squalid camps or sleeping rough, caught up in political turmoil beyond their control and exposed to multiple dangers. This year, record numbers of children have drowned in the Mediterranean; others have been placed in detention for travelling without documents. Official figures indicate more than 90,000 children have travelled alone, fleeing war and destitution across Europe. Charities believe the real figure is higher, because so many have slipped beneath the radar. The Guardian and Observer have consistently reported the dire conditions faced by many children: the rat-infested camps, the unheated squats and the muddy ditches that they are forced to call home. We’ve published interviews with children of primary school age, travelling without parents, worried about how to feed themselves and how to get to safety. Child refugees running from war and violent unrest in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan have told us Europe can seem an unwelcoming place. Many are shocked to find themselves living in camps that may be safe from bombs, but where conditions are far worse than what they were used to at home. Most despair at being stuck in limbo, unable to continue their education, wasting their lives. They risk disease, trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. Let’s be clear: without help, some will not survive the winter. The UK government’s response has been muted. It has resisted efforts to allow child refugees to be reunited with families in the UK, and delayed attempts to give shelter to the most vulnerable children travelling alone. The major aid agencies are clear that the UK has not accepted its fair share. The issue provokes both weariness and hostility from many in Britain; some find it convenient to conflate asylum seekers with economic migrants, and adopt a less than welcoming approach. Child refugees have been criticised for not looking sufficiently young. Our view has not changed from last year. The political solutions to the refugee crisis may be complex, but that does not mean we should abandon our humanity. We should not close our hearts, retreat behind walls, real or imagined, or ignore the pressing moral imperative to provide assistance and sanctuary for some of the world’s most desperate people. Guardian and Observer readers last year demonstrated extraordinary solidarity with refugees. Through our 2015 appeal you showed in your thousands that a more compassionate voice exists amid the rancour. You signalled a wish for a more tolerant, empathetic, kinder society. Above all, you showed amazing generosity: last year’s appeal raised an astonishing £2.6m for refugee charities. This year we are asking readers to donate to three fantastic charities that offer practical and effective help and support to child refugees, whether they are travelling alone or with families, or have already arrived in the UK. All combine a passionate entrepreneurialism with a dynamic commitment to social justice. Help Refugees brings a refreshing vitality and energy to the provision of emergency humanitarian aid. Set up just 16 months ago by a group of friends wondering what they could do to help refugees, it has grown to become one of Europe’s largest distributors of food, clothes, shelter and medicine to refugees, supporting over 50 projects across the continent. Safe Passage is another new project, created by the Citizens UK charity last year to help provide legal support to hundreds of unaccompanied refugee children, so that they can apply for asylum in the UK – many of them to be reunited with family members resident here – rather than risking their lives smuggling themselves in on lorries. Once refugee children are in the UK, adapting to their new surroundings can be a lonely and demoralising experience. A series of projects run by The Children’s Society provide a range of services from legal advice to help youngsters access education and housing, to language lessons, social activities and mentoring. The aim is to help youngsters overcome the trauma of migration, and to support them to rebuild their lives. Guardian and Observer journalists will over the next few weeks highlight the vital work of our three charities through words, pictures, and film, both online and in our newspapers. We have been inspired by them and their work, and we hope you will be too. Help us once again to show solidarity with refugees. Please give generously. • Support the three chosen charities by donating here"
2016-10-23T05:00:36Z,Why is it vulgar to speak up for migrants?,"In London an exhibition has just opened at the Barbican called The Vulgar. It is a fashion exhibition, with clothes that are often funny, but spotlit on mannequins so nobody laughs. There’s a Hussein Chalayan dress covered in false nails, a Courrèges minidress and 18th-century gowns the width of a studio flat. There are gold things. There are fans, which became vulgar when they were mass-produced. There are neo-classical dresses, vulgar because they are copies. Accompanying the fashions are definitions of the word by psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, which inspire the titles of each room: “Showing Off,” “Puritan,” “Extreme Bodies,” “Too Popular,” and “Common”. I sat with a cup of tea afterwards with one eye on Twitter. Lily Allen had been to the Jungle camp in Calais with the BBC and met a 13-year-old boy from Afghanistan. She broke down as she explained to him: “At three different intervals… the English in particular have put you in danger… We’ve bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I’m sorry for what we have put you through.” On Twitter she was dismissed as “pampered, coiffured and irrelevant”, urged to “speak for herself, not the nation – she represents nobody”, and received multiple warnings of rape, both for her and her daughters. The Sun said hers were “crocodile tears”, writing: “Before Lily starts ‘apologising’ for Brit troops taking on the Taliban, perhaps she should say sorry for her own mistakes. Two years ago her appalling single ‘URL Badman’ tanked at No 93. Earlier this year the attention-seeking mum passed out after a bender at the Notting Hill Carnival.” Jan Moir dedicated her Daily Mail column to Allen: “Just another indulged idiot who fondly imagines herself to be a daring and provocative political voice… Darling Lily got a fabulous manicure, put on an ever-so-serious, no-make-up face and took a camera crew with her to visit the Jungle. (There ain’t much in the way of practical work a gal can do with those nails, but never mind.) It looked quite good when Lily was filmed ladling out the soup for five minutes,” she said, adding: “The 31-year-old mother of two started crying, which must have been very confusing for the little boy, not to mention scary – but at least she didn’t sing.” As I read the criticism, one of Phillips’s definitions flashed to mind. Vulgar: “Impossible ambition: the arrivistes, the nouveau riche, the immigrants, the upwardly mobile.” People trying to be something they are not. People, like Allen, who should know their place. People trespassing on politics, on grown-up issues. She’s not even a good mother so why should we take her seriously? She doesn’t even have the right NAILS. How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for. Once the concept of vulgarity is in your head it’s hard to shake it out – you recognise it in debates about Brexit, anti-semitism, homophobia. You start questioning why people like Jan Moir and the furious Tweeters find Allen’s visit to Calais so threatening. Like a pensioner wearing a Topshop catsuit, Allen is parading her inappropriate views and emotions in full view of a crowd. She is getting above her station and needs to be knocked back. It’s not simply about her celebrity – I can’t remember a single furious column when Jude Law visited Calais, or Benedict Cumberbatch spoke of the “utter disgrace of the British government” for not doing enough. But their visits weren’t “vulgar” – there is nothing that disorients us about well-educated men speaking passionately. That’s how the world is meant to sound, regardless of what they’re saying. In the shadow of the exhibition, the whole episode made me feel sorry for those rising up to chastise Allen. If her tears and nails and apology require such scorn, doesn’t it suggest a degree of desperation and fear in the scornful? After spending time with those clothes, those images, the 19th-century etiquette manuals and Elizabethan document “enforcing the status of apparel” on materials that were restricted according to class, I sense an ancient anxiety that the barriers these judgers rely on for structure might be disappearing. The risk being then, that their houses would simply crumble. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"
2016-11-23T10:21:27Z,Seven 'migrants' rescued in boat in Folkestone harbour,"Seven people, thought to be migrants, were rescued in a boat in Folkestone harbour in the early hours of Wednesday morning after at least three began suffering from hypothermia. The small boat they were sailing in was found in the harbour after a distress call was made while it was out at sea. It is believed the boat reached the shore without assistance. Kent police said they were called to the scene just after 5.30am because of concerns about the boat. They said: “The Coastguard coordinated a search for the boat which was located at Folkestone harbour and seven suspected migrants were also found.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a search-and-rescue operation had been launched after a call was received from a boat reporting that people on board were unwell. A spokesman said: “A boat with seven people on board, including three with suspected hypothermia, was then found.” The recovered boat was a small red and black rib (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) with an outboard motor, according to the BBC reporter Simon Jones. The South East Coast ambulance service was also called. “The matter has been passed to Home Office immigration enforcement,” the statement from Kent police added. The Home Office has yet to comment. Speaking to Kent Online, a spokesman for the Kent coastguard said: “There are seven people, possibly immigrants, all males. One was on shore, the others were in a boat. We are now trying to find out where they originated from.” Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, said the incident highlighted the need to protect UK borders following the closure of the Calais refugee camp. He said: “This is yet another sign of the extreme lengths people will go to, risking their lives trying to break into Britain. Crossing the English Channel in a small boat as winter sets in is about as dangerous as it gets. “It’s clear that although the camp at Calais has been cleared, we now need to be more vigilant than ever. This incident underlines the need to ensure we scan our seas for people smugglers, protect our borders and to strengthen our intelligence effort with France.”"
2016-09-18T23:01:30Z,Theresa May to warn  UN of dangers of uncontrolled mass migration,"Theresa May is to tell the UN general assembly of the dangers of “uncontrolled mass migration” as it meets in New York to discuss how to help more than 21 million refugees around the world. The prime minister will call for a different global approach to migration aimed at “reducing today’s unmanaged population movement” as world leaders gather for the general assembly and a separate summit hosted by Barack Obama. At the UN, May will argue that it is not in the interests of the migrants to be exposed to exploitation and danger as they cross borders, nor the interests of the countries they are leaving, travelling through or seeking to reach. She will say that mass population movements reduce resources and popular support for refugees. Her arguments appear to echo those made by David Cameron’s government, which targeted most of its aid to refugees in countries bordering war zones, in contrast to Germany’s approach of accepting hundreds of thousands of people who had journeyed across Europe. It does, however, leave the door open for the UK to accept more refugees straight from camps, who have not embarked on journeys across seas and borders. May will propose three measures: helping refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants; and the right of all countries to control their borders, along with a responsibility to stop uncontrolled migration flows. Speaking before the general assembly, May said: “We cannot simply focus on treating the symptoms of this crisis, we need to address its root causes too.” The gathering comes as May faces criticism in the UK for failing to do enough to help refugees and demands to improve the UK’s pledge to settle 20,000 people from Syria over four years. Last week, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of 200 religious leaders to call for more action, criticising the government’s response as “too slow, too low and too narrow”. David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK will resettle more refugees. “Frankly, the UK should be saying we’ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year, so four times the current level, 25 refugees per parliamentary constituency rather than just six, because countries like Canada are already doing that,” he said. “So I think the UK could do more on the refugee resettlement side to match the frankly exemplary performance that the UK has on international humanitarian aid.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, called on May to speed up the government’s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians – setting a 2018 target rather than 2020 – and offer more help to those fleeing the war. She urged the prime minister to resettle 500 unaccompanied child refugees from the Calais camp and ensure that none were left by Christmas. “The prime minister must show leadership on the refugee crisis,” Cooper said. “She must go to this summit to galvanise international support for refugees and show that Britain can and will meet our commitments. Right now, the decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging.” The UN summit on refugees and migrants comes as the outgoing secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Obama attempt to use their remaining time in office to try to make some headway on issue. The UK government has said it will support the New York declaration on refugees and migrants due to be adopted at the UN, which reaffirms humanitarian principles but has been criticised by campaign groups for lacking teeth. Human Rights Watch called the draft of the final document “a missed opportunity” and Amnesty International accused member states of stripping away any proposals of substance. On Tuesday, Obama will host a separate leaders’ summit which will attempt to raise money and secure concrete pledges from countries to accept higher numbers of refugees for resettlement. May is expected to announce additional humanitarian support for refugees from the government’s ring-fenced aid budget later this week, and further action to provide services and create jobs in host countries."
2016-09-19T11:54:15Z,Theresa May's quasi-Darwinian fight to dilute right to claim asylum,"Theresa May will use her first speech to the United Nations to argue that the world’s wealthiest countries should offer only minimum protection to all but the most vulnerable of the world’s refugees. It will mark the start of her international campaign to dilute the right to claim asylum and to ensure – by enshrining the principle that claims for asylum should be made in the first safe country – that more than 86% of the world’s refugees are looked after by the poorest and middle-income countries. For make no mistake, when May talks of agreeing “a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants” she is talking about limiting the right of asylum seekers to reach Europe to have their claims for refugee status properly considered. When she also proposes that countries must “take responsibility to stop uncontrolled migrant flows” she is willing the means to ensure that happens. We know this because the UN’s speech is not a one-off. Indeed May showcased her strategy for dealing with the worst refugee crisis since the second world war in her Conservative party conference speech as home secretary last October. Then she made clear that she wanted to limit the number of asylum seekers who made it to Britain to claim refugee status by branding those who had made it across the Mediterranean to Calais or Britain as the “wealthiest, fittest and strongest” with the quasi-Darwinian implication that they are in some way undeserving queue-jumpers. She said more than 290,000 Syrians had claimed asylum across Europe at that point, and contrasted them sharply with the plight of the “most vulnerable” refugees in the Middle East camps. May boasted of Britain’s decision to take 20,000 of those most vulnerable refugees and promised she would “not in a thousand years” take part in any Europe-wide refugee responsibility-sharing programme. Instead May asserted last October that she wanted Britain to unilaterally enforce the “first safe country” rule by breaking the link between being recognised as a refugee and getting the right to settle in Britain. “If you’ve spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere – but we cannot return you to that safe country and you still need refuge – you’ll get the minimum stay of protection and you won’t have an automatic right to settle here,” she warned, adding that when that came to an end they would be returned as soon as a case review deemed it safe for them to do so. This lesser form of refugee status will also apply to those who successfully claim asylum after overstaying a British visa. She also launched her campaign for a review of the international legal definitions of who can qualify as a refugee or be rejected as an economic migrant to chip away at the 1951 Geneva convention definitions of those who should not be returned to countries where they face serious threats to their lives or freedom. This was not just party conference rhetoric. Home Office ministers confirmed in February that work was under way on a strategy to cut the numbers claiming asylum in Britain and to provide temporary protection to all but the “most deserving” refugees. There is a new twist. In her final months as home secretary, May was considering introducing a policy that a greater number of the most vulnerable refugees would be resettled in Britain only if it matched a reduction in those claiming asylum after reaching Britain under their own steam. Today’s UN summit on refugees and migrants will see many developing countries arguing for a major expansion in legal routes such as resettlement programmes, so that the wealthiest countries share some of the responsibility for the greatest refugee crisis since the second world war. They are hoping the UN special assembly will prove a watershed moment in the world’s response. Instead of rising to the challenge, the British prime minister will be blocking people’s escape routes and leaving the world’s poorest countries to cope with the crisis."
2016-12-20T18:00:07Z,The child refugees of Calais: ‘The journey is not yet over’,"Of all the children stuck in the Calais camp, 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) was one of the best able to articulate the horror of his situation, living in a tent for months, with no adult to care for him. I met him in August and was impressed by his elegant English, which he had learned from his father, a Nato translator who was targeted by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who had been forced to flee the country separately. Jawaad had no idea where his father was, and had travelled from Afghanistan to France alone. He was finding the conditions in Calais hard to bear. “Every second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police are familiar with beating. They don’t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog’s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails,” he told me, in the tarpaulin shack known as the Kids’ Cafe. When the camp in Calais was demolished, he was one of 1,700 young people put on buses to youth hostels and former old people’s homes and given temporary accommodation while their applications for asylum in the UK were processed. When we spoke by phone in mid-November, he was in a hostel in Talence, Bordeaux. He said he was relieved to be somewhere warm, where he could have a shower, but he hated the feeling of being in limbo. He said the interviewing process by Home Office officials who were assessing his application to join his cousins and uncle in Southampton was “disorganised”. He complained that because none of the boys spoke French and the staff did not speak English, they were communicating through Google Translate on phones. “People feel unhappy and angry,” he said. We know that he travelled to the UK at the end of November, one of 750 unaccompanied refugee children. He is in care while officials consider his application, but beyond that there are very few details of his current existence. He is no longer in touch with Mary Jones, who helped run the Kids’ Cafe. Once the children are taken into care in the UK, they often fall out of contact; usually they are encouraged by their foster parents to cut ties, to avoid any risk that they could be targeted by people smugglers, who may be anxious to have travel debts repaid. Jawaad “is one of the lucky ones”, says Jones, “if you can call a child lucky when he has no idea where his parents are, just that his father is in hiding from the Taliban and his mother had to flee their village when it was overrun by fighters from Daesh”. At least we know now that he is safe, able to study and work towards his ambition of becoming a doctor. Volunteers who worked with the Calais refugee children are more worried about those who remain in France, waiting for a decision on their future. Some have gone on hunger strike. The Home Office announced earlier this month that it has ended the emergency transfer programme to the UK, which means that up to a thousand more Calais children are still waiting. Jones is very worried about reports that several children have left the hostels and are sleeping rough again. “The journey is not yet over for [Jawaad], but hopefully it will just be a matter of weeks before he can get on with his life. For his friends and other refugee children left in France, most of them have given up hope and several have attempted suicide. It is only a matter of time before they go back to Calais and put their faith in smugglers again.” Donate to our refugee appeal at guardian.charitiestrust.org"
2017-12-01T19:03:31Z,"The Guardian view on refugees and migrants: solidarity, not fear | Editorial","The scale of the global humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding since the Arab spring precipitated revolt and instability across the Middle East in 2011 can feel overwhelming. In the past few weeks alone, terrible stories have emerged of the brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, forced to flee Myanmar to grim camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. A fortnight ago, CNN ran a devastating film shot undercover in Libya, showing young migrants from Nigeria being auctioned into slavery. The sight and sound of a market in human beings carries a weight that dwarfs other reporters’ graphic accounts of the scale of the trade. The impact of the CNN report drew unflattering attention to the EU-backed programme run by Libya to detain and repatriate migrants in order to prevent them attempting the Mediterranean crossing into Italy or Spain. This is an arrangement of convenience for Europe. It has led to migrants being held in wretched and degrading conditions that in an unusual rebuke of the countries that pay a significant part of the costs, were condemned by the UN as “inhuman”. This week the EU met with members of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The EU has now signed up to a programme to repatriate migrants rather than leaving the huge task to a country that is still in turmoil after the fall of Gaddafi, which was backed by the UK, France and the US. The great majority of the world’s displaced people flee to the nearest safe place, often another poor or middle-income country: in the past year a million refugees have arrived in Uganda from South Sudan. By far the largest part of the responsibility for those displaced around the Middle East has been borne by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Europe has been reluctant and defensive in responding to a crisis for which it is at least partly to blame. There has been a complete failure to agree a fair process for resettlement of refugees across the 28 member states. Greece and Italy have been left, for years now, to manage an unprecedented influx of desperate men, women and children. In an unparalleled international political vacuum, there has been little global leadership. Last year, the New York declaration on refugees and migrants tried to lay the framework for a positive approach. It starts with recognising realities: the forces that motivate young people to risk death in the hope of a better life need to be met not by the kind of resistance that ends up with thousands being penned up in a filthy Libyan detention centre, but by opening up legal channels of migration. Migrants want to work, and they want to be able to send cash home. Remittances are worth many billions of dollars to the economies of the global south; they cannot replace development aid, but they far outstrip its value. This time next year a UN refugee summit in Morocco aims to have a programme for legal migration in place. A humane policy for migrants would make it easier to distinguish and meet our obligations to refugees, those who flee in fear. The responsibility for displaced people has fallen on poorer countries in a grossly disproportionate way. At the very least, there should be a programme of education so that every child in every camp has a school place. Internally displaced people need to be helped to find work (not always easy) and supported with direct cash payments that will go back into the local economy. But all of this depends on changing attitudes, above all moving away from the language of threat. Many people in the rich world want to – and do – support refugees, often in a more personal way than giving money: Canada’s scheme, for example, of finding sponsors for 15,000 Syrian refugees was hugely oversubscribed. Fear often speaks with a powerful voice. But so can that other great human emotion, solidarity. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has called this crisis a test of humanity. It is one that we must not fail."
2017-12-12T00:01:18Z,"EU leaders complicit in torture of refugees and migrants, Amnesty says","European leaders stand accused by Amnesty International of being knowingly complicit in the torture and exploitation of thousands of migrants and refugees by the EU-financed Libyan coastguard and officials running the country’s detention camps. In an attempt to stem the flow of people across the Mediterranean to Europe, the EU is financing a system that routinely acts in collusion with militia groups and people traffickers to “make money from human suffering”, a report from the human rights group claims. Following the provision of ships, training and funding from the EU and Italy to the Libyan coastguard, the number of arrivals to Italy fell by 67% between July and November compared with the same period in 2016. Deaths at sea have been reduced commensurately. Yet Amnesty claims the coastguard and those to whom they hand over refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, are often acting in cahoots with criminal gangs and militia. Agreements between the coastguard and smugglers are signalled by markings on boats that allow specific vessels to pass through Libyan waters without interception, it is claimed. The coastguard has also been known to escort boats out to international waters. Those are who are intercepted on their way to Europe are sent to camps run by the Libyan general directorate for combating illegal migration (DCIM), where torture for the purposes of extracting money is almost routine, Amnesty reports. One man from Gambia, who was detained for three months, told Amnesty how he was starved and beaten in a detention centre. “They beat me with a rubber hose because they want money to release me,” he said. “They call the family while beating [you] so the family send money.” After interviews with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants and meetings with Libyan officials and others with knowledge of the abuses, Amnesty claims it now has sufficient evidence to take leaders of EU states to international courts over alleged abuses of human right obligations. “You will see us in court,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty’s Europe director. “Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in Libya are at the mercy of the Libyan authorities, militias, armed groups and smugglers often working seamlessly together for financial gain. Tens of thousands are kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centres where they are subjected to systematic abuse. “European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes.” Up to 20,000 people are currently held in what the Amnesty report, Libya’s Dark Web of Collusion, says are overcrowded, unsanitary centres, often under the control of militia and criminals. “For some time there has been concern that the price for stemming migration has been the human rights of those seeking to come to the EU,” the report says. Last month the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the abuse of migrants as “a crime against humanity” and said the EU and the African Union would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks”. In March, a review by the UK Independent Commission for Aid Impact said the UK role in the capacity-building programme with the Libyan coastguard was “deliver[ing] migrants back to a system that leads to indiscriminate and indefinite detention and denies refugees their right to asylum”. The UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, has described the suffering of migrants in Libyan camps as an “outrage to the conscience of humanity”. It is claimed by Amnesty that the EU member states “cannot plausibly claim to be unaware of the grave violations being committed by some of the detention officials and coastguard agents with whom they are so assiduously cooperating”. Brussels stands accused of failing to install the necessary rights protection mechanisms and guarantees from its Libyan counterparts. The reports says: “The lack of any judicial oversight of the detention process and the near total impunity with which officials operate has facilitated the institutionalisation of torture and other ill-treatment in detention centres.” Last month Mohamed Alkoni, the Libyan charge d’affaires, said any proven allegationof slavery was “an act of an individual, and not a systematic practice”."
2017-12-04T18:49:12Z,Pope shines as Trump fails test of leadership on migrants and refugees | Letter,"Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the UN global compacts on migration and refugees (Report, 4 December) is the latest example of the president’s abdication of leadership on a defining issue of our time. It is to be hoped that other leaders respond by redoubling efforts, as they did when Mr Trump announced the US’s abandonment of the Paris agreement. The international community should look to another head of state, Pope Francis, for an example of true leadership. He has made clear that the unprecedented movement of people worldwide constitutes a global phenomenon. As such, it requires a global response, not the renunciation of responsibility. This message will be echoed in the Holy See’s contribution to discussions taking place this week in Mexico. The pope has called our response to the plight faced by displaced people “a test of our humanity”. It is a test other leaders must not fail.

2017-08-11T15:22:42Z,Refugee rescue ship sails to aid of anti-migrant activists stranded in Med,"An NGO vessel that has saved the lives of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean is sailing to the rescue of a group of far-right anti-immigration activists whose ship is in difficulties off the coast of Libya. The German NGO Sea Eye said one of its search and rescue boats was on its way to the C-Star, manned by members of the extremist Generation Identity group, which sent a distress signal after an engine failure left it unable to manoeuvre. Michael Busch Heuer, the founder of the Regensburg-based aid organisation, which operates two rescue vessels active in the Mediterranean since early 2016, said it was the duty of anyone at sea “to help those in distress, irrespective of their origin, colour, religion or beliefs”. Sea Eye said in a statement on its Facebook page that it had been informed on Friday morning by Operation Sophia, the joint EU naval operation deterring migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the Mediterranean, that the 40-metre (130ft) C-Star was in difficulty. “Since our vessel the Sea Eye is closest to the C-Star, we were instructed by the maritime rescue coordination centre in Rome, the emergency service for the western Mediterranean, to go to its aid,” the NGO said. Generation Identity’s self-styled “Defend Europe” mission played down the incident, calling it a “minor technical problem” that meant the vessel was “not under command”. Defend Europe chartered the C-Star in Djibouti last month after raising €75,000 (£67,000) through crowdfunding. After originally promising to actively block migrant boats, it now says it is “monitoring” rescues in the Mediterranean. The group – part of a five-year-old movement of young, far-right activists from France, Germany, Austria, Italy and the UK who are opposed to Islam and immigration – accuses NGOs that have rescued about one third of the nearly 100,000 people saved in the Mediterranean this year of illegally working with people smugglers to bring migrants to Europe. Katie Hopkins, the MailOnline columnist, met members of the group in Catania, Sicily, tweeting: “Good to meet Team C-Star @DefendEuropeID. Young people, eight nations, crowdfunded, shining a light on NGO people traffickers in Med.” But the Defend Europe venture has not been an unmitigated success. First, the C-Star was held up for a week in the Suez canal by Egyptian authorities looking for weapons. Then some of its Sri Lankan crew jumped ship when it docked in the Cypriot port of Famagusta last month; several reportedly asked for asylum. The ship’s crew and owner, Sven Tomas Egerstrom, were accused in court of preparing and circulating false documents but later released. After leaving Cyprus on 1 August and being advised not to dock in Greece or Sicily for fear of protests, the vessel, which flies the Mongolian flag, was prevented by Tunisian fishermen from putting into the port of Zarzis for supplies. “If they come here, we’ll block the refuelling channel,” said Chamseddine Bourassine, a local fishermen’s leader. “It is the least we can do given what is happening out in the Mediterranean. Muslims and Africans are dying.” The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, a local NGO, said it would oppose any attempt by the C-Star to dock and take on fresh supplies of fuel, food and water in a Tunisian port. It called on the government “not to cooperate with its racist and dangerous crew”."
2017-12-14T13:00:44Z,Stranded migrants rescued from rocks off Turkey in dramatic operation,"The Turkish coastguard has mounted a dramatic rescue operation in the Aegean Sea, saving 51 people who became stranded on rocks as they attempted to cross to Greece. Authorities intervened after receiving an emergency call at 1.12am local time. The coastguard said the rescue operation could only begin in daylight due to the rocky area and bad sea conditions. Helicopters dropped food and blankets in the night. Footage from the rescue operation near the coastal city of İzmir showed coastguard personnel airlifting a child as others waited on the rocks next to a partially deflated rubber dinghy. Five children and a woman were rescued in this way while the rest were transferred to coastguard boats with the assistance of fishermen in the area, the coastguard said. There was no information on the migrants’ nationalities, but Turkey is home to 3 million refugees from Syria, and many have continued to attempt the risky boat ride across the sea to Greece despite a deal between Ankara and the European Union that has curtailed illegal crossings. While some still attempt the sea route, others try to cross into Greece through the land border, and are sometimes forcibly returned even after entering the Greek mainland. In addition to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, economic migrants from Asia and north Africa also attempt the crossing. More than 800,000 people reached Greece from Turkey at the height of the crisis in 2015, most of them settling in Germany and Sweden. The March 2016 EU deal, under which Turkey cracked down on illegal migration in exchange for an assistance package and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens, has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups, who say Europe has shirked its responsibility to process asylum requests. Since the deal, Turkey says the number of people detained while making the illegal crossing has fallen by 85%. Thousands of refugees and migrants are stranded in camps in Greece as the country attempts to deal with a backlog of asylum requests, and the influx has empowered far right and anti-immigrant parties across Europe. A relocation scheme introduced by the EU in 2015 in an attempt to share the burden of migrant arrivals has been vilified by nationalist governments. Earlier this week the Guardian reported how Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was ready to abandon the policy, which is being discussed by EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. On the ground, the suffering continues. A report by 12 humanitarian organisations released on Wednesday said 2,000 unaccompanied children were stranded on waiting lists for safe shelters in Greece, amid a chronic shortage of housing, with many sleeping rough. While interest has waned in the refugee crisis, humanitarian organisations and governments on the Mediterranean continue to mount rescue missions for stranded people, many of whom now attempt to cross through Libya. A recent CNN investigation in the country documented the horrific and widespread abuse of migrants and refugees, describing how some are sold as slaves in local markets after their capture. Human rights organisations have blamed the European Union, which is providing funds to curtail migration from Libya, for being complicit in the abuses."
2017-05-05T17:57:22Z,Giving migrants and refugees in London a place to stay | Letters,"It was heartbreaking and profoundly depressing to read about Paradzai Nkomo’s terrible experience (Living in limbo, G2, 4 May). What a shocking waste of talent, and a total disregard for women’s potential and what they can offer, wherever they come from. My family, dating right back to my grandmother and the East and West Friendship Council, have always welcomed visitors, students and refugees into our homes and we continue to do so through the Housing Justice’s London hosting network. Our current guest came to live in our spare room in October. He has been in the UK for 15 years, and is equally trapped in the idiocies of the system. He had been living on the night buses for three months, having been homeless for a year. He is one of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met, and has nothing but good to say about all those who he encountered in his enforced wanderings. He also had a plastic bag, and was on crutches. He is now in hospital, having become terribly ill as a result. I want Paradzai to know that there are many of us, and that we welcome her, and if we can help her in any way, we will. Above all, don’t despair.

2017-12-03T15:03:30Z,Donald Trump pulls US out of UN global compact on migration,"The Trump administration has pulled out of the United Nations’ ambitious plans to create a more humane global strategy on migration, saying involvement in the process interferes with American sovereignty, and runs counter to US immigration policies. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, informed the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, at the weekend that Donald Trump was not willing to continue with an American commitment to the UN global compact on migration. The announcement of the US withdrawal from the pact came hours before the opening of a UN global conference on migration scheduled to begin on Monday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. In 2016, the 193 members of the UN general assembly unanimously adopted a non-binding political declaration, the New York declaration for refugees and migrants, pledging to uphold the rights of refugees, help them resettle and ensure they had access to education and jobs. The initiative had the enthusiastic backing of Barack Obama, and was embraced by Guterres as one of his major challenges for 2018. The aim is to publish a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration next year in time for adoption by the UN general assembly in September. Louise Arbour, appointed as the UN’s special representative to oversee the process, regards the global compact as a chance to shift world opinion on the need to address future migration, in the same way that the UN had managed to persuade the world it needed to address climate change. There are currently 60 million people who have been displaced worldwide. The US decision to withdraw will delight Trump’s “America first” political base, but will do little to improve his standing in developing countries. The US mission to the UN said in a statement on Saturday that the declaration “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles”. The UN had always insisted that the compact was never intended to be legally binding on any country, but instead was an attempt to create a shared understanding that migration flows are likely to increase, and need to be regularised by recognising the reality of state interdependence, as much as national sovereignty. In a statement issued on Saturday, Haley said: “America is proud of our immigrant heritage and our longstanding moral leadership in providing support to migrant and refugee populations across the globe … But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.” She said: “We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York declaration is simply not compatible with US sovereignty.” The move, which is likely to put US-UN relations back in the deep freeze, came following pressure largely from the White House, as opposed to Haley herself. The US has already pulled out of the UN climate change treaty and Unesco, the cultural heritage body, accusing the latter’s leadership of an anti-Israeli bias. The impact of the migration pullout is more symbolic than practical, since the UN never had any illusion that it could control a member state’s policies."
2017-11-09T06:00:06Z,Anger rises in Lesbos over crowded refugee camps,"A surge in refugee arrivals has led to soaring tensions on Greece’s outlying Aegean islands, with Lesbos’s mayor accusing the government in Athens of allowing it to become a giant prison camp. Boycotting celebrations on Wednesday marking the 105th anniversary of Lesbos’s liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule, local officials gave the leftist-led coalition in Athens an ultimatum: either it took immediate action to decongest the island or risked mass protests from an increasingly unruly population. “We are utterly opposed to policies that are turning Lesbos and other border areas into concentration camps where all human dignity is denied,” said Spyros Galinos, the island’s mayor. “The government has failed to keep to its commitment to effectively deal with this problem and move people on.” The explosive mood matches the rising number of asylum seekers on Lesbos, the gateway for the vast majority of refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the crisis in 2015. Close to 6,000 people are being held at the island’s main camp in Moria, which was initially established as a temporary measure to house no more than 2,000. After a fourfold daily increase in arrivals nationwide over the past three months, the Greek immigration minister Ioannis Mouzalas said the government was considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. “The rise is concerning,” he told a recent news conference in Athens. Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey to stem the influx in March 2016, refugees reaching Greek islands are forbidden from travelling to the mainland pending completion of asylum requests. As a result nearly 15,000 men, women and children are stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the Aegean islands closest to Turkey’s shores, according to figures released by Greece’s interior ministry. In Lesbos and Samos more than 8,300 asylum seekers and migrants are living in facilities meant for just 3,000. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that refugee and migrant numbers jumped from 3,665 in August to 4,604 in September. “After the fall of Mosul there has been a discernible increase … and 98% of those who come request asylum,” explained Daniel Esdras, the IOM’s Greece office director. “Any change in a conflict zone will automatically have a huge impact on migratory flows.” The containment policy has been denounced by human rights groups. In a letter last month to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, 18 organisations said the abysmal conditions in which people were being made to live – including the elderly, infirm and vulnerable – were placing lives at risk. Municipal authorities have reacted furiously to suggestions that camps be enlarged and new ones established, arguing that expansion in any form will only lure more refugees and migrants. At the height of the refugee crisis before countries along the Balkan corridor closed their frontiers and shut off entry to Europe, locals on Lesbos exhibited extraordinary compassion, rushing to greet refugees and offering aid. But the failure to effectively decongest the islands since the EU-Turkey deal was signed has prompted growing anger with residents blaming overcrowding for almost every ill, including the rise in crime. Alleviation was necessary not only to maintain the dignity of people fleeing poverty and war but to “protect social cohesion in a border area that is of national significance to Greece”, its town hall said. Officials in Athens have been reluctant to criticise Ankara for the increase in numbers, instead attributing the rise to a reflection of Turkey’s strained relations with the EU before a visit to Greece in early December by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “We are Turkey’s neighbour, we are not Luxembourg and so we are careful about what we say,” Ioannis Balafas, the deputy migration minister, told the Guardian. “What we are seeing is a political game. Whenever Turkey wants to put the pressure on Europe it turns on the tap and lets more [people] through.” Giorgos Koumoutsakos, the shadow minister of foreign affairs in the main opposition New Democracy party, agreed. “If it really wanted to, Turkey could more effectively control the flows,” he said. “What we are seeing, it would seem, is a reflection of Turkey’s problematic relationship with the EU.” In the meantime, Greece’s easternmost islands were paying the price."
2017-12-11T16:25:19Z,EU could 'scrap refugee quota scheme',"The EU could scrap a divisive scheme that compels member states to accept quotas of refugees, one of the bloc’s most senior leaders will say this week. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, will tell EU leaders at a summit on Thursday that mandatory quotas have been divisive and ineffective, in a clear sign that he is ready to abandon the policy that has created bitter splits across the continent. Tusk will set a six-month deadline for EU leaders to reach unanimous agreement on reforms to the European asylum system, but will propose alternatives if there is no consensus. “If there is no solution … including on the issue of mandatory quotas, the president of the European council will present a way forward,” states a draft letter from Tusk to national capitals, seen by the Guardian. In effect this means scrapping mandatory quotas, because Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are fiercely opposed to the idea of dispersing refugees around the bloc based on a formula drawn up in Brussels. Tusk is likely to face opposition, however, from other EU bodies, including the European commission. EU leaders introduced compulsory quotas in 2015 at the height of the migration crisis, as thousands of people arrived daily on Europe’s shores, many of whom were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea. Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the move, but the policy was forced through by a majority vote. Hungary and Poland have defied the rest of the EU by not taking a single refugee under the scheme, which aimed to relocate about 120,000 refugees, mainly Syrians. The Czech republic has taken in only 12. All three countries were referred to the European court of justice last week for failing to implement the policy, the usual procedure for flouting EU rules. Despite the backlash against the emergency scheme, the European commission proposed making quotas a permanent feature of EU law in 2016. Under its proposal, countries that refuse to take part in a “corrective allocation mechanism” to take the pressure off member states bearing the brunt would have to pay a “solidarity contribution” of €250,000 (£220,000) per asylum seeker. The idea has been stalled for months, as home affairs ministers who make the law have been unable to agree on it. Any move to drop the plan is likely to upset Italy and Greece, countries that have urged the rest of the EU to help them cope with large numbers of refugees and migrants in recent years. Germany and Sweden, backed by the European commission, are also likely to contest any plan deemed to reduce the help offered by other member states. One EU diplomat said some member states were surprised by Tusk’s letter “because it doesn’t seem to be in sync” with work undertaken by home affairs ministers working on the file. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, thinks mandatory quotas have been a gift to hardliners, such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has seized on migration as part of his wider Stop Brussels campaign. Eurosceptics in Poland, such as the Law and Justice leader Jarosław Kaczyński, whose party won an election victory over Tusk’s centre-right group in October 2015, have also criticised the policy. Tusk’s scepticism about the prospect of consensus has been evident for months. He said in October that mandatory quotas had put members states in almost permanent conflict. Tusk will call on EU governments to take charge, rather than leaving Brussels to set the pace in managing refugee policy. “Only member states are able to tackle the migration crisis effectively,” Tusk’s letter says. “The EU’s role is to offer its full support in all possible ways to help member states handle the migration crisis. But the EU has neither the capacity nor legal possibilities to replace member states.” He will also urge EU leaders to spend more on schemes aimed at keeping refugees and would-be migrants outside Europe, such as €3bn for Syrian refugees in Turkey and the €1.9bn EU Africa trust fund. The EU will confront an earlier promise to give Turkey’s government a further €3bn to help Syrian refugees in early 2018, which could lead to a repeat of EU institutions asking governments to find more cash. The EU has improvised such schemes in response to crises, but Tusk wants more funds available from the new seven-year budget covering the period from 2021, which will come up for discussion next year. He is calling for “stable and long-term financing mechanisms, in place of the existing ad hoc pledging on a much larger scale”, but has stopped short of putting a price tag on future migration policy."
2017-11-01T22:28:40Z,Foster carers housing lone child refugees to receive specialist training,"The government has announced specialist training for 1,000 foster carers looking after unaccompanied migrant children, ahead of a key court ruling on a decision to wind up a scheme under which child refugees are brought to the UK. The announcement comes as ministers face criticism for the UK’s failure to accept any child refugees from Greece or Italy since the Dubs scheme to help settle lone child asylum seekers was created last year. Only 200 vulnerable children have been brought to the UK under the scheme; a further 280 places offered by councils around the UK are currently unfilled. A court case brought by the charity Help Refugees will rule on Thursday morning on the legality of a government decision not to continue with the Dubs scheme, designed to bring vulnerable refugee children in Europe to the UK. The charity launched a legal challenge in the summer on whether the government had failed to implement the Dubs amendment properly. Robert Goodwill, minister for children and families, said: “Child refugees are some of the most vulnerable in our country and it is vital that we support them as they build safer lives, often in the care of new families. Foster carers do an incredible job, but they must have tailored support to help them deal with the complex needs of these children.” The new training scheme for foster carers and support workers will get £200,000 in funding between 2017 and 2019, the government said. An additional £60,000 investment will provide a package of revised guidance, information and resources for councils. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said: “Last year almost 3,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in the UK and they all require ongoing care and protection.” The government’s new safeguarding strategy on unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee children received a qualified welcome from charities supporting refugee children. Ilona Pinter, from the Children’s Society, said it was a constructive move, but that she was worried that the “government has not committed to reviewing access to legal aid for unaccompanied children’s immigration applications to remain in the UK”. These issues, as well as post-Brexit arrangements for child refugees, will be debated in parliament later on Thursday. Around 200 migrant children hoping to travel to the UK are currently sleeping rough in Calais and nearby port towns. Roughly a third are believed to have family in the UK. The French government this week opened a temporary centre for unaccompanied child refugees in the town, a year after the informal camp that housed 10,000 migrants by the French port was demolished, according to the British charity Safe Passage, which campaigns for safe legal routes for refugees seeking protection. Run by the French children’s charity France Terre d’Asile, the centre will offer around 20 places and is expected to be temporary, according to Safe Passage’s French-based staff. No official announcement has been made about the centre’s opening, although it is understood to have allowed some children in on Monday. The centre is designed to accommodate young people hoping to be reunited with family in the UK and those deemed eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs scheme, the charity said. The decision to open the centre is a significant move, given the reluctance of French authorities to create any kind of centre that might attract more migrants to the port. It will mean that those young people housed there will no longer have to sleep in the bushes around the port. Since the camp’s demolition last year, local police have routinely removed tents and any semi-permanent structures from the woods on the town’s outskirts, leaving migrants to live in the open, with no access to sanitation, tents, showers or food. Alf Dubs, who arrived as a child in the UK as a kindertransport refugee and who persuaded the government to set up the scheme for unaccompanied child refugees (which was originally designed to help up to 3,000 children), said: “The development of a centre near Calais is welcome, but it must be permanent and provide legal support to children trying to access safe and legal routes to Britain. “We must put an end to desperate children jumping on lorries, risking their lives and others as they seek to reach their loved ones – as is their legal right.”"
2017-12-20T12:00:26Z,Coming to the aid of drowning migrants? Get ready to be treated like a criminal | Lorena Gazzotti,"Activists and NGOs defending migrants’ rights will remember 2017 as the year in which they were targeted by legal systems in Europe and north Africa. Take the case of Helena Maleno Garzón, a Spanish journalist and human rights advocate. You may not have heard of her. But authorities on both sides of the strait of Gibraltar know her well. Maleno, who has been living in Tangier since 2001, will on 27 December face a hearing as part of an investigation by Moroccan authorities into her alleged collusion with smuggling and human-trafficking networks. Central to the case are the calls that Maleno has been making to the Spanish and the Moroccan coastguards since 2007 about boats in distress in the strait and the Alboran Sea. Because of their proximity to migrant communities in northern Morocco, Maleno and other activists regularly receive distress calls, and they relay the signals to naval authorities, a vital step in ensuring migrants’ rescue. You may think what she does is simply humane, but the Moroccan investigation mirrors proceedings on the Spanish side of the strait, where police launched an investigation based on similar allegations a few years ago. It was dropped earlier this year due to lack of evidence of any criminal activity. One can see why governments are trying to discourage Maleno. Her work has made her an inconvenient witness to the deadly consequences of border surveillance policies. Unlawful deportations from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, migrants injured by border guards during attempts to jump the fences dividing Spanish and Moroccan territory, countless migrants perishing in the strait: these are just some facts documented by Maleno in a recent report for the collective Caminando Fronteras. These are events that demand authorities live up to their responsibilities – and address human rights violations and the humiliating living conditions endured each day by migrants at the border. This story is part of a disturbing pattern in which European states are attempting to criminalise activists operating in different parts of the Mediterranean. Consider the allegations of facilitating irregular migration directed by Italian authorities at NGOs conducting search and rescue in the central Mediterranean, or the French farmer Cédric Herrou, given a suspended jail sentence for assisting migrants arriving from Italy. The investigation in Italy into the NGO Jugend Rettet, an organisation of young Europeans who perform search and rescue missions, is continuing. What is happening here seems clear: in order to sustain current border policies, allegations of facilitating migration and collusion with smuggling networks have become the new weapon on both shores of the Mediterranean to discredit those who challenge restrictive migration policies. The presence of activists and solidarity networks at crossing points troubles those in charge of European migration policies for two reasons. First, there is the enduring myth of the “pull factor”, which says that providing assistance to distressed migrants increases their willingness to cross. Decreasing the pull factors, they say, will reduce the number of migrants making for the Mediterranean’s European coast – even though research has largely disproved this argument. Second, NGOs and activists are inconvenient witnesses to the brutal and inhumane consequences of migration policies. The work of activists like Maleno, patiently collecting testimony that contradicts official explanations, has led to judicial procedures being reopened. This includes the investigation into the deaths in 2014 of 15 migrants off Tarajal beach, in Ceuta, allegedly as a result of the actions of Spanish civil guards. The criminalisation of activists and solidarity networks reduces and discourage the ability of independent actors to monitor and criticise the conduct of state authorities, which is a principle of the democratic process. To appease the obsession for border control, these unfair attacks undermine that democratic scrutiny. But the damage goes further. Discouraging activists bolsters the view that some lives are worth less than others. And that the fact that migrants might perish during the crossing should be simply accepted as part of the game. Commenting on her own case, Maleno raised the concern that should worry everybody. “The most painful thing,” she said. “Is the normalisation of the loss of the right to life.” • Lorena Gazzotti is an academic specialising in migration and refugee studies"
2017-02-02T15:39:50Z,Coldplay throw support behind refugee and migrant charity,"Coldplay have thrown their support behind a charity which has saved the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing war and persecution in the Middle East. The band, which has a long history of support for a range of charitable causes, has become a long-term patron of Moas (Migrant Offshore Aid Station), which operates professional search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin said: “Every year, Moas rescue thousands of people who risk death at sea while searching for a better life. But for an accident of geography, those people could be us and we could be them. For this reason, we’re proud to support Moas’ life-saving work”. Over the past two years Moas boats have rescued an estimated 33,000 refugees attempting perilous crossings to Europe in often overcrowded and unseaworthy rubber dinghies. The majority of refugees were from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Last year, at least 5,079 refugees and migrants drowned while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to the UN Migration Agency, although some charities believe this figure is likely to be an underestimate. Martin sings an a capella version of his song Don’t Panic on a short fundraising film released on Thursday that features footage of a recent rescue. Moas said the film “aims to give the viewer an immersive experience of a rescue and show the fear, hope and anguish experienced by the refugees and migrants”. The timing of the band’s announcement came amid increasing global political tension over refugees and border controls, including Donald Trump announcing controversial measures designed to prevent refugees from entering the US. Moas said that in light of recent political developments Coldplay believed it was more important than ever to support vulnerable people. Founder Regina Catrambone said: “We are very grateful to Coldplay for believing so strongly in our cause”. “Moas is a young organisation that in a few years has managed to make a significant difference in mitigating one of the most heart-breaking humanitarian tragedies of our era. However, there is still so much to be done. Coldplay’s support will allow our work to reach the hearts of a wider audience worldwide.” Moas was founded in 2014 by two Italian-American entrepreneurs, Chris and Regina Catrambone, after a humanitarian disaster in October 2013 when an estimated 400 people drowned off the island of Lampedusa. It was one of six refugee charities that benefited from the Guardian and Observer’s 2015 charity appeal, which raised £2.6m. Coldplay have supported a number of charities over the years, including Oxfam, the Red Cross, War Child, Amnesty International and Kids Company. Martin reportedly donates 10% of his annual income to charity."
2017-12-14T18:04:49Z,Bitter divisions over migration threaten show of unity at EU summit,"Divisions over migration marred a show of unity at an EU summit on Thursday, after Germany and Italy hit back at plans that could spell the end of mandatory refugee quotas. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have led criticism of a proposal from the European council president, Donald Tusk, who has described refugee quotas as “divisive and ineffective”. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, whose country has struggled to manage large numbers of refugees and migrants, criticised Tusk’s comments as “aimless, ill-timed and pointless”. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said there “cannot be selective solidarity” among EU member states”. Germany gave refuge to more than 1 million asylum seekers in 2015 and has been championing the policy of sharing refugees through quotas, when numbers could overwhelm other countries. “We need solidarity not just in regulating and steering migration,” Merkel said, “but we also need internal solidarity.” The row threatens to overshadow an EU summit insiders hoped would be a show of unity, with leaders launching landmark plans for greater military cooperation and basking in a common position on the first phase of Brexit talks. Only three countries – Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic – came out strongly in favour of Tusk’s plan ahead of the summit. The Czech Republic’s new prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said any attempt to impose “nonsensical” quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the EU. “It won’t happen.” Poland’s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he was happy that Poland’s opposition to allowing refugees into Europe seemed to be gaining acceptance. Poland, along with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, pledged €35m (£30m) for Italian-led projects to protect the border at Libya, as part of EU efforts to stem the flow of people attempting the dangerous journey to Europe. Speaking after the summit broke up, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he was happy with the contribution, but money was not enough. “This is what every country is doing. This cannot come in the place of, instead of being willing to take up your fair share in terms of the burden-sharing.” The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, welcomed the financial contribution but said the four countries still needed to accept refugees. “We will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.” Officials have been even blunter in private: one European diplomat told his counterparts that Tusk’s paper should be put in the bin. Another diplomatic source said it was badly written and “much too unbalanced in favour” of central Europe. However, another EU diplomat, from a country supporting quotas, said it was “time to attack the issue”, which was “starting to poison” other debates. “At this point in time, what I am expecting is a good old bust up and in a later phase we will narrow the field of possible outcomes.” The EU is not aiming to reach conclusions on this thorny issue at the summit. “Divisions are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find even a common language and rational arguments for this debate,” Tusk said, referring to the chasm of opinion on migration, but also the future of the single currency. EU leaders agreed on compulsory quotas at the height of the migration crisis in 2015, despite opposition from four central and eastern european countries. The bloc is discussing whether to make quotas a permanent feature of the EU’s asylum system, but the proposals have been making slow progress. The Tusk plan, reported by the Guardian earlier this week, took countries by surprise and is seen as out of step with months of work done by EU home affairs ministers. The European commission, backed by several member states, has also been infuriated by what it sees as a march on to its turf of proposing EU laws and policies. In his letter to leaders, Tusk said he would present “a way forward for consideration by leaders” after June 2018 if there was no consensus. “The European council [that Tusk leads] is not a legislative body,” said an EU diplomat. “I don’t think he can mean we should bypass our normal procedures.” The commission has also been irritated by Tusk’s claim that the 2015 quota system was a failure. “The commission firmly disagrees with the statement that relocation as an emergency response has been ‘ineffective’,” a spokeswoman said. “Over 32,000 people have been relocated – over 90% of all those eligible.” The commission said member states should be working towards a European approach. “Returning to a pre-crisis mode of isolated, uncoordinated, national action is not an option and would betray years’ worth of collective work to better the collective European response to managing migration.” The UK, which has an opt-out from this part of EU asylum policy, has been sitting on the sidelines of the debate and has never taken part in mandatory refugee relocation."
2017-07-31T18:12:37Z,France to provide water and open centres for refugees near Calais,"The French government has said it will provide water and sanitation to refugees and migrants in Calais and open two reception centres away from the port, hours after a court ordered it to end the inhuman treatment of migrants. France’s highest administrative court ruled that President Emmanuel Macron’s government and the Calais region must provide hundreds of refugees with drinking water, showers and toilets. The ruling came almost a year after the makeshift refugee camp in Calais, home to thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK, was bulldozed by French authorities. It was a setback for the local Calais authorities who had been taking a hard line with any new sign of settlements, discouraging charities from providing tents or food. Calais is still proving attractive to migrants searching a better life in the UK, although the numbers are significantly lower than last October and November when the camp was cleared. France’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, said there were about 350-400 refugees and migrants around Calais compared with 10,000 at the peak last year. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past but we also want to handle the problems in Calais,” Collomb said, indicating a determination to avoid providing facilities that could draw migrants to the town, making it once more a hub for those trying to reach Britain. A local court said this year that the authorities must provide access to water, prompting an appeal by the interior ministry and Calais commune. Rejecting that appeal, the Conseil d’État ruled that the treatment of migrants was inhuman. “The Conseil d’État considers that these living conditions reveal a failure by the public authorities that has exposed these people to inhuman or degrading treatment,” the court said in a statement. “These shortcomings are a serious and unlawful infringement on a fundamental freedom.” On Monday the court said the lower court was within its rights to order the provision of toilets, drinking water and showers. While Macron has called for migrants to be treated with dignity, his own government has taken a tough stance, refusing to open a new migrant reception centre in Calais, saying it would act as a magnet for other migrants. Last week, Human Rights Watch pressed France to end what it described as recurrent police violence against refugees and migrants in Calais, where hundreds have returned despite the demolition of the sprawling camp. The European Union is struggling to find a coherent answer to a migration crisis that has tested cooperation between member states. Macron has instructed his government to speed up France’s asylum process."
2017-12-17T20:50:03Z,"Nepali migrant workers ‘systematically’ exploited, Amnesty says","Nepali migrant workers continue to be trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation, according to new research by Amnesty International. A survey by Amnesty has found two-thirds of migrant workers have paid excessive or illegal recruitment fees. The phone survey of 414 Nepali migrant workers found 88% paid fees to agents for their jobs overseas. The fees were claimed to be so high that the majority had to borrow more than half the sum from village moneylenders, placing them in debt. More than half of the workers surveyed – 53% – said they received lower monthly salaries than was promised to them by recruitment agents. James Lynch, the deputy director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme, said: “Nepali migrant workers are being systematically and mercilessly set up. Forced to take out loans to pay the huge fees recruitment agencies charge them to work abroad, they are left so indebted they have no choice but to stay in jobs which often turn out to be low paid or dangerous. “The Nepali government’s weak enforcement of the law is playing straight into the hands of extortionists and loan sharks,” he said. “Migrant workers all too often end up trapped in a soul-destroying situation of working abroad for years simply to pay off huge, often illegal fees they were charged to take the job. Tackling this exploitative industry is a matter of urgency.”"
2017-11-16T13:14:42Z,"Teenage Nigerian girls drowned at sea, Italian autopsies confirm","Autopsies on the bodies of 26 Nigerian teenage girls recovered from the Mediterranean this month have confirmed that they drowned. The bodies of the girls, aged between 14 and 18, were brought to the southern Italian port of Salerno by the Spanish ship Cantabria on 5 November. An investigation was opened due to fears they may have been abused and killed. But Prof Antonello Crisci, a medic who worked on the postmortems, said the girls died from drowning after the dinghies they were travelling in sank. “There were no signs that they had been raped or physically abused,” he said. “They most likely couldn’t swim.” The bodies were recovered by Cantabria, which works as part of the EU’s Sophia anti-trafficking operation, from two shipwrecks – 23 from one and three from the other. One of the women also suffered a “hemorrhagic shock” due to a liver wound, and two were pregnant, the doctor added. At least 100 other migrants who were also attempting the treacherous crossing from Libya to Europe are missing and almost certain to have drowned, prosecutors said on Wednesday. A further 375 people were brought to safety across two search-and-rescue missions. Two men, who were among the survivors and are believed to have skippered one of the boats, were arrested in Salerno the day after the bodies were brought to the port on charges of people trafficking. Marco Rotunno, an Italy spokesman for the UN refugee agency, told the Guardian last week that 90% of migrant and refugee women arrive in the country with bruises or other signs of violence. People continue to attempt the crossing despite a pact between Italy and Libya to stem the flow, which led to a near 70% drop in arrivals since the summer, according to figures released this month by Italy’s interior ministry. Italy defended the agreement on Wednesday after it was lambasted by the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, as being “inhuman”. Rights groups have denounced the policy, saying it exposes returned migrants to Libya’s lawless detention centres with no legal recourse. There have long been reports of the horrific abuses suffered by migrants in war-stricken Libya at the hands of traffickers and others, with the International Organisation for Migration saying in April that thousands of Africans are being sold in “slave markets”. “The suffering of migrants detained in Libya is an outrage to the conscience of humanity,” Hussein said in a statement issued on Tuesday. “The European Union’s policy of assisting the Libyan coastguard to intercept and return migrants in the Mediterranean [is] inhuman.” Italy’s interior minister, Marco Minniti, defended the deal, saying: “The alternative cannot be to resign ourselves to the impossibility of managing migratory flows and hand human traffickers the keys to European democracies. “We invite all those who are giving lessons to instead give more funds, more logistical support and more intervention in Libya to solve this issue.”"
2017-12-06T09:55:35Z,Greek refugee camps 'beyond desperate' as islanders protest in Athens,"Humanitarian groups have warned of a looming emergency on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands, the day after residents converged on Athens in protest at policies that have led to thousands of migrants and refugees being marooned in reception centres. A surge in arrivals from neighbouring Turkey has seen numbers soar with officials speaking of a four-fold increase in men, women and children seeking asylum on Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos. Conditions are deteriorating in the vastly overcrowded camps in a situation that Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on Wednesday warned was “beyond desperate”. “In Lesbos, entire families who recently arrived from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are packed into small summer tents, under the rain and in low temperatures struggling to keep dry and warm,” said Aria Danika, MSF’s project coordinator on the island. “In our mental health clinic we have received an average of 10 patients with acute mental distress every day, including many who tried to kill themselves or self-harm. The situation on the island was already terrible. Now it’s beyond desperate.” Demonstrators – led by delegations of officials from Chios, Lesbos and Samos – gathered in the Athens sunshine on Tuesday to demand that the government move people out of camps. “Action has to be taken now, before it is too late,” said Panos Pitsios, president of the town council of Mytilene, Lesbos’s capital. “We are heading towards an eruption, a situation that is on the verge of getting out of control.” The island, the gateway for an estimated 800,000 refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the refugee crisis two years ago, is now housing more than 7,000 people in facilities with a capacity of 2,300. The strategy of stranding migrants and refugees in remote camps where tensions have also mounted between rival ethnicities has also been condemned by human rights groups. Organisations increasingly fear that unless asylum seekers are transferred to the mainland where facilities are less crowded and better equipped, thousands could be left out in the cold as winter approaches. As of last week, reception centres on the isles were almost 7,200 over capacity, condemning inmates to live in appalling conditions with lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities and health services. Mayors from all five islands said in a proclamation handed to the migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, that Athens’ containment policies had turned their communities into “island prisons”. “There has to be immediate decongestion of the islands,” Chios’s mayor, Manolis Vournous, told the Guardian. “There simply isn’t the infrastructure to cope.” About 2,500 people, he said, were currently stuck in Vial, the island’s main camp, purpose-built to hold no more than 800. “It is an intolerable situation that is putting human lives at risk and endangering social cohesion. It has to end.” The leftist-led Greek government argues it is hamstrung by a landmark accord reached between the EU and Turkey to stem the flows last year. Under the agreement, asylum seekers arriving on Greek islands must remain in situ until their requests are approved – a process made longer by a notoriously slow-moving justice system that has been impacted by the country’s long-running economic crisis. The enforced wait is exacerbated by the spectre that, if rejected, asylum seekers will be forcibly returned to Turkey. In recent weeks, prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s administration has taken steps to alleviate the situation – transferring hundreds of migrants by ship to Athens. Mouzalas recently announced that the government was also considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. But with more than 15,000 people officially registered in state-run camps on the isles, the measures were described as “hopelessly inadequate” by locals. “More than a third of Mytilene’s total population are migrants and refugees,” said Pitsios. “Residents are afraid at night to even leave their homes and now they are at the end of their tether.”"
2017-11-08T18:33:48Z,Migrants only cross borders as last resort | Letters,"You are right that migrants attempt the journey to Europe even though they know the risks (They know the risks and still they come: why young Africans chase the European dream, theguardian.com, 6 November). This is because they have no choice, and there are not enough safe and legal routes available. They are fleeing persecution, abuse and poverty and migrating is a last resort for the majority. Our new report released this week based on interviews with 67 Eritreans shows that the joint EU-Africa policy intended to help migrants and refugees, known as the Khartoum Process, is in fact part of the problem. It pushes the problem offshore and creates risks for vulnerable people. Our findings show that people decide to cross borders irregularly and take extreme risks when alternative options are perceived to be equally bad, or worse. What policy makers view as an ill-informed decision is often calculated risk-taking. Most of those fleeing persecution, human rights abuses, conflict and poverty are not even attempting to get to Europe and remain in the region. We argue that a new approach is needed – one in which there is a shift in focus on to the political context in which migration takes place, rather than the criminality that it attracts. Tackling the symptoms rather than the causes of migration will do little to change the current equation in which people take considerable risks for want of alternatives.

2017-11-03T17:11:42Z,Europe’s top human rights job deserves better. We urge Greece to choose again | Kostis Papaioannou and Vassilis Papadopoulos,"The Greek government’s decision to put forward its current minister of migration as a candidate for Europe’s top human rights job must seem reasonable to many people outside Greece. Our country was forced to deal with record arrivals of refugees at a time when it is already struggling to emerge from a serious financial crisis. The humanity displayed by many Greeks in responding to these twin crises has earned the country the moral right to be heard. But the nomination of Ioannis Mouzalas for Human Rights Commissioner at the Council of Europe has caused serious concern in Greece itself. His term as migration minister is not one that has promoted respect for human rights. The choice of this commissioner is of particular importance because the role oversees human rights conditions and detects problems in law and administrative practice; it also proposes recommendations and follows up on their implementation. The commissioner must act according to the basic principles of the Council of Europe, an institutional pillar for the protection of human rights. The incumbent, Nils Muiznieks, has expressed serious concern about the deal struck between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to stem the flow of Syrian refugees into Greece, in which aid and political concessions were offered to Ankara. The Greek minister, on the contrary, has been one of the most ardent protectors of this controversial agreement. He has insisted on implementation of the deal and refused any input from national and international stakeholders regarding its impact on human rights. In cases where the EU-Turkey deal has not been implemented fully, and no Syrian refugee has been forcibly returned to Turkey, this is because of the determined resistance of civil society organisations as well as public servants. When the independent committees that decide asylum appeal claims in Greece ruled in favour of claimants who were resisting being sent back to Turkey, Mouzalas was accused of intervening to influence their decisions. When this did not work, he amended the law to change the composition of the committees and speed up the return of Syrians to Turkey. This interference directly contradicted the principles of the Council of Europe – the very body in which he is now a candidate for a senior role. The minister’s support for the EU Turkey deal should at least have triggered unease about nominating him for a top institutional position. Especially one that implies an unwavering stance in support of human rights in general, and respect for the rights of refugees in particular. We presume that consistency with the principles of the Council of Europe will be taken into account when the nominees are considered. Far from there being positive work leading to his nomination, there is, unfortunately, plenty of evidence of the opposite. Multiple reports from Greek and international organisations, including an investigation in the Guardian, have raised very serious reservations about the management of the refugee issue. The EU policy, backed by the Greek government, has led to thousands of refugees and migrants being trapped in unacceptable conditions on the Greek islands. Last winter this confinement to the islands and mismanagement led to the loss of life. There has been no meaningful investigation to establish responsibility for these deaths. The failure to provide adequate camp facilities or the structures and rules needed to properly administer the refugee population belongs in part to Mouzalas. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, among others, has already warned about the danger of a repeat of similar failings this winter. The policy supported by Mouzalas has also placed an unreasonable burden on local communities on the islands where new arrivals are confined. This was done without any planning or attempts to gain local support and has resulted in a serious risk of social and political unrest. This agreement is becoming a paradigm on how to undermine the post-second world war refugee protection apparatus. Its strict implementation has badly damaged the rule of law. Even if Greece had no choice but to accept the EU-Turkey deal, what we have managed is the worst possible version: entrapping and dehumanising asylum seekers in a punitive way beyond what the deal formally envisioned. We often criticize the negative political stance of central European countries that target refugees and do not take their share of responsibility as EU members. But for this criticism to be essential, we ought to contrast it with our own politics. It is clear that the Greek government should think again on its decision to propose Mouzalas as a candidate for human rights commissioner at the Council of Europe. • Kostis Papaioannou is the former secretary general for human rights in the Greek government.

2017-11-22T16:36:09Z,Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies spotted in the UK,"Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies have been spotted in the UK this year, according to an analysis by volunteers from the Migrant Dragonfly Project. The study recorded the first confirmed UK sighting of the scarlet darter for 13 years, at Longham Lakes in Dorset. It is only the eighth time this species has been spotted in Britain. Volunteers also recorded the second largest ever immigration of red-veined darters into the UK, and there have been multiple influxes of both vagrant emperor and lesser emperor dragonflies. Eleanor Colver, conservation officer for the British Dragonfly Society, said: “we are currently seeing major shifts in the range of dragonfly species on a global scale, not just in the UK.” She added: “Dragonflies, like all insects, cannot regulate their body temperature like humans, so are highly sensitive to small changes in environmental temperature. As a result, we believe that some of the changes we are witnessing in our local dragonflies are their response to the ongoing global warming.” Adrian Parr, co-ordinator of the Migrant Dragonfly Project, said the record number in the UK was helped by warm weather and southerly winds in spring and early summer as well as good breeding conditions in the traditional dragonfly homelands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Unlike the situation with birds, whose migrations are well-known, our understanding of insect (and particularly dragonfly) migration is still in its infancy,” said Parr. “It is clearly, however, an important phenomenon, and one that tells us a lot about the living world.” Parr said scarlet darters are usually found across central Europe, Africa, the Middle East and western Asia and that they are “one of the most generalist dragonfly species, able to live in a variety of standing-water habitats, ranging from brackish pools to freshwater ditches.” According to the project, Britain has been colonised by four new species of dragonfly in the past 20 years, including the willow emerald damselfly and small red-eyed damselfly, and seen the return of the dainty damselfly, which had last been seen in 1953."
2017-12-26T11:00:46Z,Desperate plight of Rohingya refugees hits home in Bradford,"It took the best part of 36 hours to travel from his Victorian terrace home in Bradford to the ever-growing refugee camp in southern Bangladesh. But of the 5,000 mile trip it was the final few hundred metres that were the hardest. “When I was 500 metres from my parents home I was crying loudly,” said Deen Mohammed Noori. The 32-year-old had been reunited with his parents after nine years; their address is printed in black ink on official UN records: Kutupalong, Block D, Shed 0026. Noori’s parents are among hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees living in what has rapidly become the world’s largest refugee camp, with nearly 1 million stateless people living in makeshift settlements on the edge of Kutupalong, near Cox’s Bazar. For Noori, the bamboo and tarpaulin huts are a reminder of the life he was fortunate enough to escape in 2010, when he was among 199 Rohingya refugees who settled in Bradford under the International Organisation for Migration’s gateway protection programme. The Bradford Rohingyas, the biggest community of the ethnic group in Europe, have watched with increasing horror as more than 670,000 of their ethnic group – often described as the “world’s most persecuted people” – have fled the destruction of their villages in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Noori now works as a taxi driver in Bradford while running the Arakan Rohingya Organisation UK from his family home in the centre of the city, where he lives with his wife and children. He returned from his four-week trip to Kutupalong on 30 November with graphic horror stories and a renewed determination to ask the British government for sanctuary for his elderly relatives. “My mum didn’t want me to come back here. I wanted to bring my parents with me. Why can’t I take them with with me to the country where I live? It was a sad moment for me when I was coming back to the airport,” he said. “Every time we go out ... we feel sad all the time. We feel disappointed because my parents are not here.” The city council has given the Rohingya community a small office in a community centre in the Laisterdyke neighbourhood of east Bradford, where they can meet and organise. In October, Nijam Uddin Mohammed, general secretary of the British Rohingya Community UK, and nine others took aid to desperate families in Kutupalong, donating food, firewood and medicine from the people of Bradford. Although the vast majority of Rohingya refugees are Muslim, the donations came from every faith and none, said Mohammed. “Donations came from all over Bradford regardless of faith. We’ve been very surprised: the mosques, churches, temples – everyone has come out to help us.” Nur Huda, chairman of the British Rohingya Community UK, took his 11-year-old daughter, Nurun Nessa Sumai, on the 5,000-mile journey to the country where they had lived in exile until 2008, when they were among the first Rohingya refugees to be welcomed to Bradford under its City of Sanctuary scheme. Sumai, who started secondary school in September at Bradford’s Feversham college for girls, said she had returned to Yorkshire with a new appreciation for the most basic things in life. “Here [children] take everything for granted, and they [children in Kutupalong] are just hoping they have parents, proper education, nice food, nice clothes and everything, good toys to play with, find friends and all the things we take for granted today,” she said. “We get water, they don’t have that much clean water. They don’t have anything – they have to sleep on the streets. They never know if someone’s going to trip over them or anything. They’re just lying there hoping that something good will happen to them, but they don’t have much hope now.” Of all the distressing sights and stories in Kutupalong, Mohammed said, it was the plight of the children that raised the greatest alarm. More than 600,000 Rohingya children are at risk in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to Unicef, which estimates that almost 60% of the nearly 1 million people to have fled the violence are children – and 21% of those under five are malnurished. Mohammed, who grew up in Kutupalong, said he feared the lack of education was the greatest threat to the future of his people. Fewer than 1% of 720,000 children classed as “in need” are currently receiving any form of education, according to Unicef. “Nearly 1 million people, their children are without education. What are these children’s destinations going to be? “Sometimes you kill people with weapons. This time, if children are away from education, then my Rohingya nation will be completely disappeared slowly,” he said."
2018-11-28T18:33:30Z,Refugee agency accused of helping deport relatives of migrant children,"The federal agency tasked with caring for asylum-seeking children separated from their parents at the US-Mexican border has officially taken on a new, little-publicized role in recent months: helping to deport relatives of the young migrants. More than 40 potential sponsors of detained migrant children in the US may be deported because a government agency that is supposed to help refugees instead uses minors to glean information on their US-based relatives, activists warned on Wednesday. Civil rights advocates said in a letter to top Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Wednesday that this data is being employed to “arrest and deport those families”, making these relatives “too scared to step forward to sponsor children”. The initiative – described as an information-sharing accord that was “quietly” solidified in April – reflects a novel role for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which comes under the HHS umbrella. The HHS section is supposed to help unaccompanied migrant children by reuniting them with family until their immigration cases are decided. “Children are being turned into bait to gather unprecedented amounts of information from immigrant communities,” Becky Wolozin, a Legal Aid Justice Center lawyer, said in the letter. From July to September, at least 41 family or household members of children who have been separated from their parents were detained for deportation due to this information-swapping. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) official recently told Congress that more than 80% of potential sponsors lived in the US illegally. Potential sponsors’ fingerprints and other personal information are entered into a DHS system. While this database was initially meant to track criminal records, it was modified in May to assist with immigration verification. Because authorities at local, state and federal levels of the US government have extensive access to this data, would-be sponsors could be put under unprecedented scrutiny. While federal authorities maintain this initiative is geared toward protecting migrant children from abusers and traffickers, migrant children entering the US unlawfully are spending increasing amounts of time in federal custody. Bob Carey, who ran the resettlement agency for nearly two years until January 2017, said the average time in custody for unaccompanied children “hovered around 33 days the entire time I was there”. Now it’s closer to 70 days, HHS says. Trump administration officials show no signs of budging. The Associated Press asked the Office of Refugee Resettlement how the new policies square with its mission to place children as quickly as possible with relatives or other sponsors. The office did not respond directly, but in an emailed reply called the longer stays “a symptom of the larger problem, namely a broken immigration system that encourages them to make the hazardous journey”. Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School says the arrangement effectively puts prospective sponsors in an “active queue” for deportation because their case files appear prominently when Ice enforcement agents open the database. DHS privacy policy says Ice can also share the information with “appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, foreign or international government agencies”. The revelations come amid ever heightening tensions over the US’s handling of asylum seekers – and increasingly rancorous debate over immigration policy. Dozens of people rushed toward the border crossing at Tijuana and San Diego on Sunday. A handful tried breaching the border fence, and US customs agents fired teargas to stop migrants from approaching. Mexico, which deported at least 100 migrants following the incident, announced plans to expel some 500 accused of trying to “illegally” and “violently” cross the border. American authorities said on Monday that they had arrested 42 migrants on the US side of the border."
2018-07-20T14:23:05Z,Libya rejects EU plan for refugee and migrant centres,"Libya has rejected a EU plan to establish refugee and migrant processing centres in the country, adding that it would not be swayed by any financial inducements to change its decision. The formal rejection by the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, is a blow to Italy, which is regarded as being close to his Tripoli administration. In June, Italy proposed reception and identification centres in Africa as a means of resolving divisions among European governments. The impasse came as the EU said it was willing to work as a temporary crisis centre to oversee the distribution of refugees and migrants from ships landing in Europe from Libya. Italy has said it is not willing to open its ports and may even reject those rescued by the EU Sophia search and rescue mission, a position that has infuriated other EU states. Speaking to the German newspaper Bild, Serraj said: “We are absolutely opposed to Europe officially wanting us to accommodate illegal immigrants the EU does not want to take in.” He dismissed accusations that Libya’s coastguard had shot at aid workers in ships trying to rescue people from the Mediterranean. “We save hundreds of people off the coast of Libya every day – our ships are constantly on the move,” he said. In practice, Libya is already running detention camps, largely as holding pens, but they are not run as EU processing centres for asylum claims.European foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday to do more to train the Libyan coastguard by setting up the EU’s own training team inside Libya. The European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said after a trip to Niger, one of the chief funnels for people into Libya, that the EU needed to plough more money into the Sahel region to reduce the need to leave the area. He said the number of people reaching Libya from Niger was collapsing. Tajani said: “Until 2016, 90% of irregular migrants travelled through the Niger to Libya and Europe. In just two years, Niger reduced migration flows by 95%, from over 300,000 to about 10,000 in 2018.” He said he would host a European conference in Brussels in October to support democratic elections in Libya scheduled for December. At the same time, Italy is to host a further conference in Rome in September seen as a follow-on to a conference held in May by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that led to a commitment to hold elections this year."
2018-08-01T18:04:03Z,Art project listing names of dead refugees and migrants is destroyed,"An art project featuring a list of the 34,361 refugees and migrants who lost their lives trying to reach Europe has been destroyed in Liverpool. The list, which the Guardian published as a special supplement in June, was produced for World Refugee Day. It was posted on hoardings outside a building site in Liverpool’s Chinatown as part of the Liverpool Biennial art festival. On Wednesday the festival tweeted: Some people suggested a council worker may have mistaken the artwork for illegal flyposters and taken it down, but a spokesman for Liverpool city council said he had checked and was “100% sure” the list had not been removed by anyone employed by the local authority. The list was posted on the hoardings with the permission of the developers who own the site. They were trying to look at CCTV footage to see if their cameras had caught the culprit, the council spokesman said. Compiled and updated each year by United for Intercultural Action – an anti-discrimination network of more than 560 organisations across Europe – The List traces information relating to the deaths of 34,361 refugees and migrants who have lost their lives within or on the borders of Europe since 1993. In collaboration with art workers and institutions, the Istanbul-based artist Banu Cennetoğlu has produced up-to-date and translated versions of The List since 2007 using public spaces such as billboards, transport networks and newspapers. The Liverpool Biennial said in a statement: “It is timely and important to make The List public during a global refugee crisis. We were dismayed to see it had been removed on Saturday night and would like to know why. The List has been met with critical acclaim and we are doing everything we can to reinstate it.” Liverpool Biennial is the UK’s largest festival of contemporary visual art. Every two years, it commissions international artists to make and present work in the context of Liverpool in public spaces, galleries, museums and online."
2018-12-13T21:00:23Z,Coalition plans inquiry into integration and employment of refugees,"The federal government has announced an inquiry into the “integration, employment and resettlement” of refugees and humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review, to be led by Professor Peter Shergold, has broad ranging terms of reference that would allow the investigation of welfare and support services, employment requirements and work rights, and any other factor that relates to the improvement of outcomes for resettled refugees and the community. Shergold, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, has been tasked to develop recommendations to improve policy and “better ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy,” said prime minister Scott Morrison. It can invite submissions and seek information, and is expected to report back by late February. Guardian Australia understands the terms of reference allow Shergold significant freedom to examine all aspects of support services and employment issues for refugees and humanitarian migrants. “The review should seek out best practice case studies of how Australians can work together to encourage integration of refugees and humanitarian entrants in the wider community, including identifying significant barriers to success,” said one term of reference. Shergold told Guardian Australia the focus of the review was those settled in Australia as refugees, who have equivalent rights to citizenship, rather than asylum seekers. “It’s generally seen that refugees come with many skills and experiences, and refugees tend to be risk takers, entrepreneurial,” he said. “They are the group of Australians most likely to derive income from setting up family businesses. They problem is … it’s the hardest thing to do because you have to overcome language barriers, you need your overseas qualifications and experience accepted, and your first experience in the Australian labour market.” He said assisting this was something governments struggled with the most, and the JobActive employment program “isn’t working particularly well”. Shergold, who is coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW, will be joined on the review by Kerrin Benson, chief executive of Multicultural Development Australia, and Margaret Piper, the former executive director of the Refugee Council of Australia. “I think it’s important that almost from the day refugees arrive, we start to talk to them from day one, about what are their aspirations for employment … and provide them with the advice they need,” he said. “It’s no use waiting for two or three years and then talking to them.” Shergold declined to comment on recent cuts to support for asylum seekers on temporary visas, who would potentially become refugees accessing the support services the review will recommend. Last year the government began stripping services and welfare payments from a large cohort of asylum seekers currently on short term bridging visas, giving them work rights but removing housing support and other payments. The decisions, which have continued to roll out this year, have been condemned by refugee, migrant and community services sectors, who say it will force people into homelessness and poverty, and appears to have been applied arbitrarily to people including the ill and elderly, despite their lower capacity to support themselves. Earlier this month parliament passed legislation forcing another group of migrants – those on permanent skilled or family visas – to wait up to four years for some welfare support services and payments. The review was announced via press release from Morrison and the immigration minister, David Coleman. “We want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help people get jobs and integrate into the community,” Morrison said. “Having a job gives people financial independence, increases their personal connections and is one of the quickest ways to improve language skills.” Coleman said Australia had clear responsibilities in building a stronger and “more socially cohesive” society. “This review will ensure refugee and humanitarian entrants, those that have already arrived and those not yet here, are best placed to succeed and contribute to the Australian way of life.” Labor questioned the need for the review when the joint standing committee on migration had already investigated settlement outcomes for migrants, including refugees. The committee recommended the Jobactive program include employment support services specifically designed for newly arrived and longer term migrants. The government “noted” but did not accept the recommendation, saying it was already “taking steps to provide better support for newly arrived refugees”. Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, questioned the timing of the announcement. “Why is Scott Morrison trying to rush this review through the Christmas period?” Neumann said."
2018-07-13T09:00:10Z,Moscow refugee tournament throws stark light on Russia’s migrant policy,"A few hours before England’s World Cup game against Colombia in Moscow, a very different series of football matches was under way on Red Square. There was no penalty shootout drama but off the pitch the stakes for some of those involved were much higher. The five-a-side tournament, held just outside the walls of the Kremlin, pitted teams of refugees against each other, and was meant both as a celebration of diversity through football and as a message to the Kremlin over Russia’s restrictive asylum policy. Some of the players had fled conflict in Africa or the Middle East, while others were aspiring footballers from African countries who had been trafficked to Russia with the promise of a playing contract. One was Joshua Olumide, an 18-year-old from Ondo State in Nigeria, who said his father had taken out a loan to pay a man who promised him a contract with a European club. He was given a Fan ID, the document that allows visa-free travel to Russia for the duration of the World Cup, and told he would be met at the airport in Moscow. Nobody met him and another Nigerian who had also made the journey with a promise of a contract. He spent five days living in the airport and has since been living in makeshift accommodation in Russia trying to get money together for a ticket home. “It’s very sad but I am going to have to go home. My father took out a big loan to help me come here,” he said. Russians have welcomed with open arms the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have descended on the country but it is feared the effect may be only temporary and is unlikely to extend to those seeking sanctuary rather than just arriving for a few weeks of football. Svetlana Gannushkina, one of the leading Russian rights activists working with migrants and refugees, said Russia’s basic position on asylum is “nobody is given status and we pretend that refugees don’t exist”. She said only 592 people had been given refugee status in Russia in recent years. The one exception has been those fleeing the conflict in eastern Ukraine, who have a relatively easy path to either temporary residency or citizenship. For Syrians, of whom Gannushkina estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 seeking refugee status in Russia, the process is much harder: she said only two had been granted status. The tournament on Red Square was a reminder that many refugees are talented and hard-working and she hoped the “celebratory, friendly mood” of the World Cup would continue after the tournament is over. “It’s really symbolic to have these games played here,” said Piara Powar, the executive director of Fare, an umbrella organisation promoting diversity in football that helped set up the tournament. “To see these guys, some of whom have no papers, whose kids are being fed and educated by volunteer groups, playing football in the shadow of the Kremlin is quite something.” He said assurances had been sought and given by Russian authorities that the refugees would not face document checks or arrest if they came to Red Square for the tournament. Alexei Smertin, the former Chelsea and Russia midfielder, and the anti-racism inspector for Russia’s World Cup committee, played in one of the games, which took place on a five-a-side pitch set up on Red Square for the duration of the World Cup. Other games have included a match between England and Russia fans, which the Russians won 15-1."
2018-10-02T11:28:02Z,Pro-refugee Italian mayor arrested for 'aiding illegal migration',"The mayor of an Italian town that has won praise and TV publicity for integrating thousands of refugees has been placed under house arrest on suspicion of abetting illegal migration. Riace mayor Domenico Lucano – hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders – is also accused of fraudulently awarding contracts for waste disposal as well as organising “marriages of convenience” between local men and foreign women. His partner, Tesfahun Lemlem, faces the same charges and has had her residency blocked. The investigation against Lucano began more than a year ago, although more serious allegations of embezzlement and fraud were dropped. His arrest comes a week after Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, announced a series of anti-immigration measures that included slashing funds for migrant reception and integration. It also follows the suspension by the public broadcaster, Rai, of a TV show about Riace, which had been lauded as an exemplary model for integration. Salvini shared news of Lucano’s arrest on Twitter, alongside a comment that also made a dig at the anti-mafia author, Roberto Saviano, a staunch critic of his policies. “Damn, who knows what Saviano and all the other do-gooders who want to fill Italy with immigrants will say now,” the far-right League leader wrote. The Guardian was unable to reach Lucano for comment. His migrant integration project began more than a decade ago as a way to repopulate and revive the economy of the Calabrian town whose population by 2004 had dwindled to 500 from about 3,000 before the second world war. Thousands of migrants are estimated to have passed through since then, with about 500 making up today’s population of 1,500. Gioacchino Criaco, a writer from Calabria who knows Lucano well, said he foresaw the mayor’s arrest even before the investigation began. “He showed how it was possible to do concrete things with limited means,” Criaco said. “Efficiency and humanity are not welcomed in a cynical system. This is a system that only takes consensus from politics of fear. In this respect, examples of virtuousness must be eradicated.” Criaco said Lucano was an honest man but that the “rules on the reception and management of migrants are too tangled, and often administrators can find themselves caught in a dilemma between a humanitarian choice and a legal one”. Salvini has cracked down on immigration since becoming interior minister in June, closing off the sea ports and pledging to “end the gravy train” for those working in the migrant reception business. Lucano received a show of support on his Facebook page, with Riace locals calling on each other to rally together in solidarity. Sergio Bontempelli, a migrant rights campaigner with the Association of Rights and Borders, said that Riace had become too well known as an example of good integration and had been under attack for years. He said other integration projects undertaken by hundreds of people in other Italian towns were now at risk."
2018-11-29T11:00:06Z,Calling this exodus a 'migrant caravan' obscures the heart of the matter | Mark Isaacs,"When I first heard of the “migrant caravan” I thought it was a grossly inadequate way to describe this mass movement of people. The more I have learned about the movement, the more convinced I am of its inappropriateness as a definition. Thus far, I have been using it for social media purposes but I want to break down the terminology. The term “migrant” is a misnomer. It gives the impression that these people have similar situations to us. It implies they can apply for a visa, get a job and relocate their families the legal way just like an Australian might migrate to the United Kingdom for work. It is misleading to use the term migrants for a group of people who are fleeing criminal violence, authoritarian governments, corrupt security forces, economic failure and extreme poverty. It is misleading to imply that these people have the same opportunities to migrate as people from Australia, the US or other wealthy nations. While there are legal visas from Central American people to travel, live and work in the US, the likelihood of these “caravan” people – who are for the most part members of the impoverished working class – being allowed legal entry to the US is low. Their “flight risk” would be considered high and as a result they would most likely not be awarded visas or be allowed into the country. There is also the challenge of their own capability to navigate the immigration system, obtain passports, visas and flights. That’s why for many the decision to join the caravan was impulsive. They took what they saw as an opportunity when it arose, not really understanding the immigration process. Many have been learning about migration law, the asylum-seeking and refugee process, and repatriation rights on the road to the US thanks to the work of UNHCR and other such organisations. Perhaps I wouldn’t feel so strongly about this term if I hadn’t seen “migrant” used negatively before. European countries used the same language when describing the influx of refugees fleeing Syria and Afghanistan as a “migrant crisis”. Such language masked the fact that these people were running away from war zones and violence and justified European countries’ desire to refuse assistance. Many of those European countries were directly responsible for the conditions that precipitated the mass movement of people throughout the region. If US and Nato had properly stabilised and rebuilt Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US and Nato invasion, then the next decade and more of conflict in Afghanistan wouldn’t have forced so many “migrants” to the European continent. Similar geopolitical dynamics are being played out in the US currently. This is a mass exodus of people from Central American states that have been the victims of US political interventions for decades. Ongoing US intervention in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has destabilised and militarised the region, leading to an increase in people migrating to the US. Blaming immigrants for fleeing poverty and violence is a simple response to a complex problem. A better way to stem the future flow of migrants might be to re-examine US foreign policy in Central America. President Trump is happy to ignore this history, or perhaps he never learned the lessons of US foreign policy. He has been using the “migrant caravan” as a political tool, ramping up his already virulent anti-migrant rhetoric to stoke fear and suspicion of the members of the caravan and militarise the border. His manipulation of the issue shows how important language can be when talking about displaced people. The reality is that many of these people face dire threats to their life, whether that be directly due to violence or indirectly due to poverty and political instability. Many people in the caravan intend to ask for asylum when they reach the border of the United States. Many have already asked for asylum in Mexico and have been awarded refugee visas. Many people have told me that they are leaving their countries because there is no work but even then I don’t believe the term migrant is necessarily the appropriate terminology to use. In these cases, it is impossible to separate the poverty of the country from the deteriorating political situation and violence that also exists in the country. Often loss of work or inability to find employment precipitates the decision to leave a country, but often the decision to leave one’s country is multifactorial. My argument is not that none of the members of the “caravan” are migrants. My argument is that calling it a “migrant caravan” creates a blanket evaluation of all these people’s stories and allows judgment and suspicion to creep into the minds of the general public. Perhaps there needs to be a new definition for such people, one that acknowledges the dire circumstances which cause them to leave their homes. Perhaps calling them a humanitarian migrant might help.

2018-11-21T17:28:50Z,What is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe?,"More than three years after Europe’s biggest influx of migrants and refugees since the second world war, tensions between EU member states over how to handle irregular immigration from outside the bloc – mainly from the Middle East and Africa – remain high. What is the scale of migration? Numbers are sharply down from their 2015-16 peak because of a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, new border fences in the Balkans, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people are still trying to reach Europe. The UNHCR says Spain has taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea so far this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500. Overland arrivals in Greece have climbed sharply to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period last year. The underlying factors that have led to more than 1.8 million migrants coming to Europe since 2014 have not gone away; most observers believe it is only a matter of time before the number of arrivals picks up significantly once more. Why is it a problem? Everyone agrees Europe needs to urgently overhaul its asylum and immigration rules. At present Spain, Italy and Greece take most of the strain owing to their geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea and the fact that, under EU law, asylum seekers must lodge their applications in the first EU country they enter. However, no one can agree on what to do: some countries want tougher external border controls, others fairer distribution of new arrivals. Any solution will have to balance the concerns of “frontline” southern states with those of wealthier northern “destination” states, while dealing with the refusal of hardline central and eastern ones (such as Hungary and Poland) to accept any migrants at all. What is the wider political context? With anti-immigration sentiment on the rise across the continent, the presence in Italy’s government of the far-right League party of Matteo Salvini, which campaigned on a pledge to send 500,000 irregular migrants home, is making itself felt. The similarly rightwing, populist Freedom party is sharing power in Austria. In Germany – which welcomed more than 1 million migrants in 2015 under Angela Merkel’s open-door policy – the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has kept immigration firmly at the top of the political agenda. After a series of electoral setbacks, the chancellor has said she will not stand again. Polling shows immigration and terrorism remain EU citizens’ top concerns. Where do things stand? The death toll on the central Mediterranean route to Italy has fallen in the past year, but the number of those drowning as a proportion of arrivals has risen sharply to 2,054 so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Amid a string of high-profile cases of migrant rescue boats left drifting at sea, NGO vessels have all but disappeared from the main migration routes to Italy following Salvini’s announcement after taking office this summer that he was closing Italian ports to non-Italian rescue vessels. European leaders papered over their divisions at a crunch summer summit but have so far dodged any formal agreement on refugee quotas, with central states rejecting any form of mandatory action. What will happen now? Merkel is on record as saying the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, but although leaders agree on the need to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, details are scarce. Efforts will be shared, but only voluntarily. Members are to take in rescued migrants and establish centres to assess asylum claims on their soil, and the bloc will explore regional processing platforms in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. But so far none of these countries have agreed to help, while a couple have ruled themselves out. Meanwhile Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, is leading a call among some states for a “strong border” to stop an “invasion”. Nothing is yet settled."
2018-12-20T13:44:25Z,Spanish rescuers find 11 dead migrants on boat near Almería,"Spain’s maritime rescue service has found the bodies of 11 people, among them a pregnant woman, on a small boat off the country’s southern coast. The discovery came at the end of a two-day search for the migrant boat and its 55 passengers, who had gone missing about 11 miles (18km) south of the city of Almería. A spokeswoman for the rescue service told the Associated Press that a Spanish navy scientific research vessel had found the drifting boat in the area, east of the strait of Gibraltar, in the early hours of Thursday. Twenty-nine men and four women were still alive onboard, but one of the men later died in a hospital in Almería. Another 11 people remained missing. The service has also been looking for three more boats in the Alboran Sea, two of them carrying more than 55 migrants each. The Almería branch of the Spanish Red Cross called it a “sad and tragic day”, adding that the survivors and the bodies of the dead had been brought into the city’s port. According to local government officials, three young men were still under observation in hospital. Figures from the International Organization for Migration showed more than 55,200 migrants and refugees had reached Spain by sea so far this year, while 743 died in the attempt. “Already this month, more men, women and children have arrived via sea from North Africa than did in any of the year’s first four months,” the IOM said in a recent bulletin. “Migrant sea arrivals to Spain have exceeded 150 per day since 1 November. For the first third of 2018, Spain’s average was under 40 arrivals per day.” The record number of arrivals to Spain – partly driven by the closure of other European routes – has placed huge strains on the country’s migrant reception infrastructure."
2018-10-15T06:00:26Z,Hate speech has silenced the voices of those risking death on Europe's seas | Regina Catrambone,"According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), at least 1,778 people have perished this year in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the world’s deadliest migratory route. But European political leaders rarely mention this figure as they celebrate the results of their current migration policies. This is the highest percentage of fatalities ever recorded along this route. Since last year, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been represented increasingly as numbers, their ordeals under-reported or minimised, their lives used as statistics, not flesh and blood. But when the official narrative is limited to numbers and figures, people disappear. So what’s happening to vulnerable mothers and children stranded, for instance, in Libya? What about elderly people? Who is taking care of them? Are medical conditions being treated? Violence in Libya has escalated recently, further exacerbating a volatile environment that puts at stake the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people trapped amid chaos. There are a number of detention centres, the locations of which vary, where access is mostly forbidden to humanitarian organisations. The UN has often declared that working in Libya is extremely difficult and dangerous, and its staff on the ground can’t cover all humanitarian needs. Last December, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) could see at first-hand the dangers of the situation on the ground and assisted the UNHCR’s staff during an evacuation flight to Niger, where 51 children, 22 women and one man found shelter after a long stay in Libya. Nonetheless, the resettlement plan didn’t work as expected, and many people are still waiting to start their new life in another country. As migration flows intensified in 2013, public opinion showed indignation and empathy, political leaders promised to take immediate action to prevent further deaths and humanitarian organisations consolidated more efficient patterns to welcome rescued people at disembarkation ports. All eyes were focused on the survivors of desperate journeys, but the sea was still killing an unknown number of children, women and men. At that time, Moas was created to mitigate the loss of life and to allow journalists to document what it meant to be in distress out at sea. The impact of these life-saving search-and-rescues was unparalleled for three main reasons: fewer and fewer people died, journalists joined us and we gave voice to the rescued. But, our missions were not limited to rescue. We also provided post-rescue care to migrants and refugees. During their time spent on board, the people rescued didn’t receive only food, water, clothes and blankets, but also comfort and care from the Moas team. No one could say they didn’t know what was going on out at sea. Our mission helped people to share their stories – of trafficking and of hope. Now, it’s all over. Since the end of 2016, the process of dehumanisation has progressively escalated, its peak coming in 2017 when fake news and hate speech reinforced a criminalisation of solidarity. The lack of European empathy and the failure of relocation schemes profoundly changed the way we can operate, and reduced the capacity to perform rescues at sea. Almost all humanitarian boats were forced to suspend or redeploy their missions elsewhere. Merchant ships no longer perform rescues because, they say, they are afraid of being left adrift while waiting to be notified of a disembarkation port while those who survive almost fade away. The evolution of migration flows and policies has constantly silenced the voices of migrants and refugees. We have never known so little about them. Official figures are likely to be underestimates, so we don’t know how many people perish crossing the desert or the sea. We fail to help them if they end up in Libya and we neglect their lives when they step off the boat. They become invisible because we talk about them, but never talk to them, to listen to their stories. It’s easy to dehumanise people whose lives, faces and dreams are unknown. We don’t need much strength to offend and be cruel about people who are just represented by a number. Numbers don’t have feelings, scars or wounds. But behind those figures there is a person with flesh and bone, with dreams and a soul, in search of a peaceful future. Regina Catrambone is the co-founder of Migrant Offshore Aid Station, an organisation that specialises in search and rescue and has saved tens of thousands of people from the Mediterranean"
2018-12-05T22:00:13Z,"Conflicts and poverty drive big jump in global migration, finds report","Rising instances of conflict and poverty have propelled a 20% increase in the number of international migrants over the space of four years, according to a major report from the UN showing the scale of global migration. According to the UN’s International Labour Organization the total number of people who left their home country in search of work, to join family, or to flee conflicts and persecution increased to 277 million last year from 232 million in 2013. In what is the most authoritative attempt so far to chronicle the growing number of people on the move across the planet, the ILO said rising levels of inequality in many parts of the world were having a significant impact, which governments could not ignore by adopting populist policies. Manuela Tomei, the director of the ILO’s conditions of work and equality department, told the Guardian that migration was becoming a “defining feature” of the modern world and that the issues it posed could not be solved by individual nations acting alone. “The way in which migration and labour migration in particular has been dealt with until now is a recipe for disaster. There is a need to place it seriously and highly on the global agenda,” she said. The report comes as support rises for rightwing populist parties in several major economies around the world, fuelled by anti-immigrant sentiment and the hollowing out of the middle class from weak wage growth and austerity policies used after the global financial crisis. Tomei said that scapegoating migrants and imposing tougher border controls was not the answer to solving the socioeconomic and political pressures posed by rising levels of migration, adding that the ILO’s work was carried out to bring facts to a debate that often relies on perceptions and misinformation. “If you’re saying there are hordes of migrants that are invading us, and the numbers are unrelated to reality, this may trigger a syndrome of anxiety and insecurity and the response would be ‘let’s keep them out’,” she said. Some of the increase in the number of international migrants is down to a rising world population, which is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and the better quality of data used to make the ILO’s estimates. However, the organisation did single out the impact from rising inequality and a growing number of conflicts around the world, such as the war in Syria, as well as droughts and other environmental issues. Of the 277 million, 19 million are refugees, 234 million are over the age of 15, and 164 million are workers, according to the ILO estimates, with a particular rise for people moving to improve their economic life chances. Migrant workers were found to overwhelmingly move to wealthier nations, with three-fifths of all migrants concentrated in three regions: North America (23%), south and west Europe (24%) and the Arab states (14%). Arab countries had the largest percentage of migrant workers as a proportion of their overall workforce and had seen big increases in arrivals in recent years as more workers moved to work in major cities like Dubai, Riyadh and Doha, which are experiencing building booms. Across nine out of 11 regions analysed by the ILO, the percentage of migrants in work was higher than that of the local population, showing that when people move abroad they tend to do so for work, rather than other reasons. Migration due to rising inequality comes after the World Bank estimated that almost half of the world’s population – 3.4 billion people – live on less than $5.50 (£4.30) a day, and struggle to meet basic needs. Tomei said: “The widening of income inequalities within countries, and among countries, is a very, very important factor in explaining the reason why so many millions of people are moving across borders to find better working and living conditions.”"
2018-12-16T20:05:23Z,Anti-migrant protesters clash with police in Brussels,"At least 90 people have been arrested after anti-migration protesters clashed with police outside EU institutions in Brussels. Authorities fired teargas and used water cannon as around 5,500 people demonstrated against a UN migration pact signed last week in Marrakech, Morocco, at a rally organised by the Belgian far-right party Vlaams Belang. The non-binding international agreement to manage the global migration crisis has proven politically divisive in Belgium, prompting ministers from a Flemish nationalist party to quit the government last week. Authorities broke up the demonstration after firecrackers and projectiles were thrown on Sunday, according to reporters on the ground. A counter-rally, which drew around 1,000 protesters, and the anti-migration demonstration had initially been banned by Belgian authorities over fears of unrest, but the country’s supreme administrative court overturned the decision. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, was given permission to form a minority administration following the resignations of ministers from the New Flemish Alliance over the UN migration pact. The pact was agreed in July by all 193 UN members except the US, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting last Monday."
2018-10-20T17:25:39Z,Trapped at the border: the forlorn Hondurans hoping to reach the US,"Dozens of Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence abandoned their efforts to cross through Mexico to the US amid mounting fear and exhaustion, more than a week into the gruelling journey north. As many as 4,000 Hondurans, including pregnant women and children, remain trapped at the Guatemala-Mexico border awaiting permission to continue the long journey to the US. The caravan of thousands started as 160 people nine days ago but its numbers have swelled as more have joined in an attempt to leave poverty and violence behind them. Now a minority have turned back, using transport organised by Guatemalan security forces. “I’m going back because I’ve had enough, and this might be my only chance to go back safely, guarded by policemen,” said 17-year-old Byron Espina from Copán. Espina worked as a coffee picker in a small village called La Entrada, making only pennies, he said, and had hoped to find work in the US. Free buses started arriving late on Friday night, just hours after Mexican riot police had hurled teargas bombs into the frustrated crowd after some migrants broke through a riot-shield cordon to enter Mexican territory. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, said on Saturday that the caravan of people could seek asylum or enter with the right travel documents, but “irregular entry” would not be tolerated. Fearing further repression and long delays, some started boarding the buses destined for the Honduran border town Agua Caliente, where police have stopped hundreds of migrants from leaving the country to join the exodus north. The escalating intervention by security forces is seen as a direct response to threats by President Trump to cut off millions of dollars of aid to Central America and Mexico if they fail to stop the caravan – the second this year – reaching the US border. Migration is not a crime, and a regional agreement allows free movement for citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua travelling with national ID cards. The director of the Americas for Amnesty International, Erika Guevara Rosas, tweeted: “Honduran migrant caravan is not a security threat, but an act of survival by 100s of people escaping extreme violence, poverty, exclusion, and the inability of their government to protect their rights. The response to this human drama should be one of solidarity and compassion.” The migrants and refugees are mostly fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption. On Friday night at least eight people were killed during shooting in a bar in Tegucigalpa, Honduras’s capital, one of dozens of similar incidents so far this year. Fewer than one in 10 crimes are prosecuted. Honduras is the most unequal country in the region: two-thirds of people live in poverty. The bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico over the Suchiate river has become a makeshift refugee camp, with thousands of people, including entire families, forced to sleep, eat, and play outside, just metres from growing piles of rubbish. Despite the risks, most are determined to continue. “This uncertainty is part of the trip,” said Fresbindo Carvajal, 24, from Tegucigalpa, who walks with a cane due to a congenital defect in one leg. “I’m still on my way up. No doubt. It’s better to suffer for a moment than a whole lifetime. And if we go back to Honduras we’ll suffer until the day we die. Even if we have to survive on beans and coffee, I’m going.” Protests in support of migration have broken out in cities across Honduras, including outside the US embassy in Tegucigalpa where journalist and ex-congressman Bartolo Fuentes – who was illegally detained and deported from Guatemala last week while accompanying the caravan – spoke to the crowd. “I have seen mothers cry about the bodies of their children. Parents receive the coffins. I hope this stops. Meanwhile, we must accompany our fellow countrymen,” he said on Friday. Marta Sánchez, founder of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, which organises an annual caravan of mothers searching for their children who disappeared while trying to reach the US, said: “This is not a caravan, it’s an exodus. “It’s a popular uprising against the government by people who can take no more of the terrible conditions in Honduras. I’ve never seen anything like it.”"
2018-12-24T20:00:04Z,"Global migration figures higher than previously thought, study finds","Over a five-year period, about one in 80 people around the world migrate to another country, researchers have revealed, in a study that shows more than a quarter of that movement is down to people returning to their country of birth. Global migration is difficult to measure, with data often lacking for developing countries and inaccurate for others. But a pair of researchers in the US say they have come up with a model that provides the most reliable “big picture” view of human migration yet. Crucially, they say, it takes into account the “churn” of people moving into and out of countries, something previous global estimates had not included. “Policies that are set based on a quota of a number of people who enter the country miss out on the fact that you should also be expecting a lot of the existing migrant population to be leaving the country,” said Dr Jonathan Azose, a co-author of the study from the University of Washington. The study, published in the journal PNAS, reveals a model for estimating migration around the world between 1990 and 2015, broken down into five-year chunks. The team say they were able to show the model worked by comparing its results with high-quality migration data from Europe. A key problem with the previous leading global migration estimates, says Azose, is that the approach looked at overall changes in the net number of immigrants in a country over time, without taking into account that many individuals left and others arrived, resulting in underestimates of movement, something the new model tackles. It suggests that between 67 million and 87 million people, including refugees, migrated for each five-year chunk – far higher than previous global estimates of 34m-46 m migrations – and corresponding to 1.13%-1.29% of the global population. The team note that while absolute numbers of people migrating appear to have risen, there has been little change in the proportion of the world’s population who are on the move. That said, key origins and destinations change over time: for example,movement of Syrians in Saudi Arabia to Turkey between 2010 and 2015 were a leading contributor to “transit” migrations, while migration of Syrians from Syria to Turkey and Lebanon were among the largest emigration movements in that period. The new study suggests that while migration to a new country makes up the biggest proportion of human movement, return migration – in which individuals return to their country of birth – accounted for between 26% and 31% of migration in each five-year period. However, the team admit the new model has limitations, including the fact that different countries require individuals to stay there for different lengths of time to be registered as a migrant, and figures for the total number of migrants in each country might not be accurate to start with, meaning possible errors in the data used. But the team say their work could help researchers delve deeper into what causes people to migrate and help them build predictive models for this. Dr Nando Sigona, an expert in international migration and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “Estimating migration flows is extremely difficult. Data are limited and incomplete, especially in less economically developed countries. This contributes to a perception in the west that all migration flows are directed towards the global north,” he said. While the new model had limitations, he added, it offered a more rounded view of global migration, including showing movements between countries in the south and highlighting the large proportion of return journeys. “Finally,” he said, “it shows a world which is more dynamic and on the move than previously thought.”"
2019-11-30T19:00:43Z,"When refugees in Libya are being starved, Europe’s plan is working | Kenan Malik","A hospital that finds its patients so burdensome that it denies them medical care. A homeless hostel that turfs its residents out on the streets. A refugee agency that refuses to provide food for those under its care. All might seem implausible. Except that there are credible reports that the third scenario is playing out in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a body that, as its name suggests, is entrusted with the care and protection of refugees. Yet it is apparently trying to shut down a centre that it opened just last year, and to “starve out” the people still inside to force them to leave. The UNHCR’s actions, if the reports are true, are scandalous. They are also unsurprising. Starving refugees out of a place of safety is a fair metaphor for western policy towards unwanted migrants. The EU, in particular, has been adept at using suffering as a policy lever. Central to the EU’s strategy over the past decade has been the outsourcing of immigration control, paying countries from Libya to Sudan, from Niger to Turkey, to deter potential migrants to Europe. In this process a new form of imperialism is emerging, whereby rich nations, in the name of protecting their borders from migrants, trample all over the borders of poorer neighbours. Niger, on the southern edge of the Sahara, is now, in the words of one European ambassador, “the southern border of Europe”. Whereas immigration controls are usually about stopping people entering a country illegally, the new imperialism requires African nations to prevent people leaving their territory if they might be coming to Europe. It’s the 21st century’s version of the Berlin Wall slung across the African continent. What is really being outsourced, as Mali’s former presidential candidate Aminata Traoré observes, is “violence and instability”. Europe has turned migrants into commodities to be haggled over in a brutal new marketplace. It presents its policies as “a response to criminality”, a recent report on EU strategy notes, but in reality it is “fuelling predatory and criminal behaviour by generating perverse incentives in ‘partner’ countries”. The EU does not particularly care who its “partners” are, so long as they willing to stop migrants reaching the Mediterranean. Sudan’s former president, Omar al-Bashir, overthrown in a military coup this year, has been indicted by the international criminal court for war crimes in Darfur. His regime was part of the “Khartoum process”, an EU initiative to cut off the migrant route from the Horn of Africa. One of the most effective instruments in policing migrants is Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries. Until 2013 they were known as the Janjaweed, a vicious militia that pursued almost genocidal violence in Darfur. Earlier this year, the RSF was responsible for massacres against anti-government protesters in Khartoum. It also plies its trade on behalf of the EU. Nor does the EU particularly worry about whom its “partners” lock up, so long as they lock up potential migrants to Europe. In the Sahel, 80% of migration is not to Europe but is regional, involving people who for decades have moved around an area in which borders are naturally porous. Militias and security forces don’t care to sift through different kinds of migrants, so all become targets for the new kidnap and detention industry. The result is the disruption of traditional trade routes, growing economic instability and rising discontent – feeding the desire for migration. The EU turns a blind eye to the treatment of detainees, too. European governments are not just aware of the torture, sexual abuse and extortion to which detainees are subject but also, in the words of Amnesty International’s John Dalhuisen, “complicit in these abuses”. The whole point of outsourcing is to pay others to do Europe’s dirty work. The more hostile the climate for migrants in countries such as Libya or Niger, the more effective the policy of keeping migrants away from Europe. The consequences of EU migration policy should, as the charity Médecins Sans Frontières puts it, “shock the collective conscience of Europe’s citizens and elected leaders”. Yet it is barely discussed. For those hostile to immigration, it’s a price worth paying. For liberals, it’s a touchy issue, for they fear feeding hostility to the EU. For Brussels, the policy is a political success. For dictators and warlords, it’s a means to riches and power. And so, the biggest scandal of our time has become an outrage that dare not speak its name. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
2019-11-20T12:47:55Z,Greece to replace island refugee camps with 'detention centres',"Greece has announced plans to close its three largest migrant camps and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners have likened to detention centres. People living in overcrowded camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos will be moved to closed complexes for identification, relocation and deportation with a capacity of at least 5,000 people each. More than 27,000 people are currently housed on the three islands – which have a nominal capacity of just 4,500 – under conditions that have been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe. “Decongesting the islands is a priority at this stage,” said Alkiviadis Stefanis, Greece’s deputy defence minister. Smaller camps on the islands of Kos and Leros will be remodelled along similar lines and enlarged, Stefanis added. The changes come with winter approaching and hundreds of families sleeping in tents outside official facilities on the five islands. Asylum seekers will not be allowed to move freely in and out of the camps, said officials, but will instead be locked up until they are either granted refugee status and relocated to the mainland or rejected and sent back to Turkey. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum-seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. The new conservative government, which came to power in July, has already passed a law stiffening asylum requirements for migrants, and has pledged to deploy additional border patrols. Stefanis said the operations of NGO groups that assist migrants would be subject to new criteria. “Only those (NGOs) that meet the requirements will stay and continue to operate in the country,” said Stefanis. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, this week accused the EU of treating countries on the bloc’s external frontiers as convenient places to park migrants. “It cannot go on like this,” Mitsotakis told the German newspaper Handelsblatt. “Europe regards arrival countries such as Greece as a convenient parking spot for refugees and migrants. Is that European solidarity? No. I will no longer accept this.” The International Organization for Migration last month said that Greece’s mainland camps are already nearly full or past capacity."
2019-10-21T05:00:35Z,'When home won't let you stay': artwork addressing global migration,"“You only run for the border when you see the whole city running as well,” writes Warsan Shire, a Somali-British poet in her poem, Home. Another line from the poem, “When home won’t let you stay,” is the title of a new exhibition opening 23 October at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Featuring 40 artworks created by 20 key artists, When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art looks at how displacement, migration and immigration has inspired the works of artists over the past 20 years. The pieces tell some of the stories of the 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency statistic. “This isn’t a survey on the complicated topic of migration, displacement and immigration of people,” said co-curator Eva Respini. “Instead, we wanted to have a focused look through this moment right now. It’s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.” The first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It’s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled; from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes. “Over the years, I’ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,” said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. “Even though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,” she adds. The Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it’s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls “a memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee”. The Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots. Also on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016. The Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. “It tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,” said Respini. One of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. “The site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,” said Erickson. The Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003. Today, this part of the Mediterranean sea, the Strait of Gibraltar is the route to the south of Spain’s Andalusia region, which sees more migrant arrivals than anywhere else in Europe, making it especially timely. The Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra is showing works from her Almerisa series, which sees her photographing a Bosnian refugee woman over the course of 14 years, first as a child, and now as a mother. There’s also a new site-specific, community project by the Boston-based artist Anthony Romero, who collaborated with the immigrant community in east Boston. “He did a series of listening sessions, which are immigration stories,” said Erickson. “These audio recordings are a kind of community archiving for east Boston residents, story sharing.” It’s no coincidence that the museum overlooks the Boston harbor, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s a big theme that comes out of our desire to think about our museum site-specifically,” said Respini. “We’re perched on the Boston harbor, and everyone who visits us can see a dramatic view on top of the water. We’re dealing with perilous crossings over sea, a middle passage, we thought it felt right for our building, it’s so prevalent today.” When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art is on show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston from 23 October to 26 January"
2019-11-03T15:15:52Z,Outrage in Calais over death of Nigerian man in tent,"Aid groups have protested over “inhuman” conditions for migrants and refugees sleeping rough in Calais after a 25-year-old Nigerian man died from smoke inhalation in his tent. He had tried to light a fire in a tin to keep warm and prepare food. Police in Pas-de-Calais confirmed that a man had died from intoxication from smoke fumes at the end of last week and said an autopsy would take place. The man was the third migrant or refugee to die in Calais this year. Aid groups reacted angrily and joined leftwing opposition parties in protesting against a recent decree by the rightwing mayor of Calais aimed at stopping migrants from gathering in the town centre during cultural festivities planned for this month. Charities said the decree had limited their ability to distribute food to migrants and refugees sleeping rough. “This death is really symbolic at a time where the local authorities have sought to remove migrants as well as the volunteers who help them from the town centre for supposed reasons of public order,” said François Guennoc of the aid group l’Auberge des Migrants. The decree was signed in part to coincide with a Calais street festival this weekend. Several political parties including the Greens, the Socialist party and France Unbowed said it denied migrants “their humanity and labels them as parasites that have to be hidden or walled in”. Since the closure of a makeshift migrant camp in Calais in October 2016, hundreds of people have been sleeping rough along the coast in squalid conditions, many without proper access to sanitation. Charities estimate that between 400 and 500 migrants and refugees are currently in Calais hoping to cross to the UK. The majority are from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan Antoine Nehr, a coordinator for Utopia 56, which helps migrants and refugees in Calais, said conditions were “disgraceful and inhuman”. “People are being kept in such precarious conditions that unfortunately result in too many deaths,” he said."
2019-12-29T17:11:15Z,Most Britons weren’t hostile to migrants | Letters,"Kavita Puri, like so many others before her, talks about the racism faced by immigrant communities when they first arrived in large numbers during the 1960s (They came from south Asia to help build Britain. The racism they saw then is back, 20 December). This does great injustice to the vast majority of British people who went out of their way to help the new migrants to settle. They volunteered to teach English, teachers paid extra attention to immigrant children, health service staff treated the frail and elderly with utmost compassion. As an example, the city of Leicester accommodated tens of thousands of people fleeing Uganda. The Conservative government of Ted Heath did a remarkable job in settling those expelled from Idi Amin’s regime. Employers took in the new arrivals with little grasp of English and let them flourish. A huge number of people from the Indian subcontinent and east Africa ventured into business and prospered. The new generation born in this country have achieved beyond anyone’s imagination. They have broken many glass ceilings. Yes, you will occasionally get abuse thrown at you or there will be disagreeable people in all walks of life, but how can that be representative of the whole country? On the other hand, minorities can also have faults, and it remains their responsibility to join the mainstream. They have to respect the ethos and nuances of the people of the country they find themselves living in. While not denying that there were, and are, issues, the narrative that total hostility prevails does not stand up to scrutiny. Nitin Mehta Croydon, London • It is certainly worthwhile for fans to take a lead on football racism (Letters, 27 December), but if we are serious about getting rid of racism, it is far too late in people’s lives and much more difficult to do this. Racism does not come out of nowhere. Research over 50 years shows it is learned at an early age, long before children go to school. So in our deeply entrenched racist society, unless what surrounds children is positive about taking action to counter this racism, it is likely that they will reflect this. Much of our media, society and education system deny and even ridicule this. Consequently, little is done until it is far too late, when long-held attitudes are much more difficult to unlearn. In football, on the streets and in political discourse, such racism festers. Unless we face the facts about the early age that racism is learned, we’ll continue to have pleas for someone to do something about it when it rears its ugly head.

2019-10-23T18:21:26Z,Essex lorry deaths: how dangerous is the journey to the UK?,"Where did the 39 people who were found dead in a lorry container come from? We don’t know yet. Police were clear on Wednesday that they were some way from identifying them or confirming their point of origin. The only detail they provided of the victims initially was that 38 were adults and one was a teenager. Throughout the day, information emerged that might provide clues as to where the victims were picked up. Initially police thought that the container had come to the UK via Holyhead on Saturday and said: “We believe the lorry is from Bulgaria.” But later the force said it now believed that the trailer had travelled from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, while the cab had come from Northern Ireland separately. The Bulgarian government said that the lorry was registered in the coastal city of Varna under the name of a female Irish citizen. While it was not clear that either the cabin or the trailer had begun their journey there, the hypothesis that the victims travelled along the Balkan migrant route remained a possibility. Where does Bulgaria sit on the Balkan migrant route? Every day, hundreds of asylum seekers from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran attempt the cross the Balkan route to reach western Europe. The majority of them arrive in Bulgaria, having travelled through Turkey. From there, they try to cross Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, hoping to reach Slovenia, a Schengen country, before heading on to Italy, Austria or Germany. What are conditions like in the Balkans? Migrants often face brutal beatings within Balkan countries and as they cross borders. Setting off in groups, they attempt to cross under cover of night, trying to avoid police, armed with truncheons, pistols and night-vision goggles. If captured, migrants are often illegally pushed back, only to try again the next day. Informal camps are dotted along the Balkan borders, such as the one in Bihać in Bosnia, where migrants sleep in tents or under plastic and cardboard for a few nights. Migrants who have experienced the camps run by the Bulgarian government say asylum seekers are repeatedly abused and assaulted by the police. Since eastern European countries, such as Hungary, have closed their borders, crossings have become increasingly hazardous for migrants. Often, the only way to continue the journey is on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers. What are the recent developments? Last month, the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, drew attention to a significant rise in illegal crossings. Borissov said that on 20 September, 440 migrants had been detained after crossing the Turkish border by 11am alone. Greece is dealing with a similar situation. Meanwhile, local authorities in Bosnia have temporarily cut the water supply in Vucjak camp, near the city of Bihać, to force the central government to relocate migrants and refugees living there. Police have also removed dozens of asylum seekers from trains to prevent them from reaching camps that are overcapacity in the north-west of the country. Thousands of migrants are stuck near the border with Croatia, an EU member state. The Bihać Red Cross has warned of a building humanitarian crisis. How many people have died in transit? Since 2014 the International Organization for Migration has recorded the number of people who have died in transit. In the past six years, figures show more than 33,700 deaths. This figure is considered indicative of the human cost of unsafe migration but is likely to underreport the actual number of people who have died or gone missing during migration. More than 1.9 million migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN. A total of 92 migrant deaths were recorded on land in Europe in 2018, and before Wednesday’s discovery of 39 bodies inside a Bulgarian-registered lorry in Essex, 58 deaths had been recorded for 2019, 22 of which were from “vehicle-related” incidents. Five people have drowned in the Channel this year, and a man who stowed away on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. A further 24 people have died on the western Balkans route so far this year: eight deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina, six in Serbia, five in Croatia, three in North Macedonia and two in Slovenia. There were 41 deaths in 2018."
2019-12-04T15:46:58Z,Grenade thrown at migrant children's centre in Madrid,"Bomb squad officers in Madrid have carried out a controlled explosion after a practice hand grenade was thrown over the wall of a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors in the north-east of the Spanish capital. A spokeswoman at the Madrid headquarters of the national police force said the grenade carried a small amount of explosive. There were no reported injuries. “Staff at the centre found a suspicious object in the centre’s patio between 8.30 and 9 this morning,” she said. “Specialist officers from the national police force attended and evacuated the children to a safe area. Bomb squad officers detonated the object, which was determined to be a practice grenade with little charge, which had been thrown into the centre’s grounds in a bag from outside.” The reception centre, in the Hortaleza neighbourhood, recently made headlines after it was singled out by Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party. Abascal, who lives in Hortaleza, said the centre and its residents – many of whom are from north and sub-Saharan Africa – had left many local people feeling unsafe. “I live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood – Hortaleza,” he said during an election debate last month. “And every time I’m on the street – and there’s a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors there – I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.” Unaccompanied foreign minors – known by the Spanish acronym menas –were also targeted by Rocío Monasterio, Vox’s leader in Madrid, who called them “a serious problem in our neighbourhoods”. Wednesday’s attack was not the first time that children at the centre have been targeted. In the fortnight before the election, on 10 November, some of them were beaten with oars and clubs. Adriana Lastra, the vice-secretary general of the ruling Socialist party, said that words had consequences. “This is what hate speech brings,” she wrote on Twitter. “It needs to be fought online, on the streets and in our institutions.” Vox also condemned the attack. But in a statement, it accused its opponents of trying to make political capital out of Wednesday’s events. “It’s disgraceful that violence – which is never justified – should be used for political ends,” it said. “We await the conclusions of the investigation by state security forces.”"
2019-10-23T17:08:48Z,Lorry horror highlights risks migrants take to try to reach UK,"The discovery of 39 people dead in the back of a lorry in Essex has renewed focus on the risks taken by undocumented migrants to travel to the UK to seek safety and shelter. A lack of safe and legal routes into the UK is in part driving a dependence on life-threatening methods including squeezing into the back of refrigerated lorries or riding in vulnerable dinghies across wild seas. People fleeing the threat of torture, rape or death cannot claim asylum in the UK without physically reaching Britain, aside from a few limited programmes including the Syrian refugee resettlement programme. Family reunion routes – that is, those granted refugee status in the UK being able to apply to bring relatives to join them – have been drastically curtailed. The UK gave protection – grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave and resettlement – to 18,519 people in the year ending June 2019, according to the most recently available figures. However, it is relatively hard to secure asylum in the UK, which hosts less than 1% of the world’s refugees. Furthermore, the hostile environment policy, including the UK’s use of immigration detention (it is one of the only countries in the world where the period of detention is not capped), is likely to have deterred some people from wanting to seek asylum at all for fear they will end up in purgatory. The Dublin regulation, an EU law which states that an individual is eligible to be given asylum only in the first safe country they arrive in, encouraged people with good reasons for wanting to travel to the UK – for example, good command of the language – to attempt to do so by dangerous backdoor routes, often facilitated by ruthless people smugglers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “Nobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy, which has deliberately shut down safe and legal routes to the UK. “We need more than empty expressions of sadness and shock from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson. We need a commitment to opening safe and legal routes to the UK and quick decisions for people seeking to make a better life for themselves in the UK. People move – they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their life to do so.” The National Crime Agency has responsibility for tackling what it calls organised immigration crime. This stands apart from modern slavery and human trafficking because it involves consent on the part of the individual travelling, while the latter involves coerced movement across borders. However, there is an obvious overlap and the incident in Essex could be either of the two. A range of methods are used in organised immigration crime, including clandestine entry from near Europe, air-facilitated migration, use of false or fraudulently obtained documents and abuse of legitimate entry and leave to remain. In 2018 new migrant camps emerged in the Grande-Synthe and Puythouck Lake areas near Dunkirk, where organised crime gangs are known to be active, recruiting migrants for onward movement to the UK. Juxtaposed border controls remain the main targets for clandestine entry into the UK. These controls are part of an arrangement between the UK, France and Belgium whereby immigration checks on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding a train or ferry, rather than on arrival. In 2018 the number of Eritreans detected at juxtaposed controls increased notably, with Eritrean nationals found concealed in refrigerated lorries and containers, probably indicating growing levels of organisation. The Guardian understands that last year more than 35,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented at the UK’s juxtaposed controls in northern France and Belgium. During the same 12-month period, more than 8,000 people were detected in the UK, either at ports of entry or having entered the country illegally on a vehicle. The top 10 nationalities of undocumented people found at juxtaposed controls in 2018 were Eritrean, Iraqi, Afghan, Iranian, Albanian, Sudanese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Syrian and Ethiopian. What could be done in the UK to reduce the chance of individuals attempting such risky journeys? Refugee and asylum seeker rights campaigners have been calling for an extension to refugee family reunion rules to include a wider definition of family, allowing individuals safely based in the UK to bring family members to join them. There have also been calls for the resettlement programme for Syrian refugees, which is run by the UN refugee agency, to be extended to other countries. • This article was amended on 24 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Syrian refugee settlement programme as the only one which operates without the person reaching Britain. The Syrian programme is one of a small number of limited refugee resettlement schemes."
2019-12-05T14:37:45Z,Pope's aide takes 33 refugees to Rome after visit to 'shameful' Lesbos camp,"An aide to Pope Francis has urged Catholic churches across Europe to open their doors to refugees after bringing 33 people to Rome from overcrowded, squalid camps on the Greek island of Lesbos. Speaking on his return from a visit to the camps, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Vatican’s almoner, condemned the EU’s handling of the refugee situation, saying that “animals live better in Europe”. The 33 refugees, among them families from Cameroon, Afghanistan and Togo, arrived in Rome on Wednesday night and will be hosted by the Vatican and the Sant’Egidio charity. “We have the money, let’s begin with ourselves … let’s open our rectories, convents and monasteries to at least one family each from the Lesbos refugee camps so that we can empty them all,” Krajewski said after landing at Fiumicino airport, in Rome, with the group from Lesbos. “I have seen terrible situations in the camps.” The population in the island’s camps has increased from 7,000 in May to more than 15,000, of whom 800 are unaccompanied children, Krajewski said. “There is no hope for them stuck in Greece, where they are living in dramatic conditions. This is a problem for Europe and is shameful.” The Vatican’s latest “human corridor” mission from Lesbos was implemented following the approval of Greek authorities and the Italian interior ministry. Pope Francis, who has likened migrant facilities on Lesbos to “concentration camps”, brought back 12 Syrian families after visiting the island in 2016. They were temporarily housed by the Vatican before being helped to integrate into society by Sant’Egidio. Ten more people will be transferred to Italy from Lesbos by the end of the year. Greece has been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe over the conditions in refugee camps across its islands. On Thursday a fire broke out in a container housing a family of five Afghans in the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos, killing a 27-year-old woman. Other camp residents managed to safely evacuate the children – an infant, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. The children’s mother was found dead after the fire was extinguished. Their father suffered smoke inhalation. A fire broke out at the crowded Moria camp in Lesbos in September killing a woman from Afghanistan and triggering clashes between refugees and police. The facility has been hit by several fires since the EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants, with a woman and child dying in a blaze that year. In November Greece’s centre-right government, which came to power in July, announced plans to close the three largest migrant camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners compared to detention centres. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. It has also passed a law tightening asylum requirements and pledged to increase border controls. Krajewski was named almoner, a job that Pope Francis transformed into a hands-on charitable mission, in 2013. He has worked discreetly, for the most part, for the poor for years. However, in May this year he made headlines after climbing down a manhole and breaking a seal to restore electricity to a building in Rome where 250 homeless people were living. The move prompted an angry reaction from the far-right politician Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister."
2019-11-19T22:13:52Z,Dozens of migrants found in refrigerated container on ferry,"Dutch authorities have discovered 25 migrants stowed away inside a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for England. According to a statement published on a local government website, all those found onboard were alive, with one of them thought to be a child. The ferry, Britannia Seaways, run by DFDS Seaways, had left the port in Vlaardingen bound for Felixstowe, Suffolk but returned immediately after discovering the people on board. The ship was met by 20 ambulances, and two of the migrants were taken to hospital to be checked for hypothermia. The other 23 received a medical check-up in the port before being processed by police, according to a statement from emergency services. The origins of the migrants are currently unknown, but reports suggest most of them are male. Mirjam Boers, a spokeswoman for Rotterdam police, told the broadcaster RTL that all migrants found on the ship were undergoing checks by emergency responders, but could not comment on the severity of their conditions. “The highest priority is to check how they’re doing medically … This is about human lives and the main thing is that they’re all okay”, she said. She could not confirm whether a child was amongs those found on the ship. Police also told the Dutch broadcaster NOS that the driver of the lorry had been detained and was being questioned about possible human trafficking offences. A DFDS spokesperson said the crew found the people hiding inside a refrigerated container and alerted the police, who arrived on the boat while it was still at sea. The spokesperson said the container was normally locked and sealed, but the stowaways had made a hole in the trailer door. Asked about the security of the containers, the spokesperson told the Guardian security was “very tight” but the incident would be reviewed. “We have surveillance and regular checks of the trailers. It’s a mystery to us. We have good cooperation with authorities at all of our ports, but we have to realise that sometimes migrants do succeed in getting through,” they said. According to the Dutch newspaper AD, police had to search the ferry for more than an hour to find the correct container. The incident follows the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex last month. All of the 39 people who died were Vietnamese nationals, who had travelled inside a refrigerated container from Zeebrugge in Belgium."
2019-12-20T12:41:27Z,"EU headquarters built by undocumented migrants, workers claim","The EU is facing embarrassment over claims that its new Europa headquarters, also known as the Space Egg building, was built with the help of undocumented migrant workers who at times went without pay. The European council building in Brussels, which contains an ovoid glass structure, was opened in 2016 at a cost of £300m. At its unveiling it was said to symbolise all that is best about the union. But EU officials are now facing claims from the Belgian newspaper De Standaard about the business practice of subcontractors who worked on the project. One subcontractor, known as Group Diamond Services, which was subsequently declared bankrupt in 2015, was investigated by prosecutors after claims by Bulgarian workers, the paper reports. The men claimed to have gone without pay. The investigation was closed in October because of insufficient evidence, but De Standaard found that in reality the file had been lost by prosecutors at some point in the four years since the inquiry started. The paper carries interviews with some of the workers, including Beyhan Dzhelilov, 43, who was the head of a team of eight iron casters on the Europa building project. He told the paper: “Several team members did not have Belgian residence papers. None of us got a contract, we were not insured.” The main companies, Interbuild and Jan De Nul, who won the tender for construction of the Europa building, told De Standaard they were unaware of any exploitation of workers by subcontractors. A spokesman for Jan De Nul told the paper that GDS was taken off the project early as the company “did not comply with contractual planning and technically did not perform the work correctly”. The spokesman added: “Every employee from all subcontractors was checked for possession of the necessary documents. This also applied to the employees of subcontractors who acted on behalf of a subcontractor or a sub-subcontractor. “Only after this preliminary inspection did the approved employees of subcontractors gain access to the site. For that they received a personal badge with passport photo. The yard was completely closed off from the area and only had two access gates with a badge system. Unauthorised persons could not enter the yard.” The Council of the European Union has been contacted for comment. An EU official working at the council said the Belgian state was the prime contractor for the Europa building. He added: “The Council itself has not been informed by the Régie des bâtiments [the building regulations office] of any issues related to the working conditions of their contractors or sub-contractors “All building and maintenance contracts undertaken directly by the Council are in line with the Belgian labor legislation.”"

2019-08-19T15:50:52Z,Greek NGO helping child refugees wins $2m humanitarian prize,"An NGO helping migrant and refugee children in Greece has won the world’s biggest annual humanitarian award. METAdrasi – Action for Migration and Development received the $2m (£1.6m) Hilton humanitarian prize for its “innovative approach to welcoming refugees and protecting unaccompanied minors”, the Conrad N Hilton Foundation said. Peter Laugharn, the foundation’s president and CEO, told the Guardian: “METAdrasi … demonstrates the power of individuals to make a marked difference in the lives of migrants and refugees in Greece.” Laugharn praised METAdrasi’s pursuit of common-sense solutions, including engaging translators “fluent in over 43 languages and dialects to help navigate extremely complicated policies and procedures”. The frontline organisation was founded in 2009 with the aim of safeguarding the rights of people displaced by war or persecution. From the outset it placed particular emphasis on minors who had reached Greece alone either because they had lost or been separated from parents along the way. The NGO has a permanent presence at all key entry points to Greece and acts as a safety net for unaccompanied children, transporting them from detention centres to suitable accommodation, finding guardians and placing them in foster care or in conditions of supported independent living. It employs 350 interpreters and has helped more than 12,000 minors. METAdrasi’s founder, Lora Pappa, said of the award: “It will enable us to strengthen our advocacy and help us be heard. This is an ongoing crisis. We are so grateful to receive the prize at a time when urgent needs regarding the refugee situation continue to emerge.” The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates there are 80,000 people stranded in Greece, including 4,100 unaccompanied children. The number of arrivals has dropped dramatically since 2016 when the EU struck a deal with Turkey but they are on the rise again. On Lesbos, the eastern Aegean isle once at the centre of the crisis, 9,000 people are detained in a camp meant to house a third of that number. This month, Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, raised the prospect of as many as 35,000 people a day crossing into Europe if Ankara were to turn a blind eye and open the floodgates. “I’m not threatening Europe, I am just pointing something out,” he warned, claiming that the EU had failed to deliver on its promise to give Turkey agreed funds under the 2016 accord."
2019-12-19T11:49:08Z,Boy found alone on M6 motorway after arriving in UK,"A boy believed to be a 15-year-old from Iraq has been found alone on a motorway near Birmingham after allegedly entering the UK illegally. Police officers responding to reports of a pedestrian on the M6 took him into emergency care on Wednesday night and he was subsequently transferred to the care of local social services. West Midlands police contacted the Home Office’s immigration enforcement division shortly after finding him. Using an interpreter, he told of how he had come to the UK, that he was 15 years old, from Iraq, and did not know where his parents were. It is thought he entered the UK recently. “He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn’t know which country they’re in,” the central motorway police group said. “It’s impossible to imagine how scared someone would be, not knowing where they are, not knowing where their parents are, unable to speak the language. “We’ve taken him to a place of safety with food and water until social services can come and take him to care.” West Midlands police said a driver reported seeing the boy walking on the central reservation towards junction 7, the Great Barr interchange – which is about five miles away from West Bromwich – at 10pm on Wednesday. “He was picked up by a police patrol car and taken into emergency care for the night,” a spokesperson said. “It’s understood the male is from Iraq and the matter has been passed to immigration.” Fizza Qureshi, co-chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, said she could not imagine how the boy was feeling and called on the government to make it easier for people to seek “refuge and protection” in the UK to prevent deaths of people in transit. “We are extremely concerned to hear of this story,” she said. “We cannot begin to imagine how he is feeling, in unfamiliar surroundings, alone and without his family, not knowing what might happen next. “This boy’s journey of being separated from his parents and family, and being alone, would be similar to those of other unaccompanied minors who have come to the UK because no safe routes exist for people to come to the country for refuge and protection. We must create these routes to prevent any further tragedies.” Liz Clegg, from the Meena Centre in Birmingham, which supports child refugees, told the BBC that reuniting children separated from their parents in such circumstances was a “huge challenge”. She hoped “the system in place would kick in quickly” and that she expected authorities and charities would be working to trace his family. Lucy Leon, from the Children’s Society, said he now faced a drawn-out and legally complex situation, and urged for him to be provided with an independent guardian to represent his interests. “We think it is vital he should also be given an independent legal guardian to represent his best interests, ensure his voice is heard, and that he understands the complex immigration process he is about to embark on,” she said. Only children suspected of being victims of trafficking are given independent legal guardians in England and Wales, but in Scotland and Northern Ireland the “vital support” is given to all unaccompanied refugee and migrant children, she added. “It’s incredibly important he’s got a guardian, someone who’s independent, not part of the local authority, not part of the Home Office, who can really support him through that complex legal process,” she said. “Quite often we see in our work young people slipping through the net and not being identified as a victim of trafficking and exploitation, or even at risk.” Iraq was the second most common country of nationality for people applying for asylum in the UK last year. There were 2,700 applicants, 43% of whom were granted protection, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. The Home Office said the boy’s case would be dealt with according to the immigration rules. In October, 39 Vietnamese nationals, including 10 teenagers, were found dead in a lorry in Essex, leading the foreign affairs select committee to declare that the UK’s policy of closing borders drives migrants into smugglers’ hands."
2019-12-04T06:00:43Z,The 'qualifications passport' scheme breaking down barriers for migrants,"The armed rebels had first ransacked the hospital where Timothée* worked as a doctor. Then, they went door to door with machetes, hunting down those seen as the wealthiest – the most educated first. When the house next door was burned down with his neighbours still inside, Timothée fled. Without a chance to grab his passport or phone, Timothée ran through the darkness of the bush of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, knowing he might never see his family or his fiancee again. When he reached a refugee settlement in Meheba, Zambia, in September, Timothée had no proof of his previous life. But now he has a little more hope about the future. In Zambia, a pilot qualifications passport scheme is being run by the government and the UN agency Unesco to help refugees access jobs or further education in the country by informally verifying their qualifications when they do not have crucial paperwork. A joint Unesco/UNHCR report found that fewer than 15% of migrants in developed countries say their level of education matches their jobs. In developing countries one in eight immigrants say that having their qualifications recognised is their greatest challenge in settling into new lives, more so than language, discrimination or even visa restrictions. Of the 60 who applied from his camp, Timothée was among 11 who reached the required standard. Summarising the holder’s qualifications, experience and language skills, as well as any paperwork available, the qualifications passport is designed to help translate a refugee’s qualifications to those in the host country. The scheme is due to be extended to Iraq and Colombia next year. Timothée feels his years of study and medical practice have at last been recognised. “The day I heard my qualifications had been accepted, I was so happy. I thanked God. It’s a way for me to get my identity back,” he says. Last week, Unesco member states adopted a new convention for “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory recognition” of higher education qualifications. Audrey Azoulay, Unesco’s director general, says it is in everyone’s interests to create a “simple mechanism”. “For governments, there is a clear fiscal argument against the squandering of human capital.” Timothée has managed to let his family know where he is via Facebook on a borrowed phone. He has not yet been able to speak to his fiancee but has established through a friend that she is safe. He hopes he might move to a French-speaking country as it would be easier for him to practise medicine there. France would be nice, but he needs travel documents. He knows there are no guarantees yet, but is hopeful. “Doors are opening for me again”, he says. * Surname withheld on request."
2019-08-25T12:46:19Z,"Nearly 900,000 asylum seekers living in limbo in EU, figures show","Close to 900,000 asylum seekers in the EU are waiting to have their claims processed, according to figures from the European statistics office. Women, men and unaccompanied children are living for years in uncertainty, with numbers of pending applications for international protection almost unchanged from two years ago when 1.1 million migrants were “stuck” in the continent. “Living in limbo is now the norm for those seeking protection,” said Karl Kopp of Pro Asyl, Germany’s largest pro-immigration advocacy organisation. “Limbo means living in the miserable Greek EU hotspots, or being trapped and pushed back at the borders. It means living in the desperate search for protection and human dignity.” Eurostat figures have revealed a backlog of 878,600 requests at the end of 2018, with Germany having the largest share of pending requests (44%), ahead of Italy (12%). The figure comes despite the number of migrant arrivals in Europe practically halving in the last two years. Factors leading to the continuing backlog include new laws from right-leaning governments and an increase in the number of rejections, leading to lengthy appeals processes. “The vision of governments on the migration crisis has changed and more and more countries are rejecting an increasing number of requests for asylum,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo. The rejection rate for asylum requests in Europe has almost doubled in three years, from 37% in 2016 to 64% in 2019. In Italy, rejections were at 80% at the start of 2019, up from 60% the previous year as the populist government also removed key forms of protection. The German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has in 2019 rejected three-quarters of family reunification requests from Greece, where migrants live in the overcrowded camps of Athens and Lesbos. “If a migrant has his asylum request rejected, in any case, he is entitled to have recourse to appeal, which, however, lengthens the time waiting in limbo by up to four years,” said Vassallo. “There are migrants who arrived in 2015 and had their asylum requests denied. At that point they presented an appeal to a court and are still waiting for an answer on their future.” Experts point out how some governments in recent years, especially in Italy and Germany, have accelerated evaluation procedures for asylum requests, which appears to have caused an increase in rejections because high-speed procedures are not carried out with as much thoughtful evaluation. “The agenda of the rightwing extremists is now the agenda of the mainstream and all that matters is high speed, few or no rights in the procedure, highest possible rejection rates and increasing the deportation figures,” said Kopp. “Many rejected asylum seekers receive protection only through a legal action but years of waiting for the court decision extend the limbo situation in an intolerable way.” According to Eurostat, since 2014 there have been 3.6m requests for asylum in EU countries, only 1.8m of which have resulted in legal protection. Those who stay after rejection are at risk of suddenly becoming illegal immigrants. “This is the worrying part of this phenomenon, with thousands of people exposed to the risk of a difficult life, at the mercy of labour exploitation,” said Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Italy. According to Eurostat, Germany reported the highest number of illegal migrants in 2018, with 134,100. France was second with 105,900. But Italy, where hardline measures are likely to keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants, could soon far exceed them. Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the Italian thinktank the Institute for International Political Studies, said that based on analysis of figures from the interior ministry, “there could be more than 700,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy by 2020”."
2019-09-04T17:21:55Z,Matteo Salvini replaced by migration specialist in new Italy coalition,"A career civil servant and specialist in migration policy has succeeded the far-right leader Matteo Salvini as Italy’s interior minister in a new left-leaning pro-European coalition government aimed at drawing a line under a crisis sparked by Salvini’s populist League party. Luciana Lamorgese, a veteran of the interior ministry, has in recent years been in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy and is known for promoting integration events and policies. She was also the first female security chief, or prefect, of Milan. Her appointment should mark a break from the era of Salvini, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers. The coalition assembled by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) also includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister. The new government is expected to be sworn in on Thursday. During the coalition negotiations, the PD repeatedly asked the M5S to abandon the migration policies of the previous government, in which it was in coalition with the League. The key was the abolition of a Salvini-drafted security decree that provided for the seizure of NGO rescue boats and fines for vessels that brought migrants to Italy without permission. Dozens of captains of rescue boats and volunteers subsequently ended up under investigation, with at least eight in the last three months. Prosecutors in Ragusa on Tuesday placed the German captain and the mission chief of the Eleonore rescue ship, operated by the NGO Mission Lifeline, under investigation on suspicion of encouraging illegal immigration. The captain had declared a state of emergency onboard and defied the entry ban, landing more than 100 migrants in Pozzallo, Sicily. Last week Italian officials handed a €300,000 (£270,000) fine to the Mare Jonio, operated by the Italian NGO Mediterranea, which saved more than 100 migrants, including 22 children under the age of 10. Although the number of migrant arrivals in Europe has practically halved in the last two years, hundreds of asylum seekers continue to attempt the crossing from north Africa. Last week, at least two known shipwrecks were registered, according to aid groups, with a total of almost 70 people drowned, while at least two boats have been completely lost. In recent weeks, NGO vessels have saved more than 600 people in total. A French passenger ferry headed to Marseilles from Algiers on Monday rescued 18 people off the Balearic Islands. Campaigners and aid groups hope that, with the new government and above all with the new minister of the interior, Italian policy on the migration crisis can finally change. Graziano Delrio, the PD leader in the lower house, said on Wednesday that a new immigration law has been included in the new government’s political agenda. Carlotta Sami, a spokesperson for the UNHCR in Italy, said: “There is a humanitarian crisis for which everyone must feel responsible: the search and rescue at sea and the common management, at European level, of landings. “There is a chance to carry out inclusion policies towards refugees, policies that consider them a resource and not a problem. There is a lot to do, but we hope Rome will resume the central and crucial role it deserves in these issues.’’ On Tuesday M5S members overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the PD in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes. “This turning point is good. Now it’s time to change Italy,” said the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti. “We have stopped Salvini and the mere announcement of this phase is making Italy a protagonist again in Europe.” Salvini, who pulled the plug on Conte’s last government on 8 August seeking snap elections he hoped would boost his party, described the new pro-European coalition as “a government born between Paris and Berlin and from the fear of leaving their posts, without dignity and without ideals, with the wrong people in the wrong place. “They won’t be able to dodge the judgment of the Italians for too long. We’re ready … in the end it is us who will win.” The new ministers will face confidence votes starting on Monday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches."
2020-09-12T07:36:58Z,UK urged to take in refugees after fire at Lesbos migrant camp,"Pressure is mounting on the UK government to take in some of the thousands of asylum seekers left without shelter following a devastating fire at Europe’s largest migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. The blaze tore through the Moria registration and identification centre (RIC) overnight on Tuesday, incinerating tents that had been home to 13,000 people, including at least 4,000 children. Germany and France are to take in children hit by the fire but the UK has yet to offer any assistance. Since last October, the Greek government has been appealing for help from other countries to take in asylum-seeking children from its islands; 13 countries, including non-EU states Norway and Switzerland, have taken part but the UK has refused to help. The fire has made the situation on Lesbos even more critical. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, urged the government to act. He said: “The government should live up to our responsibilities and promises as a country and look to work with international partners so we can immediately offer sanctuary and home to some of the unaccompanied children in this terrible situation.” More than 70 civil society organisations have signed a call for action urging governments to take in people displaced by the Moria camp fire. Stephanie Pope, EU and UN policy and advocacy manager at Refugee Rights Europe, said: “While we are shocked and saddened by the horrific images of Moria burning, they come as no surprise. The devastating fires are yet another reminder of the tragic human cost of a European asylum and migration system based on containment and deterrence policies. “Thousands of individuals, including roughly 4,000 children, have been left homeless and traumatised. We urge all European governments including the UK, to uphold their commitment to human rights and show solidarity with these individuals, by relocating a number of them to safety without delay.” Ruth Tanner, the head of Oxfam’s humanitarian campaigns, said: “The ongoing humanitarian tragedy in the camp and now this devastating fire are an urgent reminder to the UK government that it should be doing its fair share for people fleeing conflict and persecution. “The UK’s resettlement operations, which were paused due to the pandemic, should be urgently restarted. The UK government needs to provide adequate safe and legal routes for refugees to reach the UK and allow more refugee families to be reunited in safety here.” In a letter to the home secretary, Lord Dubs, who was a child refugee himself, said: “The situation in Greece is an international emergency and it requires international cooperation to find a solution. As a leading nation on the world stage, I hope the UK will play its role in making sure that children are relocated from this horrendous situation as soon as possible.” In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed byDubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The process was subsequently referred to as the Dubs scheme. The government capped the Dubs scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this. The cap has been met so the scheme has in effect ended; however, the legislation remains and the government could take more children under the scheme if it chose to do so. The tragedy underlines the importance of establishing a credible replacement for European laws – known as the Dublin regulation – which govern family reunion for unaccompanied minors who have relatives in the UK, campaigners say. When the transition period ends on 31 December, so will the UK’s obligations under the Dublin regulation. The UK also suspended its global resettlement scheme, designed to transfer recognised refugees from an another country, due to the pandemic and has yet to restart it. Refugees International advocate Daphne Panayotatos, said: “The devastation caused by the fires in Moria has only underscored what the world already knew about the indignity, unsustainability and danger of holding people in the miserable conditions in Lesbos. “The UK and other European countries have taken only minimal steps in response to Greece’s requests for assistance. By keeping resettlement operations on hold, the UK has further abdicated its responsibility to people seeking safety in Europe. With tens of thousands in Lesbos now left with nowhere to go, the UK should immediately step up to take in more vulnerable asylum seekers, resume resettlement, and facilitate family reunification.”"
2020-09-10T17:00:09Z,EU official says asylum policy impasse 'part of the problem' at Moria,"A senior EU official has said Europe’s failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy was partly responsible for the “unacceptable” conditions at the Moria camp on Lesbos that burned to the ground this week, leaving more than 12,000 people without shelter. Ylva Johansson, the European commissioner for home affairs, said that when she took office in December 2019, the situation for 40,000 refugees and migrants living on Greek islands was “unsustainable and unacceptable”. Asked whether Moria – long notorious for overcrowded, filthy conditions – was a result of the commission’s past actions, she said: “Migrant camps on Greek soil are primarily the responsibility of the Greek government.” She added: “The failure [of] the previous commission to actually reach a common European migration and asylum policy is also part of the problem.” Speaking to the Guardian and other European newspapers, Johansson said: “We sometimes say that Europe does not have a migration crisis, and we don’t have that right now. But some migrants are in crisis and that has been the situation in some of these camps.” Following the disastrous fire at Moria, the European commission has promised to fund the transfer of 400 lone children to the Greek mainland, and it is sending a ferry to shelter the most vulnerable people. Johansson highlighted the commission’s actions, working with Athens, to reduce the number of refugees and migrants on the Greek islands, saying the population of Moria had been reduced by almost half in six months: “We were not sitting on our butt to wait for this to happen.” The Swedish social democrat has been charged with drawing up new migration and asylum rules in an effort to heal the open wound over who takes responsibility for people arriving at Europe’s southern borders. The long-delayed migration and asylum pact due on 30 September will propose how frontline countries such as Greece, Italy and Malta can be better helped by their EU neighbours in managing large numbers of arrivals. Johansson declined to confirm whether that meant a legally binding obligation on EU countries to take in refugees – an idea behind some of Europe’s most bitter divisions. She said the problems at Moria were caused “not only” by failure to agree a relocation policy, but also by the absence of swift processes to assess asylum claims and effective means to return people rejected for refugee status to their country of origin. In 2019 the average asylum seeker in Greece could expect to wait nearly 11 months to get an interview to assess their claim after declaring their intention to seek refugee status, according to the Greek Council for Refugees. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, the EU pushed through compulsory refugee quotas in the face of opposition from some central European countries, which flatly refused to shelter asylum seekers. An attempt to reform the system in 2016, based on the idea of mandatory solidarity payments by refusenik countries, foundered. The commissioner, a former employment and integration minister, also said she would like EU monitoring to prevent illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at the EU border. In May, the Guardian found that Malta was using private companies to intercept migrant boats and return potential asylum seekers to Libya. Amid escalating tensions with Turkey, the Greek government was reported by the New York Times to have set up a “black site” where migrants were held without legal recourse before being pushed back into Turkey. “I am very concerned about reports of pushbacks,” Johansson said. “For me it is a fundamental right to have a right to apply for asylum … and that’s why I am considering introducing a monitoring mechanism in the pact to make sure that people have this right at the borders.” She did not give details on how that mechanism might work. The migration pact is expected to intensify EU efforts to return failed asylum seekers to their country of origin, as well as proposing legal routes for people seeking to work in Europe. The EU will also put more attention on taking refugees from non-EU countries via resettlement programmes. The ideas will only come into force with the consent of EU governments. Despite low expectations, Johansson said she was optimistic about finding a compromise on this “very, very difficult exercise”, citing the agreement on the coronavirus recovery plan that had sharply divided member states. “But I guess when I present my pact, nobody would be happy,” she added."
2020-10-20T12:12:38Z,Greece extends wall on Turkish border as refugee row deepens,"Greece has begun extending a border wall along its frontier with Turkey to deter migrants from trying to enter the European Union, the Greek government has said, after a border standoff earlier this year which has helped drive Greek-Turkish relations to a dangerously low ebb. A total of 16 miles (26km) of wall will be added to the existing 6 mile fence along the Evros River, which forms much of the Greek-Turkish border, the government spokesperson Stelios Petsas said on Monday. The €63m (£57.5m) extension will add 5 metre-high fencing and upgrade the existing sections of the wall by using galvanized square steel tubes and concrete foundations, Petsas said. The work is due to be completed in April. Turkey hosts around 4 million refugees, mostly from Syria. It often threatens to reopen the migrant route from the Middle East, which at its peak in 2015 resulted in thousands of people drowning in the Mediterranean Sea and about 1 million people reaching Greece and Italy where many still live in crowded displacement camps. In February this year, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe, in an attempt to pressure its western allies into supporting a Turkish military campaign in Syria’s Idlib province. As a result, tens of thousands of refugees and migrants living in Turkey attempted to cross by land and sea to Greece and Bulgaria in March, although the movement was quickly halted by the outbreak of coronavirus. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 7,357 people crossed from Turkey into Greece in the first quarter of 2020 - only slightly higher than the figures recorded in the same period of the previous year, although deaths at sea increased from 19 to 67 people. The standoff, however, has still led to tougher border control tactics. Turkey has accused Greece of illegally pushing back migrants reaching its islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, a charge Athens denies, while Greece says Turkey sends patrol vessels to escort migrant boats into its waters. Greek police told the Associated Press they had started trialling high-powered mobile sirens aimed at deterring migrants as they attempted to cross from Turkey, and an upgraded surveillance camera network is also planned to cover the entire 120 mile Greek-Turkish border. “The cameras will be a vital resource for us,” said Ilias Akidis, the head of the police officers’ association in the Greek border region. “We have been asking for them for five years and we think they will be very effective.” The plight of refugees and migrants has been steadily weaponised by Turkish and Greek politicians over the last five years. Relations between the two countries, frosty at the best of times, have fallen into a deepening crisis in recent months. Disagreements over Cyprus, refugee flows and oil and gas drilling rights in the Mediterranean have drawn in other countries in the region, and for the first time in decades prompted fears of direct clashes between the two Nato allies."
2020-12-23T16:16:50Z,Fire destroys migrant camp in Bosnia,"A fast-moving fire has destroyed a migrant camp in Bosnia strongly criticised by rights groups as inadequate due to its lack of resources. The blaze broke out at the Lipa camp, close to the border with Croatia, on the same day the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had declared the effective closure of the facility, saying Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to supply basic services. Thick black smoke could be seen rising as residents, mainly from the Middle East, south Asia and north Africa, fled in panic. A UN official said the blaze was believed to have been started by migrants unhappy at the camp’s temporary closure. “As far as we know now, a group of former residents put three tents and containers on fire after most of the migrants had left the camp,” said Peter Van der Auweraert of the IOM. He said to his knowledge there were no casualties. The IOM has urged Bosnian authorities to make the camp fit for winter and offer an alternative shelter option while the work is being conducted. Hundreds of migrants, including children, are now left without shelter as temperatures in Bosnia are expected to go as low as -4C. Bosnia has become a bottleneck for thousands of migrants hoping to reach the EU. Most are concentrated in the country’s north-western Bosanska Krajina region as other regions in the ethnically divided nation refuse to accept them. From there they attempt to cross the border with Croatia into the EU, and contend with pushbacks. Bosnian authorities ordered the transfer of thousands of migrants to the remote temporary camp in March at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. A few weeks ago, when temperatures fell to -6C, more than 1,400 people were still living in the camp. The shower and toilet facilities had frozen and people were forced to use the surrounding woods to relieve themselves. The EU has warned Bosnia that thousands of migrants face a freezing winter without shelter, and urged the country’s political authorities to set aside their differences and take action. But others believe that behind the incident in Lipa a deep political rift is developing between the UN and the EU, and the Bosnian authorities. Attempts to reopen another camp, Bira, in the Bihać region have run into opposition after it was closed at the end of September by the Una-Sana canton authorities. “What is happening in Bihać is a political crisis that has been brewing for nearly two years,” said Paola Lucchesi, a former journalist based in Bihać and president of the NGO Centar za Odrzivi Razvoj “Una”. “In the last two months, a standoff between the cantonal and municipal authorities and the IOM, that acts as an operational partner for the EU commission, has escalated to the point of a full-blown constitutional crisis within the country,” she added."
2020-12-22T10:30:13Z,Alarm at  Colombia plan to exclude migrants from coronavirus vaccine,"Colombia will refuse to administer coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan refugees within its borders, President Iván Duque has announced, in a move which stunned public health experts and prompted condemnation from humanitarian groups. Speaking to a local radio station on Monday, Duque that only Venezuelans with dual nationality or formal migratory status will have access to the vaccine when it is eventually distributed in the country. According to migration authorities, Colombia currently houses 1.7 million Venezuelans who have fled political repression, economic ruin and widespread food and medicine shortages. Only about 45% have formal status, and hundreds more cross the border unofficially every day. Duque said the controversial decision was taken to prioritize Colombians, and to prevent a rush on the border. “Imagine what we would live through,” he told Blu Radio on Monday morning. “We would have calls to stampede the border as everyone crosses asking for a vaccine.” But the comments prompted an immediate backlash. “Now is the time to show solidarity; vaccinating migrants and refugees costs less than their hospitalization in an intensive care unit,” said Juan Viloria, a Venezuelan doctor in Colombia and the coordinator of Coalition for Venezuela, a migrant rights group. “Not doing so puts thousands at risk, particularly those most vulnerable who do not have anywhere to isolate, wash their hands, or socially distance,” Viloria added. Meanwhile, Colombia faces a resurgent coronavirus outbreak, with cases climbing by over 10,000 a day following months of respite. Lockdowns and other restrictions over the Christmas period have been put in place by local mayors. “Not vaccinating Venezuelans is a bad idea from an epidemiological point of view,” tweeted Alejandro Gaviria, a public intellectual and the dean of Los Andes University in Bogotá. “But it is above all an unethical proposal: it excludes the most vulnerable and discriminates in an almost threatening way against a group of people because of their nationality and immigration status.” Colombia signed deals with the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca last Friday to provide 20m doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Duque said at the time that rollout would begin “in the first weeks of 2021”. Andrés Cubillos-Novella, a professor of public health specializing in migration at the Javeriana University in Bogotá, warned that not vaccinating migrants and refugees would create broader problems for Colombia’s health response. “Many vulnerable migrants live among vulnerable Colombians, and much of that population will be put at risk: access to the vaccine is a question of human rights,” Cubillos-Novella said, adding that the government’s decision may have been made due to financial restraints. “Perhaps that is where international aid could step in.” The Colombian president’s announcement also flies in the face of advice from international organisations which have warned against leaving migrants and refugees behind in vaccination campaigns. “This decision is not ethical or effective,” said Marianne Menjivar, Colombia director for the International Rescue Committee. “We can’t beat Covid anywhere until we beat it everywhere, among all populations, especially those most vulnerable.”"
2020-10-27T20:10:07Z,Hostile rhetoric will not stop refugee children dying in the Channel,"After the death of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler pictured washed up on a Turkish beach, many promises and commitments were made by global leaders to step up their response to the migrant crisis. But today, five years on, we are facing an identical tragedy, and much closer to the UK’s doorstep, raising the question: did Kurdi’s death change anything?’ A five-year-old and an eight-year-old died after falling into the Channel when the boat in which they were travelling, in an attempt to reach the UK, capsized. It is the worst tragedy of its kind in the Channel. Taking such a risk with one’s life, or children’s lives, will be beyond most people’s understanding. The conditions on Tuesday were particularly poor for a crossing, with rain and strong winds – most attempts are taken on calm, clear days. The reasons people risk such a dangerous journey are numerous. They are frequently fleeing torture or death in their home countries. The conditions in northern France are poor and worsening, despite the help many charities offer, with frequent raids on migrant camps, and poor access to healthcare, basic supplies, and legal assistance. Migrants and refugees are often running towards the comfort of family, hoping to be reunited with loved ones in the UK. Humanitarian groups, and some of Britain’s biggest cultural stars, are united in their belief that individuals will continue to want to travel to the UK for a wide variety of reasons. They say it is crucial that the UK government offers safe and legal routes for people to travel to the UK to claim asylum, as migrants cannot claim unless they are on British soil. There are few safe and legal routes. Refugee groups say family reunion rules protected by EU law, known as the Dublin III regulations, are the most effective. But when the transition period ends on 31 December, the UK will no longer offer this route and the EU has dismissed alternatives offered by the UK as “not very operational”. Last week, the government rejected a Lords’ amendment to its immigration bill that would ensure the provisions of the Dublin regulations would continue. Other “safe and legal routes” have been suggested by humanitarian groups and migration experts, none of which is being utilised by the UK government. In 2016, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Alf Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The government capped the scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this and, as the cap has been met, the scheme has, in effect, ended. In October last year, Greece’s immigration minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, asked fellow EU states to help. He wanted countries to take in some of the 4,000-plus unaccompanied children on Greek islands. The European commission ultimately responded and funded a scheme to transfer children off the Greek islands. So far more than 10 countries, including Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the EU, have taken part. But the UK has refused to help. Instead, ministers have taken a hardline approach, vowing to make the crossing “unviable”. The UK government has appointed “a clandestine channel threat commander” to tackle people smuggling and is investigating methods of physically blocking asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel. Ministers and officials have looked at using nets to disable boat engines, locking up migrants on oil rigs, sending them more than 5,000 miles away to Ascension Island in the south Atlantic, and using water cannon to create waves to push back vessels. This is set against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the government directed at asylum seekers, and those who wish to help them. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has called the asylum system “fundamentally broken” and promised new laws to deny asylum to those using illegal routes to enter the UK. All of which has caused dismay among humanitarian organisations, which do not doubt that migrants fleeing from dire circumstances will continue to take risks to reach the UK."
2020-11-30T13:17:49Z,Spain dismantles 'deplorable' migrant camp in Gran Canaria,"Spanish authorities on the island of Gran Canaria have emptied and begun dismantling the much-criticised dockside camp that was used to house thousands of migrants and refugees, as the Canary Islands continue to struggle with a huge rise in migration. The makeshift camp was set up in the town of Arguineguín in August amid a surge in the number of people making the dangerous Atlantic journey from Africa to Europe. So far this year, about 20,000 people have arrived by sea in the Canary Islands – 8,000 of them in November alone. The large volume of people put the archipelago’s reception infrastructure under severe strain and had left the Arguineguín camp accommodating up to 2,600 people in cramped and unsanitary conditions. On Friday, Spain’s public ombudsman called for the camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people’s basic rights. A judge described conditions in the camp as “deplorable”, while Human Rights Watch said they were “pretty awful”. Ángel Victor Torres, the regional president of the Canaries, announced that the “unsustainable” camp had been emptied on Sunday and was being taken down. The people accommodated there were moved to a new a camp in a former military base and to tourist hotels. “I celebrate [the dismantling], but there’s a lot left to do,” Torres wrote on Twitter. “It’s very important that we make sure these people who have risked their lives on the dangerous Atlantic crossing receive dignified and humane treatment. There also need to be controls in their countries of origin, and we need to fight the mafias and speed up transfers and repatriations.” The presence of the migrants and refugees had angered some residents, but Torres called for people on the archipelago to think about the islands’ own long history of migration, adding: “There’s no room for racism in the Canaries.” The mayor of Mogán, the municipality of which Arguineguín is part, said local people’s patience was running out and that the central government needed to move the 6,000 migrants and refugees who are currently being put up in hotels before the end of the year. Txema Santana, of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid, welcomed the closing of the camp but said much more needed to be done. “EU islands can’t only be a reception area where there are thousands of places [for migrants and refugees],” he said on Monday. “The plan for the Canaries will fail unless it includes quick, transparent and regular transfers to the Spanish mainland.” Earlier this month, Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the camp and spoke to some people who had been housed on the dock for more than two weeks. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland,” she told the Guardian. “Those are two very clear solutions.” According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. Eight people died last week when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries."
2020-09-13T17:09:23Z,Greece pledges migrants made homeless will be resettled within days,"Greece has pledged that migrants made homeless after devastating fires at Europe’s biggest refugee camp will be rehoused on the island “within days” in defiance of fierce opposition from locals. The country’s migration minister Notis Mitarachi said the process of resettling more than 12,500 men, women and children forced to flee the facility in Lesbos was well under way even if the coronavirus pandemic meant it was also taking longer. “It will take a few days but all the affected people will be moved into this temporary location behind me,” he told reporters at the site where authorities, with the aid of the army, have been racing to set up tents. “We hope to have 5,000 beds ready by the end of the day.” Rapid Covid-19 tests were being conducted before anyone entered to ensure it remained “a safe community”, Mitarachi said. Erected in a former firing range within view of the sea, the replacement camp is the government’s answer to the humanitarian emergency that exploded last week after fires erupted in the now-gutted holding centre in Moria. A series of blazes, starting on Tuesday, decimated the notoriously overcrowded facility forcing thousands of people into the surrounding countryside. In the chaos that ensued refugees have slept rough, many in makeshift shelters along the side of a stretch of road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital, under heavy police guard. Others had sought refuge in olive groves, churches, supermarket parking lots and even a local cemetery, as authorities and aid groups struggled to bring in water and food. The prospect of being relocated to a new site has been welcomed neither by the refugees, nor locals. Lesbos, which faces Turkey, has long been on the frontline of refugee arrivals. Close to a million displaced Syrians landed on its shores in dinghies and rickety boats at the height of the country’s civil war when Europe’s migrant crisis peaked. For migrants forced to endure lengthy waits for requests to be processed, the Aegean isle is not the promised land envisaged when they embarked on the often perilous journey to Europe. On Sunday, a day after riot police fired teargas at protesters, many refused to enter the new site for fear they would never leave. Mitarachi insisted that those remaining outside would not be transferred to the mainland. “The best solution for them to move on with asylum applications is in the camp,” he said, claiming the centre-right government’s migration policies were “tough but fair”. Fears of a surge in coronavirus cases has, say authorities, made it ever more vital that people living at the camp are found and tested. Prior to the infernos, 35 of Moria’s residents had been diagnosed with the virus, with the Greek migration minister telling reporters “there might be 200 cases … by now”. In Thessaloniki the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said the combination of the pandemic and the migration crisis had made for “an explosive mix” and blamed the fires on “overactive asylum seekers” hoping Moria’s destruction would see them being moved to Athens. But he also voiced optimism that the end of a facility long deplored by human rights groups for its appalling conditions could mark the beginning of a new era for Europe in its often bungled handling of the issue. “I want to believe that this tragedy is a warning bell for all,” he said, adding that, whatever happened, a new camp would be built on Lesbos with the help of Europe. “I’ve requested that the EU be involved in the management of the new centre wherever it is [on the island]. I’d like to see the flag of Greece and Europe flying from masts at it.” Athens has long complained that, aside from funds, it has received little solidarity from the 27-member bloc. “We can’t fail a second time as Europe in handling the migrant crisis,” Mitsotakis said."
2020-04-22T03:40:23Z,Migrants stranded in Queenstown as New Zealand lockdown sparks 'refugee crisis',"Thousands of migrants are stranded in the resort capital of Queenstown, unable to get home and unable to earn a living during the coronavirus lockdown. New Zealand has been in level-four lockdown for a month, meaning no one can leave their homes except to fetch essential supplies, or for a brief respite of exercise. According to the Salvation Army, most migrants in Queenstown are employed in the hospitality and restaurant sectors, and many live in overcrowded conditions, including boarding houses where relationships are under strain. Though wage subsidies have been available for some migrants, depending on their visa and employment conditions, others have been ineligible for government assistance and a record 5,000 people have applied for emergency help, including food and accommodation assistance. With most migrants unable to return to their home countries due to travel and lockdown restrictions, the situation is becoming akin to a “refugee crisis” the Salvation Army said – with about 6,000 people needing urgent help. The Salvation Army has experienced a 600% surge in demand for its services during lockdown. “We’re seeing week on week more extreme and more complicated measures of difficulty. It started off with ‘I have no money for food’, but it’s moving into ‘I have no money for rent, my power, firewood, winter clothing’ and the list just gets longer and longer,” said Lieutenant Andrew Wilson from the Salvation Army. “Many migrants cannot return home, either because their country is in total lockdown or they do not have the resources to pay for flights.” “We’ve had one case where the individual was made redundant two weeks before the level-four lockdown. They had booked flights to return to their home country but their flight was cancelled at the last minute. They are now stuck here with no means of returning home but is still required to pay for rent and outgoings.” Immigration New Zealand is involved in assisting some migrants, and the Salvation Army said it had the ability to “make sure these people don’t go hungry” but larger costs such as getting home, rent and bills were of major concern. Language barriers had also been “a significant issue”, and a number of families now had police and social services involved after lockdown domestic violence incidents, with some families having to be split up for safety reasons. Anu Kaolti from the Migrant Workers Association described the situation as a “powder keg”, and said there was great frustration among migrants that they couldn’t get government help – or get home. “We have been inundated with contact from migrants confused and looking for help,” said Kaloti, adding that many migrants were fired at the beginning of the lockdown. “It’s really dire and desperate circumstances that are beyond anyone’s control. People are still holding it together but the pressures are there, I don’t know how much longer they’ll be able to hold on.” Queenstown was looking at a minimum of a one-year economic downturn, with tourist numbers set to plummet as bans on foreign arrivals are in place. The goal now was to get as many migrants returned to their home countries as possible. Wilson said: “The best-case scenario is for the migrants to return home, or into alternative employment somewhere else in the country, but that’s still a long way off.” Queenstown District Lakes mayor Jim Boult has described the situation as an “unprecedented welfare crisis” and said he expected the 5,000 applications for welfare assistance to rise. “It’s almost too big to comprehend,” Boult told the local paper. “I have been speaking regularly with central government to emphasise the importance of supporting our migrant workers, who will be essential to our ultimate recovery and the future diversification of our economy.” Around the country food banks and welfare services say they are experiencing demand that they would usually only see around Christmas, and many families were surviving on basic foods such as baked beans and porridge."
2020-09-23T17:01:10Z,EU’s migration proposals draw anger on left and leave questions unanswered,"The EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, hopes migration will become just another “normal policy area”, even “boring”. Since more than 1 million refugees arrived in Europe in 2015, migration has been neither “boring” nor easy for the bloc. Leaders have flung accusations at each other, exposing painful divisions. In 2015, Italy’s then prime minister told his fellow leaders they were “time wasters”, who didn’t deserve to call themselves Europeans. Central European countries accused their neighbours of trying to “blackmail” them. The latest proposals are intended to fix a system senior EU officials admit is broken. The Moria camp that sheltered asylum seekers in squalid conditions before it burned to the ground was described as “a stark reminder” that the old system no longer works, by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. While not the “entirely new architecture” billed, the new proposals mark a break with the past. The EU executive has abandoned the idea of mandatory refugee quotas that proved so toxic in 2015, but insists countries cannot do nothing. Governments that refuse refugees and asylum seekers can instead opt to return people denied asylum to their country of origin, an idea described as “return sponsorship”. For the left and some liberals, this compromise is evidence of an authoritarian drift. “The far right has captured EU migration policy,” said Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in’t Veld, although she also praised the commission for its attempt to end years of deadlock, adding that “failure is not an option”. The European People’s party - the centre-right group of Von der Leyen - described the plans as “a good starting point”. Governments on both sides of the asylum debate are holding fire as they digest the plans spread over five draft regulations and other official texts Viktor Orbán’s chief spokesperson did not reveal if the Hungarian government was ready to be a “return sponsor” - brokering deals with Middle Eastern and African countries to take back their nationals – in a statement that put more stress in discouraging migrants to leave their homelands in the first place. However one of Orbán’s MEPs, Balázs Hidvéghi, told BBC Radio 4 that “we are ready to take part in what is called return sponsorship”. If true, that could be a significant step. But Orbán’s government is likely to object to the idea that any migrant not returned to their country of origin after eight months would come to live in the EU member state that had taken charge of their return. On the other side of the migration divide, Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, described the plans as an “important step towards a truly EU migration policy”, but cautioned that “assurance on returns and relocation is needed”. Italy could have problems, as the controversial rule that countries of arrival take default responsibility for migrants is largely intact – although there would be more scope for other EU member states to take over. And there are many open questions. The EU executive wants a monitoring mechanism to investigate widely reported illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at Europe’s borders. But that system would be set up by EU member states, namely, the same countries accused of perpetrating violent abuses. Brussels also wants all new arrivals in the EU to undergo health and security screening at the border within five days – an exacting demand on frontline states, such as Italy and Greece with notoriously slow processes, at a time when the EU migration budget has been slashed. Legislators fear the model will simply be creating “more Morias” with people stuck in closed camps in southern Europe. “This pact risks making the model of Greek hotspots a blueprint for all border countries in the EU,” said Erik Marquardt, a German Green MEP, who has been in Lesbos since the Moria fire. These troubling questions and many more are meant to be resolved in nine months: the commission has called on EU ministers and MEPs to agree the legislation by June 2021. If the timing sounds like a tall order, the retreat on refugee quotas may unlock a compromise. But the EU migration debate is unlikely to become “boring” any time soon."
2020-10-24T17:46:27Z,Government reduces minimum salary for migrants to settle in UK,"The government has quietly reduced the £35,800 minimum salary for migrants to settle in the UK by almost 30%, it has emerged. Migrants on salaries of £20,480 but with enough points under Boris Johnson’s new Australian-style immigration system to qualify for jobs where there is a shortage of workers will also be entitled to settle after six years and become citizens. The rules, which come into force on 1 December, were published on Thursday by the Home Office, with the general threshold lowered to £25,600 as the government tacitly acknowledged the essential contribution that lower paid migrant workers make to the UK. Amnesty International UK said it was troubled by the way immigration rules, including salary thresholds, “have long exaggerated the privilege of people already advantaged by their relative wealth, gender and race”. Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “Sadly, this latest development does not appear to signal any new or firm commitment to encourage equality of opportunity through the UK’s immigration system or to respect the rights and human dignity of all women, men and children regardless of class or colour.” However, Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for tighter immigration control, said the move would reduce the incentive for employers to train British workers. The £35,800 salary threshold was introduced in 2011 by Theresa May when she was home secretary as part of the effort to meet targets on restricting net migration set by David Cameron, which the government was never able to achieve. Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, which identified the change in the 507-page rulebook, said it was “the final nail in the coffin of the net migration target”. Deputy director Rob McNeill told the Daily Telegraph: “They are acknowledging that the bluntest of all the instruments the government used to get to that target of tens of thousands has been kicked into touch.” Before the 2019 general election in December, Johnson reprised the core message of Vote Leave’s 2016 EU referendum campaign and said that EU migrants have been able to “treat the UK as if it’s part of their own country” for too long. He guaranteed that migration would fall under his plans after the UK left the EU as he sought to appeal to undecided Eurosceptic voters in Labour marginals. The Home Office did not comment."

The idea that politicians like Boris Johnson and Priti Patel offer “thoughts and prayers” to grieving families while simultaneously limiting routes for asylum is hypocritical and sickening; they have built their political careers by exploiting people’s xenophobia and fear of others.

2020-09-12T16:45:49Z,Greek riot police fire teargas at refugees campaigning to leave Lesbos,"Greek riot police fired teargas at protesting refugees clamouring to leave Lesbos as the situation on the island became more explosive days after devastating fires forced thousands to flee its notorious migrant camp. Tensions mounted as asylum seekers, desperate to make their way to other parts of Europe, watched authorities, including the Greek army, rush to replace the now gutted facility of Moria with a new holding centre. “Freedom, freedom,” demonstrators chanted under the watchful eye of riot police deployed to the Aegean isle from Athens. “We don’t need new camp … we want freedom,” proclaimed some of the crude handwritten placards held aloft by protesters on Saturday. Witnesses reported teargas being fired after younger migrants began lobbing rocks at the police units. A series of overnight blazes starting on Tuesday razed Moria, Europe’s largest refugee camp, decanting close to 13,000 men, women and children into the surrounding countryside. With the exception of 406 lone migrant children who have been flown to the Greek mainland, the former residents have been left to fend for themselves, many making makeshift shelters out of tarps and bamboo reeds along the side of a main road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital. Others have camped in fields, olive groves, churches and even cemeteries. Frustration, the insistence of Greek officials that transferal is out of the question and a growing realisation that any prospect of leaving is diminishing fast have helped create an increasingly toxic atmosphere. The destruction of containers housing the asylum service in Moria has further fuelled a prevailing sense of desperation among refugees. “The thought that they may be here for even longer now, the sight of the replacement camp and being stranded without proper shelter for days has, for many, become the tipping point,” said one aid worker requesting anonymity because she was not authorised to speak. Earlier, Greece’s alternate migration minister, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, told SKAI TV Lesbos was facing a public health emergency, “a triple challenge” that also involves “public order and national security”. He expressed “certainty” that the blazes, which erupted in quick succession and appeared to be coordinated, were the result of arson although as yet no one has been arrested and no concrete evidence offered. Suggestions that rightwing vigilantes may be behind the infernos have also been made. The fires broke out within hours of authorities announcing further lockdown measures in the facility after health officials said they had detected dozens of coronavirus cases in Moria. None of those diagnosed with the virus have yet been found, according to Greek officials. On Saturday a woman and her 20-month-old baby were flown to Athens where they will be hospitalised after testing positive for the virus. They were not among the original group, most of whom were described as asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19. With fears of infection rates increasing, some 200,000 Covid-19 rapid tests were flown into Lesbos on a specially chartered plane on Friday. “There are now real fears among our island’s residents of the virus spreading,” local journalist Yannis Sinanis told the Guardian. Officials were working around-the-clock to erect the new settlement, a collection of 500 tents with the capacity to accommodate six people each. Other asylum seekers are expected to be accommodated in a ferryboat and naval ships. The Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachis, coordinating relief efforts on the island, said every refugee would be tested before entering the temporary site. “We believe that within the day we will start taking people in,” he told reporters in televised comments streamlined by the ministry in Athens. “Already the first families are settled here. Food, water, medical supplies, shelter, safety are the priorities of the day.” Greece, like Lesbos, may be on the frontline of migratory flows from war-torn countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa but the refugee problem was an issue that affected the entire continent he said, thanking EU countries for weighing in with aid in the wake of the fires. “We expect from all our European partners to contribute to an issue that is not Greek,” Mitarachis added. “It is European.”"
2020-12-23T07:15:38Z,'Black book' of thousands of illegal migrant pushbacks presented to EU,"A 1,500-page “black book” documenting hundreds of illegal pushbacks against asylum seekers by authorities on Europe’s external borders was released last week and handed over to the EU commission. Compiled by the watchdog organisation Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN), the Black Book of Pushbacks is a collection of 892 group testimonies, detailing the experiences of 12,654 victims of human rights violations along the Balkan migration route, one of the most gruelling in the recent migrant crisis given the alleged violence of border police officers. Every day, thousands of people, mainly from south Asia, the Middle East and north Africa, attempt to cross the Balkans to reach Europe. It is an arduous journey with virtually no welcoming facilities for migrants, who are forced to spend most of the trip in makeshift camps or in train stations. For years, charities have denounced the abuses, particularly in Croatia, as asylum seekers are systematically beaten, robbed and pushed back. Between January and November 2020, the Danish Refugee Council recorded 15,672 pushbacks from Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina, with more than 60% of these reportedly violent. “This book – which brings together four years of work – points to a gaping hole in accountability for perpetrating authorities, including member states and EU agencies, like Frontex,” Simon Campbell, field coordinator for BVMN, told the Guardian. “The testimonies, committed here to paper, represent a definitive archive of evidence, detailing systematic violations against people on the move, such as breaches of international law on asylum and returns, as well as the prohibition of torture.” More than 15 organisations have contributed to the book, which contains maps, data, photos and other key information and was made in collaboration with the United Left block of the European parliament. Last Friday, Malin Björk, a member of the parliament’s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs and Miguel Urbàn, co-founder of Spanish political party Podemos, presented and handed over the Black Book to the EU commissioner for asylum, Ylva Johansson, in Brussels. Speaking about the launch of the Black Book, German MEP Cornelia Ernst said: “We have been so shocked by endless accounts of merciless, sadistic and degrading violence – reminiscent of brutal dictatorships. The Black Book sheds some much-needed light on this dark chapter of the EU. Our hope is that it will contribute to bringing an end to these crimes and holding the governments that are responsible accountable.” “Although these accusations are met with denial from the perpetrating countries, what we provide within these pages is an analysis of patterns and photo evidence that reveal an ongoing, systematic practice,” said Hope Barker, spokesperson for BVMN. “And these are just the stories that the network has managed to record. The reality is much wider and more far-reaching. “We call for an end to impunity and a renewed commitment to accountability, both of which will work towards ending such brutal human rights violations,” she said. In Bosnia-Herzegovina about 1,200 migrants and asylum-seekers are living in squalid conditions in the Lipa tented camp in Una-Sana canton, a site unsuitable for winter. The International Organization for Migration said it would close the camp as Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to help supply basic services. Thousands of migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon face an impossible choice: fend for themselves in abandoned buildings and squats, or attempt to cross the border into Croatia and the EU – in the hope of escaping the violence of border police."
2020-10-17T17:54:40Z,Refugee supporters hold 'welcome event' for asylum seekers in Kent,"More than 200 people gathered outside a former military barracks housing asylum seekers near Folkestone, to counter rising far-right activity against migrants. Tensions rose around midday as police stopped a dozen far-right protesters from targeting the event by encircling refugee supporters. After the welcome meeting, around 50 counter-protesters marched, with some brandishing St George’s and union flags and chanting racist messages. “The vast majority of people are supportive of migrants, but we don’t always hear their voice, we hear the voice of a very vocal, significant minority,” said Bridget Chapman, from the Kent Refugee Action Network. The area has seen a rise in violent incidents recently and a small number of residents is said to meet by the site every weekend to harass asylum seekers. “There are groups of far-right vigilantes who are claiming to send back migrant boats,” said Richard, a volunteer with Channel Rescue who preferred not to give his surname. Dozens of asylum seekers have been placed in quarantine in one of the redbrick blocks after one person tested positive for coronavirus. It comes after repeated warnings were given over the cramped and unsanitary conditions at the site. The Guardian understands the man who tested positive, an Iranian asylum seeker, is no longer on site and has been taken to hospital. Kay Marsh, who works for the migrant charity Samphire, believes the deteriorating economy is fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment. “The government has managed to convince populations that there is a foreign enemy: you’ve got no money, no job, that’s because of foreigners. And people believe it because they need someone to blame,” she said. “It’s scary to think that your own government has got it out for you.” Inside the barracks, a group of men waved back at the crowd, clapping and shouting: “Thank you!” On one of the building’s doorsteps, a young man was seen holding up a sign reading “we love you”. Among those supporting asylum seekers was Ross Emans, 43, who came with his son. “This is the first time I’ve been involved with a demonstration to support migrants,” he said, holding a sign that read: “Welcome.” “I used Google to translate “welcome” to Arabic. Hopefully, it’s correct! “The migrants have been demonised and dehumanised on the internet by far-right groups. They are treated as if they are just one. Some people refer to them like they are animals when they are human beings and each of them has their own story. It really concerns me and I can understand why they are leaving their countries.” He added that he was getting a DBS check to be able to volunteer with charity Care for Calais. The charity, based in northern France, tweeted out praise for the supporters. “We are so grateful to everyone who attended the welcome event at Folkestone today to lift the spirits of refugees in the barracks and show them that Britain cares,” they said. “Together we made sure the hundreds of people there know that they ARE welcome in this country.” Amani Arab, a 26-year-old woman who came to the UK as a refugee from Syria, was also at the event. “The Folkestone community is very friendly and welcoming. When I came here I felt that everyone wanted you to be part of this community.” So far only one charity, Migrant Help, has been able to enter the site but other organisations are in talks with the authorities to provide services. • This article was amended on 19 and 26 October 2020 to clarify details about the counter-protests."
2020-09-13T05:09:19Z,The Observer view on the EU's refugee crisis | Observer editorial,"Scenes of devastation and desperation at the burnt-out refugee camp at Moria, on the Greek island of Lesbos, are powerful reminders that Europe’s migrant crisis never really ended. The response of EU member states and close neighbours such as Britain has, with some exceptions, once again been shamefully inadequate. The fact that these failures are familiar does not lessen the immediate, dreadful human impact of this latest tragedy, nor does it obviate the urgent need to find lasting solutions. If fire had not destroyed most of the Moria camp last week, leaving up to 13,000 people without food, water and shelter, it’s a safe bet most of Europe would have continued to turn a blind eye to what was already a scandal on its doorstep. Repeated pleas by local people and the Greek government for more EU support and solidarity would have continued to be ignored. Pictures of small children and bereft families, deprived of all they own, squatting by the roadside or in filthy doorways, have pricked consciences – at least for now. Charities hope the disaster will prove a permanent turning point. “The Moria camp was already unfit for humans before the fire, with four times as many people than it was built for,” said Francesco Rocca, head of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. “Enough is enough. Now is the time to show some humanity and move these people to a healthy, safe and humane place. There are 4,000 children in Moria and no child should have to endure this.” Germany has again taken the lead in offering help, as it did during the 2015 refugee crisis. Plans have been made to transfer 400 unaccompanied minors to 10 European countries, with about 150 going to Germany. The EU commission said about 1,600 people would be given temporary shelter aboard a ferry. After visiting the area, commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas promised a larger, more modern facility would be built at the same location. These are mere stop-gap measures and many locals and migrants oppose replacing the destroyed camp at all. But, as in the past, political obstacles at the national level are preventing a more comprehensive response. Several German regions and cities have offered to take in refugees. In Berlin, about 3,000 people took to the streets last week to demand a more generous attitude. “We have room!” they shouted. Moria was a “camp of shame”. Yet Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, a critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s now-revoked 2015 open-door policy, said the focus should be on providing “help on the ground”. Such caution reflects continuing Europe-wide concern about a resurgence of the anti-immigrant sentiment that has boosted far-right populist and ultra-nationalist groups. It also reflects a divided EU’s repeated failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy based on shared responsibility, though it says new proposals are imminent. Britain’s reaction to Moria is even more deeply unsatisfactory. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has yet to respond to a letter from the Labour peer Lord Dubs urging admission of unaccompanied children. “The government cannot keep dodging the issue,” he wrote. But it seems determined to try. When the Médecins Sans Frontières charity asked Patel in March to accept more children from Moria and other overcrowded Greek camps threatened by Covid-19, she did not deign to reply. Quite how Boris Johnson hopes to establish a leading role for “global Britain” when it ducks its share of responsibility for tackling international migration, one of the great global problems of the day, is hard to fathom. Patel pretends to care about the safety of relatively small numbers of migrants crossing the Channel, over which rightwing bigots and xenophobes have kicked up an enormous fuss. Yet she and other ministers have nothing to say about the catastrophe in Moria and no help to offer. How small minded. How demeaning. How very un-British."
2020-11-24T15:28:08Z,Rescuers recover migrants' wedding rings lost at sea,"On 9 November, a migrant rescue boat came across a red backpack floating in the Mediterranean alongside other remains from a shipwreck that took place weeks before. The rucksack, covered with sea snails and reeking of petrol, contained two wedding rings, inscribed with the names Ahmed and Doudou. “We thought it was proof of yet another love story that ended up at the bottom of the sea,” said Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, who recovered the personal items. “Unfortunately we find many of these. Most of the time suitcases and bags, floating in the sea, are nothing more than symbols of yet another journey that began in Libya and ended in tragedy.” Nevertheless, as it always does, Open Arms activated a procedure to try to trace the owners of the belongings by sharing the photos on their social channels and among their networks of contacts. “What happened next was exciting,” Gatti said. Thanks to an article published in the newspaper La Repubblica that carried photos of the rings, the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) discovered they belonged to a newlywed Algerian couple, Ahmed, 25, and Doudou, 20. The couple, who were staying at a reception centre in Sicily, were among 15 survivors of a shipwreck that took place off the coast of the island of Lampedusa on 21 October in which five people died. “As soon as they showed us the photos of the rings, I couldn’t believe it,” Ahmed said in a message passed on by MSF. ‘‘We had lost everything and now the few things we set out with on the journey have been found. It’s incredible. “The rings were in the backpack because they had broken and we wanted to have them repaired once we arrived in Europe,” Ahmed added. ‘’None of my travel companions managed to recover anything. We are very happy but we are still mourning our friends who didn’t make it.” Ahmed and Doudou told aid workers that they had left Zawiya in Libya on a small wooden boat with 20 other people on 19 October. Forty-eight hours into the crossing, however, their petrol ran out and the boat was left at the mercy of the sea, with weather conditions starting to deteriorate. Ester Russo, a psychologist at MSF who spoke to the couple, said survivors from the shipwreck had told of a big wave that hit about 60km off Lampedusa. “The 15 people onboard were saved by a Sicilian fishing boat,” Russo said. “Five people died, including a two-year-old girl. Her mother was shocked. Time stopped for her when she no longer saw her daughter. On that same trip a nine-year-old child lost his mother and is now alone in Italy.” Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for MSF in Sicily, said Doudou was trying to recover from the trauma of the journey. “She is still in shock from what happened,” Rousan said. “She saw five travel companions die in front of her eyes, including a child. But both she and Ahmed are fine.” The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship. which is off the coast of Sicily. “We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,” said Gatti. “We can’t wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too. It’s not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.”"
2020-09-10T17:29:39Z,Covid-19 fears on Lesbos as thousands of refugees flee huge fires,"Greek authorities on Lesbos are racing to find refugees who had tested positive for Covid-19 before a series of devastating fires forced thousands to flee Europe’s biggest migrant camp. Health officials have rushed 19,000 test kits to the north-eastern Aegean island amid fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. “It’s a very dangerous, very explosive situation,” Efstratios Tzimis, Mytilene’s deputy mayor, told the Guardian. “And it’s making all of us crazed. On the one hand there’s coronavirus, on the other thousands of desperate, hungry people.” Only eight of the more than three dozen refugees diagnosed with the virus have been found. Authorities say they have been quarantined in a special area with close family members. Extra police units were dispatched to the island on Thursday, reinforcing a cordon around Moria, whose charred remains were still smouldering when new fires erupted in and around the facility more than 24 hours after the main blaze began. Men, women and children deprived of shelter slept on the sides of roads, in olive groves and even a graveyard after the fires that began late on Tuesday. Many awoke on Thursday huddled in sheets and blankets that were their only protection against gale-force winds. Hopes of some being able to return to the small section of the hilltop camp that survived the inferno were crushed by a second wave of fire. In the early morning light, former residents could be seen in the apocalyptic landscape desperately foraging for belongings. Less than 48 hours after the first blaze, the notoriously overcrowded facility – home to 13,000 people at the beginning of the week – was reduced to little more than a heap of mangled steel and melted tent tarpaulin. Greek officials, who have declared a state of emergency on Lesbos, say the fires were deliberately started by asylum seekers reacting to quarantine measures after Covid-19 infections were detected. Moria, like other refugee camps in Greece, has been in lockdown since the start of the pandemic in March. The confinement has fuelled anger and hostility among people who, before the pandemic, had been waiting, often for years, for answers to asylum requests. “Some people do not respect the country that is hosting them,” Stelios Petas, a government spokesman, told reporters in Athens. “They believed that if they set fire to Moria, they’d be able to leave the island indiscriminately,” he added, saying only unaccompanied minors would be removed from Lesbos. “We tell them they did not understand. They will not leave because of the fire.” In an EU-funded operation a third chartered plane carrying the last of 406 children hosted at the holding centre flew from Mytilene’s international airport to northern Greece on Thursday morning. From there they are expected to continue their journeys to EU countries that have promised to take them in. Relief efforts have focused on the government and UN refugee agency sending in thousands of tents in addition to a ferryboat and two naval ships to temporarily accommodate people. The centre-right government faces staunch opposition from local residents tired of their island being on the frontline of migratory flows from the war-torn Middle East, Africa and Asia. In the summer of 2015, at the height of Syria’s civil war, close to 1 million refugees crossed the sea from Turkey to Europe via Lesbos. A former army barracks originally designed to host fewer than 3,000 people, Moria was eight times over capacity at the beginning of the year. Human rights groups have criticised the facility, and its dire living conditions, as the wretched face of Europe’s bungled migration policies and inability to humanely manage refugees. Many have called it a stain on the conscience of the continent. On Thursday, as the army cleaned up the wreckage with bulldozers and diggers, infuriated villagers set up roadblocks to prevent them accessing the camp. “‘[The refugees] have to go somewhere else,” said Tzimis, the deputy mayor. “We understand their plight, but people here are also exhausted. Either they are taken to an uninhabited island or, if that can’t happen, Europe should take them in.” Greece’s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, a steadfast supporter of open-air island camps such as Moria being replaced by smaller, “closed” detention centres, called for calm. The prospect of the centres has however been criticised by aid groups and islanders, who fear that the camps will become permanent fixtures. “Everyone has to be realistic,” Mitarachi told Skai TV, saying the government’s priority was to have “no homeless family” by the evening. “At this moment we are up against two fronts. The one is migrants who are resorting to blackmail to leave, the other local leaders who are not displaying the necessary responsibility at such a difficult [time].”"
2020-11-10T16:28:53Z,"Canary Islands appeal for help as 2,200 migrants arrive over weekend","The president of the Canary Islands has appealed for urgent help from the Spanish government and the EU after around 2,200 migrants arrived on the archipelago over the weekend, putting further strain on its already massively overstretched reception resources. Ángel Víctor Torres said the Canaries’ existing infrastructure could not cope with the number of people arriving, as the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to Europe attracted more refugees and migrants. “It’s not hard to sum up,” Torres said this week. “The flow of arrivals still greatly exceeds the reception capacity. They’re absorbed, they’re distributed and they’re relocated, but the flow of arrivals is still much higher than the reception response.” The regional president pointed out that 2,188 people had reached the islands over the weekend and that they were being housed in makeshift camps on the docks at Arguineguín on Gran Canaria. Torres said the Canaries could not be used as “prison islands” where people were held indefinitely, when there was far more reception space available in mainland Spain. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 11,000 people have arrived in the Canaries by sea so far this year, half of them in October alone, while 414 are feared to have died in the attempt. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. This year’s figures, however, are well down on 2006, when 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries by sea. Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and the EU’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, visited the islands last week. At a press conference on Friday, Johansson paid tribute to the “tremendous efforts” of the central and regional governments in managing the situation in such difficult times. But Torres asked for help that went beyond words, saying: “We’re not in a planning phase, we’re in a reaction phase.” He said the Covid-19 pandemic was making things ever harder, called for urgent action to dismantle the Arguineguín camp and appealed for the EU to make good on the “shared European commitment” to managing migration. Spain’s interior ministry, meanwhile, has been criticised for refusing to allow journalists to document the plight of those stuck on the Arguineguín docks. Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the Canaries over the weekend and described the conditions on the docks as “pretty awful”. She said the Spanish authorities had been slow to act, even after it became clear that the Atlantic route was opening up again. “The numbers surged and all of a sudden, it’s emergency mode and that’s when things get really bad,” she said. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland. Those are two very clear solutions.” Sunderland said she had spoken to some women on the docks who had been in the hot, crowded camp for more than two weeks. The longer the migrants and refugees stayed in the area, she said, the worse things would get. “They need to transfer people to the mainland,” she said. “That would alleviate the extreme pressure on the islands right now, which is a recipe for disaster.” Sunderland recognised that Spain, like Italy, had been badly affected by the pandemic, but said it needed to overhaul its “shortsighted and poor” policymaking. “This is a challenge – but it’s not something that Spain can’t handle in a humane way,” she said. “Of course it can; it’s just a lack of will and coordination and a bit of money.” In February, Spain’s migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. But the secretary of state for migration, Hana Jalloul, said the numbers of people arriving were overwhelming the islands’ reception resources. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. At least 140 people died last month after a boat carrying 200 people caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year."
2020-12-08T00:01:54Z,"End housing of asylum seekers in old army barracks, UK ministers urged","More than 60 community organisations working with migrants held in detention and refugees have urged ministers to consider alternative accommodation to the former army barracks currently being used to house asylum seekers following damning reports on conditions at the sites. Napier barracks in Kent and Penally barracks in Pembrokeshire, which between them hold more than 600 men, were handed over from the Ministry of Defence to the Home Office in September to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers. The Home Office has been hit by a raft of reports alleging poor access to healthcare, denial of access to lawyers, overbearing use of confidentiality agreements and concerns over safety and privacy at the sites. There has been at least one confirmed suicide attempt at one of the barracks. In a letter to the immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, the organisations, led by the Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (Avid), highlight parallels between the barracks and the UK’s system of indefinite immigration detention and calls for community-based alternatives to be sought. Other signatories include Refugee Action, Detention Action, Care4Calais, Migrant Rights Network, Kent Refugee Action Network (Kran), Doctors of the World UK, Choose Love/Help Refugees, Liberty, Jesuit Refugee Service UK and Samphire. Ali McGinley, the director of Avid, said: “There is no shortage of evidence that the UK’s system of immigration detention does very little other than cause long lasting damage: to the individuals held, but also to their families and communities. We’ve seen this first hand over many years. Choosing to ignore this by replicating the worst injustices of this system in the barracks accommodation is irresponsible, dangerous and puts many more people at risk.” The letter to Philp outlines how the isolated locations of the barracks have left residents exposed to abuse by far-right activists, who have been able to easily locate the former MoD sites. The Home Office has said the sites are temporary contingency accommodation for asylum seekers who will eventually be moved to dispersed accommodation such as houses or flats while their claims are considered. It said it intended to use the sites for a year. Official figures showed that in September, 76% of people awaiting a decision on their asylum claim had been waiting for more than six months, up from 58% in September 2019. The letter states there is growing evidence that managing people’s cases while they remain in the community with access to support is both less expensive and more effective. Given the significant backlog in processing asylum applications, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, it is time to consider alternatives, the letter says. Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “We have serious concerns about the mental and physical health of often traumatised people forced to live behind barbed wire and high fences so close to each other in the middle of a pandemic. People need access to medical and legal support that simply cannot be provided in those conditions. “Home Office ministers are failing in their duty of care to people in the asylum system. It must urgently work with providers to find more suitable accommodation in a wider range of areas across the country.” The Home Office has been approached for comment."
2020-11-12T07:15:01Z,Dozens of Sudanese migrants held in Cairo after protests,"Dozens of Sudanese refugees and migrants have been arrested after protests over the murder of a young boy in Cairo. Amnesty International said about 70 people, including children, were arrested by Egyptian security forces after what it said were two peaceful protests on 29 October. Amid reports of rising xenophobia and violence towards refugees in Egypt, the demonstrations were sparked by the stabbing of Sudanese 12 year-old Mohamed Hassan. An Egyptian man has been arrested over the killing. The rights group said security forces dispersed the protests using teargas and water cannon and that some of those arrested were beaten in police custody. The majority of the detainees were released the next day, but 10 men are still being held by the Egyptian intelligence services without access to lawyers. A cousin of one of the detainees said: “We are really concerned about them. We don’t know what’s going to happen for them.” Amnesty said that on 2 November, Egyptian security forces in plainclothes raided the homes and workplaces of at least five Sudanese activists. Others received phone calls, telling them they faced deportion. Several activists have now gone into hiding. The Public Prosecution Office has dismissed claims of human rights violations against foreign nationals in Egypt. According to a source working with refugees in Cairo, many opponents of the Sudanese government – particularly those from Darfur and the Nuba mountains – living in Egypt have been imprisoned, tortured and handed over to the Sudanese security forces by Egypt. According to reports on some Arabic websites, Egypt had in return asked Sudan to deport dozens of Muslim Brotherhood leaders to Cairo. “The Sudanese people who come from African backgrounds such as Nuba, Fur, Zagawa are faced with particular discrimination in Egypt,” said the source. “They are visibly black. While the experience in Egypt of Sudanese who come from Arab backgrounds is relatively better.” Almost 50,000 Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers currently live in Egypt, according to the UN. A woman from Darfur who was detained after a protest, said living conditions in Egypt were tough. “It’s so difficult being a refugee in Egypt. It’s three times harder than what we left behind in Darfur. Yes there were killings and rapes in Sudan, but here is worse. “Egypt looks safe from outside, but it’s so bad from inside,” said the 42-year-old. Of her time in jail she said: “What have we done to deserve all that? They threatened us that we will not see the sun again.” Elena Habersky, a project manager at Refugee Entitlements in Egypt, said the killing of Mohamed Hassan “struck a nerve” with the Sudanese refugee community. “His death was a straw that broke the camel’s back with regard to violence faced by Sudanese refugees … It was only logical that protests would ensue from the community to demand justice for the death of young Mohamed, but to also bring to light the difficulties faced, not only by the Sudanese refugee community, but by many African refugees in general.”"
2020-12-13T08:00:01Z,UK ‘reneges on vow to reunite child refugees with families’,"Unaccompanied children in France are being told by the French authorities that they should give up hope of being reunited with family in the UK after the Home Office failed to offer the help it had promised. With the deadline to enter the UK legally and safely under the EU’s family reunification rules due to expire at the end of the year, the Home Office is accused of reneging on its vow to help unaccompanied children reunite with family in the UK. A year ago, Boris Johnson told parliament that he was “absolutely committed to ensuring that this country will continue to receive unaccompanied children” after Britain left the EU. The Home Office had pledged to reunite families who applied before the 31 December deadline, with charities also saying they received assurances that the UK would continue to reunite families next year for cases accepted before the Brexit transition period ended. However, sources have now revealed that “no proper arrangements” were put in place by the UK for transfers under the family reunification Dublin agreement. Last week, French authorities, following discussions with the country’s interior ministry, began telling children and families that they could not apply to reunite with family in the UK. The move could also affect minors in refugee camps in Greece who are eligible for family reunion, forcing them to risk dangerous journeys in order to reach family in the UK. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the charity Safe Passage International, which helps with the transfer of unaccompanied minors to the UK, said: “Unaccompanied child refugees in Europe have been left with nothing more than broken promises and fading hopes of reuniting with family in the UK. It is devastating that children desperate to reunite with their family have been turned away because of government inaction and a failure in international cooperation.” So far, Safe Passage is aware of two families who have been told by French authorities that they could not apply for family reunification, including a Kuwaiti Bidoon woman with three children who is hoping to reunite with her husband in the UK. In addition, the charity knows of 20 cases of unaccompanied children and five families who are eligible to be transferred to the UK but will be refused unless the situation changes. Cases identified in northern France and Paris include 16 unaccompanied children from Afghanistan who are seeking to join family in the UK. One is a child hoping to join his brother, who originally fled the Taliban. In another case an Ethopian husband with two children is hoping to be reunited with his wife. Safe Passage is now urging the UK government to take immediate action to resolve the issue and to cooperate with France and the EU to help reunite families. A Home Office spokesperson said: “These claims are completely inaccurate. We are committed to continuing to process all family reunion cases, under the Dublin regulation, that entered the system before the end of the transition period. All EU member states can continue to make requests to the UK on the basis of family reunion and we will continue to assess and process these requests. “We have to help more people directly from the affected regions and that is exactly what we are planning with our new firm and fair asylum system, which will welcome people through safe and legal routes.”"
