2015-12-17T08:44:33Z,Where media fails on the reporting of migrants and refugees,"Journalists who report on the global migration and refugee crisis often fail to tell the full story and routinely fall into propaganda traps laid by politicians, according to a report published by the Ethical Journalism Network (EJN). “Around the world, media coverage is often politically led with journalists following an agenda dominated by loose language and talk of invasion and swarms,” said Aidan White, EJN’s director. But it doesn’t have to be like that. As White said: “At other moments the story is laced with humanity, empathy and a focus on the suffering of those involved.” The 100-page report, Moving Stories, has been released just ahead of the United Nations-sponsored International Migrants Day on Friday 18 December. It reviews media coverage of migration in the European Union and in 14 countries across the world. Among the topics it highlights are: Missed opportunities: How European media outlets failed to raise the alarm about an imminent influx of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq, even though the story was there to be told a year before the crisis broke in 2015. Hate speech: How malevolent anti-migrant or anti-Muslim statements by politicians like Donald Trump in the United States and some European leaders fuelled increasing public concern and hijacked media coverage. Falling standards: How media failed to provide detailed and reliable information about the refugee crisis because of stretched editorial resources or due to the lack of presence of well-informed journalists able to provide in-depth and sensitive reporting; Sensationalism: How much journalism is driven by hyperbole, intolerance and distortion with media in confusion over what are the correct terms to use to describe migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. To counter these problems, the report recommends that news media take urgent action to appoint specialist reporters to the migration beat. It also calls for industry wide and in-house training on migration issues and problems of hate-speech; improved links with migrant and refugee groups; and more employment of journalists from ethnic minority communities to strengthen diversity in newsrooms. The report highlights how media coverage, much of it negative and focused on numbers of migrants on the move, took a dramatic turn with the death of Alan Kurdi and the publication of pictures of his body on a beach in Turkey. It was only from that moment that editors woke up to the human tragedy within the migration story. In his foreword to the report Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, sums up the challenge facing media: “It is not just a lack of humanity on the news agenda or a matter of luck or a matter of caring more about some people at the expense of others. We need a broader lens to see what really is going on. The reports states: “There is a tendency, both among many politicians and in sections of the mainstream media, to lump migrants together and present them as a seemingly endless tide of people who will steal jobs, become a burden on the state and ultimately threaten the native way of life. “Such reporting is not only wrong; it is also dishonest. Migrants often bring enormous benefits to their adopted countries.” Download the full report HERE"
2015-11-05T20:05:28Z,Diane Abbott: economic migrants and refugees deserve equal sympathy,"Economic migrants coming to Britain should be treated with the same sympathy as refugees fleeing war, Diane Abbott has said. The shadow international development secretary also said it is wrong and racist to claim, as some of her colleagues in the Labour party had done previously, that eastern European immigrants were the cause of wage cuts for English workers. Abbott was speaking on Thursday at an event to welcome refugees in north London also attended by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The refugee and immigration issue is likely to be controversial as Labour seeks to defeat a Ukip challenge in next month’s Oldham West byelection, triggered by the death of Michael Meacher. She said: “I would remind you, thousands of people crossing the Sahara, risking their lives in the Mediterranean, coming over the Balkans, are also economic migrants and we do not want to fall into the error of thinking that refugees are in some sense a class of migrant more deserving of our sympathy. “Just as our hearts goes out to Syrians struggling, dying, suffering and drowning, our hearts should also go out to economic migrants in Nigeria, Eritrea and north Africa, struggling, drowning and suffering. Economic migrants are not a lesser cause.” She said the migration crisis had been caused by problems such as climate change and instability, but “above all there are issues with a series of ill-fated western interventions in Libya, Syria, Iraq and across the Middle East”. The European Union is predicting that there will be as many as 3 million refugees arriving in Europe next year. Without naming any individual, Abbott also criticised “those in the Labour party that seem to want to argue that immigrants are in some sense the cause of our economic woes”. She said: “This is something I deplore. Immigrants in and of themselves do not cause low wages. Predatory employers, deregulated labour markets and weakened trade unions – they cause low wages.” She argued that some people, including members of the Labour party, wrongly contend that the current debate about immigration is not about race by pointing to the fact that eastern Europeans are white. Abbott said: “I would refer them to the toxic anti-Irish racism of the 19th century – the way the Irish were dehumanised and caricatured. Every single allegation made against the eastern Europeans – they were undercutting local labour, they were driving down wages, that they were the cause of the problems of the English working class – every single allegation that you hear made against eastern European migrants today, they said about the Irish in the 19th century. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.” The government’s response to the crisis was inadequate because the refugee conversation had been poisoned by the toxic debate about immigration year after year, she said. Abbott added that it was hypocritical of neoliberals to wring their hands about the effects of eastern Europeans on wages, since it was the liberalisation of labour markets and the weakening of trade unions that were the real culprits. She described Corbyn as “the first authentically leftwing leader of the Labour party in a generation”. Speaking at the event, Corbyn said his success in the Labour leadership election showed “the politics of me, not we, are over”. “It was a victory not for me, but for all those that want to see a different, better and more peaceful world,” he said. He called on Britain to “hold out the hand of humanity and not brutality to refugees. I do not use the language of swarm and swamp and all those things. I look at those people as fellow human beings, just like you, just like me, just doing their best to survive in a cruel and dangerous world”. Corbyn said David Cameron’s pledge to take in up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years was inadequate, pointing to the hundreds of thousands being granted asylum by Germany and urging the government to assist local councils in giving a place of safety to refugees in the UK. He insisted he held no brief for those fighting in Syria, and said he only wanted peace in the region. “Further bombing, further interventions, further boots on the ground, further wars is not going to solve the problem. All wars have to end by a political solution,” Corbyn added. Without specifying how many refugees the British government should take, the Labour leader pointed out that Germany has taken hundreds of thousands of refugees and Britain should be doing more. He said: “Refugees should not be treated as a problem, a threat, a difficulty and somehow or other to be confronted and kept out.“The problem across Europe will not be solved by the construction of razor-wire fences around countries, by having gun boats in the sea and by having electronic surveillance and tagging of people all across the world that are trying to achieve a place of safety.” The solution lay “in greater equality and above all by ending the series of wars that have disfigured this century so far,” Corbyn added."
2015-08-28T15:51:21Z,"Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers: what's the difference?","In the current migration crisis, the terms “migrant”, “refugee” and less commonly “asylum seeker” are used daily to mean one and the same thing. Each term, however, has a distinct meaning that carries different international obligations and consequences. If conflated, it can mean the difference between life and death. So what are thoe differences? Migrant At its simplest, a migrant is someone who moves from one place to another in order to live in another country for more than a year. The International Organisation of Migration estimates that 232 million people a year become international migrants and another 740 million move within their own countries. The are many reasons that people become migrants, but those who move to work or seek a better life are generally termed economic migrants. There are, however, also international students, those who move for family reasons and those who migrate because they are fleeing war and persecution. An individual case can be a mixture of all those things. It is, after all, possible to flee the war in Syria and want a better life for your family. Migrants from outside the EU are subject to immigration controls and may need a visa to enter certain countries, including Britain. They do not have immediate access to social housing or benefits, but may have an eventual pathway to settlement and citizenship. They can also be detained or deported if they fail to comply with immigration laws. Just over 636,000 migrants arrived in Britain in the past 12 months, according to the latest figures, which included 25,000 asylum seekers. Once migrants arrive in a country such as Britain there is little agreement over what the word covers. In the past “immigrant” has meant someone who intends to settle in a new country. “Migrant” has been increasingly adopted to cover those who come to work for a short period then return home. “The migrant population” is used to describe foreign nationals resident in a country, but also those who are foreign-born residents even if they have become citizens. Refugee A refugee is a person who has fled armed conflict or persecution and who is recognised as needing of international protection because it is too dangerous for them to return home. They are protected under international law by the 1951 refugee convention, which defines what a refugee is and outlines the basic rights afforded to them. The convention’s basic principle is that refugees should not be expelled or returned to situations where their life and freedom would be under threat. Once someone has been recognised as a refugee, they are supposed to be given access to social housing and welfare benefits and helped to find a job and integrate into society. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that there are almost 60 million forcibly displaced people around the world, including those displaced within their own countries. Asylum seeker States are under international obligation to consider claims for asylum and not to immediately return asylum seekers to the countries they have fled from. The refugee convention states that they must be given access to fair and efficient asylum procedures and measures to ensure they live in dignity and safety while their claims are processed. In the UK in practice this means living in no-choice accommodation outside London and south-east England on a minimal level of social security."
2015-09-04T08:20:59Z,"Refugees are Australia's most entrepreneurial migrants, says research","Refugees are not taking Australian jobs, they are creating new ones, according to new government research that reveals humanitarian arrivals are the country’s most entrepreneurial migrants. People from the UK and India – most of whom arrived on skilled or family visas – contributed the largest share of the $38bn earned by migrants in Australia in 2009-10, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released on Friday, reveals. But it was migrants who arrived as refugees who reported the highest proportion of their incomes that year “from their own unincorporated businesses”. This income grew with the length of time they spent in Australia, and “increased sharply” after five years of residency. The report built on earlier research showing humanitarian migrants tended to work several jobs in their first few years in Australia to build capital to start their own businesses, the ABS said. One such entrepreneur is Bassam Jabbar, who recently arrived from Iraq, and with the help of Settlement Services International (SSI), has established a glass-etching artwork business. He told Guardian Australia the biggest hurdle to starting a business was “knowing the country, knowing how people think, the regulations”. “Refugees have left their country, their society, their language behind and so of course they find it easier to work in their own business – especially artists,” he said. Nearly 10% of humanitarian migrants’ incomes in 2009-10 were generated by their own businesses, almost twice the figure recorded in other categories, such as skilled and family migrants. This income was overwhelmingly made by men, most aged between 25 and 44. Afghans earned the largest share of the profits generated by humanitarian migrant businesses. Violet Roumeliotis, the chief executive of SSI, said she “wasn’t surprised at all” by the data. “Being from countries where they need to be enterprising to survive, because there’s no welfare state, refugees are keen to pick an area of passion or where they have a skill and start a business,” she said."
2015-11-19T14:09:16Z,Aid groups say Balkan states blocking refugees based on nationality,"Countries along the Balkan migration trail have begun refusing to admit people of certain nationalities, amid a backlash against refugees in the aftermath of the Paris attacks last Friday. Humanitarian workers active along the borders of Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia reported that refugees and migrants from countries other than Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq were now being stopped, raising the spectre of a migrant logjam in Greece. The move comes after Slovenia, the most northerly country along the trail, suddenly tried to return 168 Moroccan migrants to Croatia on Thursday, in the first major development along the Balkan migration route since Hungary shut its border in September. The decision sparked panic among the countries to Slovenia’s south, who feared that Slovenia was about to block access to anyone who could not easily prove their need for refugee status, and consequently turned back all migrants from Africa and southern Asia. Slovenia said on Thursday afternoon it had not made any permanent decisions, and promised to admit refugees as long as Germany and Austria continued to subsequently take them. But a police spokesman confirmed that Slovenia would discuss with its Balkan neighbours how to limit the flow of so-called economic migrants in the future. “We absolutely need to provide protection to those who need it, whose lives are threatened, who are escaping war zones,” said a spokesman for the Slovenian interior ministry. “For others we will need to reach an agreement on how to respond. No country has limitless capacity, so the capacity should be for those whose lives are really in need.” For now, campaigners on the ground said people from Africa, Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh – who collectively amount to less than 10% of the flow through the Balkans, according to the UN – were already trapped in limbo at the borders of Croatia, Serbia, and Macedonia, since the three countries did not want to risk the possibility of anyone being stuck on their territory. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Macedonia had begun to build a barrier along its southern border with Greece. A spokeswoman for the Macedonian interior ministry denied any such barrier was being built, but MSF’s team leader on the border said it was clear that some kind of obstacle was being constructed. “It’s obvious that they want to do something,” said MSF’s Antonis Rigas. “Every 20 metres they’ve put out stones. What for? They haven’t started the construction, but I’m an engineer, and I can say it’s there for something.” Earlier in the week, Macedonia’s cabinet said it was considering whether to build a fence. But it claimed that such a fence, if built, would be used to block the passage of migrants only if upstream countries did the same, risking a bottleneck on Macedonian territory. Serbia has promised not to build a fence, but Slovenia is preparing one in order to better control the flow of refugees. Hungary completed work on a fence in mid-September, causing the refugee route to swerve westwards into Croatia. Should the Balkan countries block the route entirely, Greece may be forced to deal with a logjam of refugees. An average of 4,750 people a day have arrived on its shores from Turkey this month, down from the October average of 6,800 but above the August daily rate of 3,500. Though their problems have received less attention than those of Syrians, many refugees from Africa and south Asia claim to be fleeing human rights abuses. A backlash against migrants and refugees has intensified after a passport used by a migrant to enter Greece in early October was found near the body of a dead bomber in Paris. Police are not yet sure whether the passport holder was a the terrorist. But the uncertainty has led to fears about the threat posed by thousands of undocumented migrants entering Europe’s south-eastern borders, some of whom carry fake documentation. A spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the Balkan countries risked failing to uphold the UN convention on refugees should they begin to screen arrivals on the basis of their origin. “It is important that every individual who is seeking asylum has access to a fair and efficient asylum procedure, regardless of their nationality,” the spokeswoman said. “UNCHR is monitoring the situation and recommending governments that each case is decided based on its predicaments not on the nationality of the asylum seeker. All countries along the Balkans route are signatories to the 1951 convention and UNHCR has been working with the government to build their asylum systems.” Over 600,000 people have so far attempted to walk through the Balkans after landing in Greece in 2015."
2015-12-11T10:42:07Z,"The media needs to tell the truth on migration, not peddle myths | Alberto Nardelli","Over the past week a lot has been said about the success of the far-right Front National at the French regional elections, while the reaction to Donald Trump’s increasingly discriminatory tone has, rightly, been one mostly of disgust. We are right to stand up to the Le Pens and Trumps of this world. When they splutter remarks that are incendiary and false, we have a responsibility to correct their inaccuracies. The reasons why the ideas of the Front National take hold are plentiful and complicated. There is no single simple explanation. However, there can be no doubt that misinformation does not help – and we in the media should feel a professional and moral obligation to confront our own industry when it misleads. The front page of Thursday’s Times of London splashed: “EU buckles as Merkel’s migrants hit 1 million.” The headline topped an article about comments made by the UK prime minister, David Cameron, who said that net migration of 300,000 a year was not sustainable in Britain. The piece also referenced demands that Cameron is making to other European leaders to apply restrictions to EU nationals’ access to UK’s welfare. The Times story pieces together different stories and conflates a range of issues. The result is a distasteful minestrone. First, the one million figure refers to the number of asylum seekers that have arrived in Germany so far this year. The majority of these are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. They are refugees fleeing wars. Second, whatever one thinks of Britain’s level of migration - whether it is too high or not is besides the point - the number has little to do with refugees. The UK hardly takes any refugees. In fact fewer than 5% of migrants to Britain over the past year were asylum seekers. Third, we can state with certainty that refugees escaping conflict are not doing so to claim in-work tax credits. Fourth, the migrants are Angela Merkel’s only insofar as Germany is one of a handful of countries that is welcoming refugees instead of putting up fences, turning the other way, or, like Britain, taking in pitifully low numbers. The problem with the article is more than just a question of interpretation or of cavalier use of terms. Facts without humanity are meaningless. The choice of words we use matters and carries consequences. Behind the use of words like “migrant”, “refugee”, “asylum seeker”, “people”, “swarms” and “floods”, there is powerful symbolism. When terms used for people fleeing war, violence and atrocities, or those used for people moving in search of work, or a better life, become pejorative and generate antipathy, we have a problem. We are choosing not to unite around a shared purpose, but to drive a wedge through society. We are taking an us v them view on the world. There are grave risks when the perception of an issue and facts do not align. It doesn’t matter if the misalignment creates the idea of a country that isn’t grounded in reality – when untruths are repeated often enough they generate fear among people. In turn this defines and drives behaviour. Consider these facts: Britons believe that 23% of migrants are coming to UK to seek asylum while the actual proportion is less than 5% Nearly 40% of Europeans cite immigration as the issue of most concern facing the EU – more than any other issue. Only a year ago, less than 25% of people said the same. One in two of the British public mention immigration as among the most important issues facing the country. Most Europeans greatly overestimate the proportion of their country’s population that is comprised of migrants. The Times of course is not alone. Nearly every day we read headlines about the true toll of mass migration on UK life, the crisis in our schools, the swarms on our streets, migrants stealing our jobs, draining the NHS and fuelling a surge in crime – all actual headlines. Last week a journalist fabricated a tale in order to be able to claim that he had travelled along a refugee route without a passport. This is how far we have come. The same newspaper that carried that particular story (for which it has apologised), had only weeks earlier controversially led with “1 in 5 Brit Muslim’s sympathy for jihadis”. The point is this: the likes of Le Pen and Trump are not a product of the media. However, too often the media provides them with the ammunition and fertile ground that they require to thrive. Don’t take my word for it. Take Trump’s: During a trip to Europe in the 1930s a young John F Kennedy wrote a letter to a friend. In it he said: “It seems so easy to fall into a distorted view of public affairs based more on personal bias than on informed understanding.” The challenge we face is not new. But it is one that remains not only critical, it is one we have mostly failed to meet. If we want to confront the Le Pens and Trumps of this world then we need to change the way we talk about the people that they vilify."
2015-10-19T00:02:01Z,"Battle for Aleppo threatens to create fresh refugee exodus, says Turkish PM","The battle for Aleppo, compounded by Russian airstrikes on the city, threatens to create a new refugee exodus from Syria, Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, has warned. Speaking after talks with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Davutoğlu called for action to prevent a new wave of refugees from moving north across the Turkish border. Aleppo is under assault both from Isis and from forces backing the Syrian government, including Iranian fighters and Russian aircraft. As the influx of refugees into Europe continued, Hungary closed its border with Croatia at the weekend, forcing thousands of migrants to find a new route to through Slovenia and into Austria. On Sunday, Slovenia said it would restrict its intake to 2,500 arrivals a day to ease pressure on both its own and Austria’s borders. The decision caused delays further down the migrant trail, raising fears of human bottlenecks. Davutoğlu said on Sunday: “It is our priority that steps will be taken to prevent an increase of refugees from Aleppo due to the offensive [there] by Iranian militia, Isis and Russian attacks.” “Aleppo is Syria’s second-biggest city. The [Russian] airstrikes in and around Aleppo as well as the Isis attack on the city worry us. They could cause another wave of refugees.” Merkel said Germany was prepared to accelerate accession process for Turkey’s membership of EU in exchange for Turkish help to secure European borders and to make sure that fewer refugees reach Europe. “How can we organise the accession process more dynamically?” Merkel asked at the press conference in Istanbul. “Germany is ready to open chapter 17 this year, and to make preparations for [chapters] 23 and 24. We can talk about the details,” she added, referring to EU accession procedures. Faced with a record influx of refugees this year, Germany is keen for countries on the migration frontline – particularly Turkey and Greece – to deal with the problem there rather than export it north. The onward passage of refugees through the Balkans towards central Europe in recent weeks has placed huge pressure on transit countries. Human rights groups have condemned the European plan for ignoring the rights of refugees. “Talks between the EU and Turkey on ‘migration management’ risk putting the rights of refugees a distant second behind border control measures designed to prevent refugees from reaching the EU,” Andrew Gardner, Turkey researcher for Amnesty International said on Saturday. Davutoğlu said Turkey was prepared to cooperate with Germany and the EU to prevent illegal migration, but underlined that the refugee crisis could not be solved without finding a solution to the war in Syria. Pointing out that Turkey has more than two million Syrian refugees and has spent approximately $7.5bn (£5bn) since the refugee crisis began, he said the international community needed to show more support. The government in Ljubljana said it had refused on Sunday to allow in a train carrying 1,800 migrants from Croatia, after more than 3,000 people surged into the tiny EU member state the day before. German police union chief Rainer Wendt told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper Germany should build a fence along its border with Austria. “If we close our borders this way, Austria will also close its border with Slovenia, and that’s exactly the effect we need,” he said. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"
2015-12-20T09:00:48Z,Prejudice against migrants speaks 311 different languages,"Did you know that the English language is “starting to die out” in British schools; indeed, that in some of them “English is barely heard at all”? Answer yes if you read a Daily Express front page “special investigation” that reported 311 different tongues apparently spoken in our classrooms. Answer no if you read last week’s Independent Press Standards Organisation verdict on the tale, which found it “inaccurate” and “completely unsupported” by the cited data. Commodious correction with front page presence enforced. Good for Ipso, you may say. At least the Voice of Desmond must fall silent for five minutes or so. But then put this finding in a wider, more dismaying context. “ Moving Stories” – a new report from the Ethical Journalism Network – sets media coverage of refugee crises and migrant flows in exactly that broader landscape and duly seeks many, rather obvious, reforms: expertise, particular care, training, access, increased resources. In sum, standard ethical answers to ethical dilemmas. But, then again, the report’s recommendations can’t be more compelling than the basic situation it outlines – one which changes from country to country, from Turkey to the Gambia to China; lands where migration and attitudes to it vary profoundly. What you think about it depends on where you sit. There is no One Problem: there are countless different problems. And that is our special problem. Which columnist said: “I don’t care. Show me pictures of coffins, show me bodies floating in water, play violins and show me skinny people looking sad. I still don’t care … these migrants are like cockroaches. They might look a bit ‘Bob Geldof’s Ethiopia circa 1984’, but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb. They are survivors”? Which big TV channel warned that “Islamic State is flooding Europe with refugees”? Which prime minister warned that “two million refugees are waiting on the border”? That first, now notorious, quote comes, of course, from Katie Hopkins in the Sun. But the television news headline is Bulgarian, as is the PM with two million on his mind. And Moving Stories has many more grisly examples – from Italy to the inevitable US – of supposed fact stewed in fear, hate and botched perception. What’s to be done (apart from building checklists)? The Italian Carta di Roma, an agreement on responsible coverage of the refugee crisis between many of Italy’s major media players, damns “inaccurate, simplified or distorted information” in clause 1. The editors’ code at Ipso in Britain echoes almost exactly the same formula, with “misleading” instead of “simplified”. There’s no rocket science here. Facts on refugee numbers, refugee plights, refugee solutions are vital. Facts on migrant languages, migrant assimilation, migrant children are vital, too. Of course it’s all difficult: too many national standpoints, too many myths, too much misunderstanding-cum-malice. Of course one person’s fact can be another person’s prejudice. But don’t hide modest satisfaction when the woolliest yarns are disentangled. Make a new passion for fact-checking the theme song of 2016. Leveson: the force doesn’t reawaken After Part One, you’ll remember, there was supposed to be Leveson Part Two. But settle down at the back. Various reasons for a pronounced lack of action can be evinced. Judges (least of all Sir Brian) see no point in presiding over such arid revels. Governments manifest nil enthusiasm for finding the cash. But the basic reasons for total forgetfulness lie in the original briefs. Stage Two was supposed to examine “the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other media organisations or other organisations. It will also consider the extent to which any relevant police force investigated allegations relating to News International, and whether the police received corrupt payments or were otherwise complicit in misconduct.” Well, we sort of know what happened inside News International. See the decision not to pursue criminal corporate proceedings. And we know how the trail ran dry at Trinity Mirror (though not, of course, the mighty legal tsunami of civil claims still washing up on the Mirror’s beach). But the role of the boys in blue – including some in the uppermost regions of Scotland Yard? There the Leveson Crystal Ball One misted over pretty swiftly. Crystal Ball Two, then, would surely have been about the links, the columns, the contracts – the merry-go-round that found Fleet Street and the Yard much too close for comfort. Thank heavens for officialdom’s wisdom in deeming that we’ve heard quite enough of such discomfiting stuff. Case closed."
2015-04-06T06:21:30Z,Reclaim Australia rallies 'hurtful' to new migrants and refugees,"Refugees and new migrants feel more isolated and vulnerable following last weekend’s Reclaim Australia rallies, community leaders said. The anti-Islam rallies on Saturday attracted hundreds of demonstrators nationwide who were protesting against halal certification, sharia law and increased Muslim migration. Counterprotests were held in several cities, in some cases eclipsing the original rallies. Edward Solo, vice president of the Federation of African Communities Councils in Australia, said the anti-Islam rallies are “hurtful”. “It is really a fearful message,” he said. Solo said many new arrivals will worry that they will be the next targets of the rallies. “It is hurtful to your efforts to rebuild your lives [which were] shattered back home,” he said. Kon Karapanagiotidis from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that the protests build on the anti-refugee sentiment that has been stirred up by the government’s hardline border protection policies. “This is a community that feels like it is under attack, a community that feels isolated and unwelcome,” he said. “Reclaim Australia makes asylum seekers feel more under threat.” Joe Caputo, chair of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Council of Australia, was wary of giving the protesters too much publicity, labelling them “a totally isolated fringe group that is insignificant”. He said demonstrators were “ignorant”, “misinformed” and “out of this world”, pointing to the fact that no mainstream organisations or politicians attended the rallies as evidence that they are in the minority. But chief executive of the Arab Council, Randa Kattan, warned that even small groups can be dangerous. “In terms of numbers they might be insignificant, but in terms of damage, it is significant,” she said. Kattan said it “only takes one incident” of racism or hatred to spark simmering tensions. The protesters are “squeaky wheels grabbing attention” in order to exploit existing divisions, she said. Solo dismissed protesters’ concerns that Australia would consider adopting sharia law, saying that “lacks serious grounds for action”. “Nothing of that nature can happen now ... or in the immediate future,” he said. Karapanagiotidis has criticised politicians from both sides for not speaking out against the Reclaim Australia rallies, drawing a contrast with German chancellor Angela Merkel who spoke out against ultra rightwing group Pegida by saying members had “hatred in their hearts”. He said the silence of politicians is “damning”, accusing them of exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment. Executive director of the Australian Multicultural Foundation, Hass Dellal, said that there is a “fear of the unknown” within the community, and that the rallies “shouldn’t be dismissed”. He said the best way to overcome that fear is via interfaith initiatives and through open engagement between diverse groups."
2015-11-11T13:16:08Z,US millionaire extends migrant rescue mission to Turkey and Greece,"An American millionaire has launched a private rescue mission in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to save the lives of a still-increasing number of refugees and migrants sailing from Turkey to Greece. The Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas), a charity founded and run by Chris Catrambone, an American entrepreneur, already runs a rescue mission off the coast of Libya, and will now operate a second boat in waters between the Turkish coastline and the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos. The ship’s two speedboats will be named after the two Syrian children, Aylan and Galip Kurdi, whose deaths in early September sparked international outrage. Several hundred thousand refugees, mainly Syrian and Afghan, have crossed this stretch of the Aegean Sea this year, and a rising number are now drowning due to the stormier weather conditions. A record 3,460 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far in 2015, roughly 450 of whom drowned in the Aegean, according to figures supplied by the UN refugee agency. Explaining the decision, the charity’s director, Martin Xuereb, said: “As long as people are crossing for one reason or other, there needs to be an asset there that mitigates loss of life at sea. We’re not saying that saving lives will solve the issue of migration, we know it’s much more complex than that. But we’re there to look after the individuals or groups who feel they have no other option to take to boats whether it’s the central Mediterranean [north of Libya], or the Aegean.” Moas’s decision to expand search-and-rescue operations comes on the day that EU leaders meet in Malta for the latest in a series of conferences about how to end migration to Europe. Xuereb said he hoped the existence of Moas, and the high level of donations it has received from the general public in recent months, will show European leaders there is a substantial level of public support for more humane responses to the crisis. “I think what we have done is show that there is a section of people who do not want to be bystanders and do not want people to drown at sea,” said Xuereb, the former commander-in-chief of the Maltese army. “I’m not just talking about Moas, but the thousands of people who have supported us.” Moas will also begin rescue missions off the coast of south-east Asia in the coming months. Doctors Without Borders also operates rescue missions in the southern Mediterranean."

So far Germany has put other nations to shame with plans to take 800,000 asylum seekers this year. There has also been a series of impressive voluntary campaigns and gestures, from Refugees Welcome – a scheme for sharing homes with those fleeing conflict and persecution described as ”an Airbnb for refugees” – to a professional football club fielding a third team made up entirely of refugees. By contrast the response of the British media has been characterised by fear rather than compassion, but there are plenty of ways that individuals can offer support. We want to hear about how you’ve helped those seeking asylum. But in the meantime, here’s a guide about some of the ways you can contribute. Give Money A number of charities and non-governmental organisations have opened appeals specifically aimed at helping the plight of refugees. Various organisations spell out exactly what a specific donation could provide. Here’s a sample: Migrant Offshore Aid Station: The charity which runs independent rescue boats to rescue migrants at risk of drowning has seen a huge spike in donations since pictures of the drowned Syrian boy emerged. Médecins Sans Frontières: The humanitarian agency has three rescue ships in the Mediterranean, on Tuesday alone they rescued 1,658 people in its biggest day of operations. Aylan Kurdi Fund: A specific fund named in honour of the drowned boy was set up within 24 hours of the circulation photographs of his body emerging. All proceeds will go to the humanitarian agency Hand in Hand for Syria. Refugee Council: A donation of £100 could pay for the education and travel for two children for a week. Unicef: The UN’s children’s charity is providing life-saving supplies such as clean water, medicine and psychological support. It says a donation of £9 could provide an emergency water kit for a family. Save the Children: It says a donation of £50 could buy two hygiene kits including soap, towels and toothbrushes. British Red Cross: A donation of £30 could buy 28 mats to help Syria refugees cope with the cold. Islamic Relief: Three families could be fed for a month on a donation of £210, the charity says. The crowdfunding website Just Giving has a list of specific appeals for migrants in Calais. It includes one of students trying to raise £750 to buy mobile phones, footballs, camping equipment, dictionaries, storage boxes, sanitary items and waterproof clothing. The UNHCR is running camps, providing shelter and aid to refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, as well as helping refugees across Europe. Other Donations It is not only cash that can help. Refugee Action is offering to take old cars as donations. It says the last scrap car it took raised £126 for refugees. It is also looking for old mobile phones and even printer cartridges. A Facebook group Music Against Borders is looking for musical instruments for migrant musicians in Calais. Teacher Mary Jones is looking for donations of books for her Jungle Books library named after the Calais migrant camp. The grass roots campaign Calais Action is urging supporters to donate in any way they can. It has put together a map of drop-off and collection zones. Volunteer The US refugee charity the International Rescue Committee has opportunities to volunteer at all of its 22 offices. Roles include mentoring refugee families and helping refugees find jobs. The organisation also asking for donations. Protest March on Downing Street in Solidarity with Refugees on Saturday 12 September. The protest begins at noon at London’s Marble Arch. The International Organisation for Migration is urging supporters to get involved in its #MigrantsContribute campaign, which promotes the cultural, economic, and political contributions that migrants make to society. A number of online petitions have been launched, including one calling for a more compassionate Europe-wide response to the crisis and another urging Britain to accept more asylum seekers. What are you doing to help?"
2015-11-27T10:00:04Z,Don't let the Paris climate talks ignore people displaced by global warming | Roberto Lovato,"We are all entering uncharted waters as the effects of climate change begin to create categories of migrants that have no precedent: migrants rendered stateless after their island nations disappear; migrants constituting a vast, roaming “environmental refugee” population; migrants fleeing climate-intensified wars and violence like that in Syria and Central America. In a matter of days, global leaders will enter the most delicate and potentially catastrophic discussions about civilization and migration in history. The UN COP21 conference on climate in Paris could decide the fate of people being displaced by climate change – the number of which has been forecast to be as many as 1 billion people, with 200 million being the most widely cited figure. In September New Zealand rejected Ioane Teitiota’s quest to become the world’s first officially recognized climate-change refugee, and deported him back to the island nation of Kiribati instead. Kiribati is so vulnerable to sea-level rise that its government recently purchased land in Fiji so that it would have a place to relocate its citizens when the islands are eventually submerged, a fate that now seems inevitable. Is this how the west will deal with climate-change refugees? COP21 should be addressing this very question yet, incredibly, the mention of the term migrants may be cut from the final agreement coming out of the critical global gathering. In October a revised draft of the conference agreement showed proposed deletions of any mention of “migrants” from the final conference agreement. Deleting just a over a dozen words will have many unfortunate consequences, including letting the countries of the global North off the hook for continuing with their current strategy. Instead of actually facing the crisis, the global North will just be policing migrants. Before the Paris attacks, the COP21 host country’s president, François Hollande, warned in a press conference in September that, without substantive climate action, “We won’t have hundreds of thousands of refugees in the next 20 or 30 years, but millions.” He also reminded the countries of the global North to fulfill their commitment, made during the 2009 Copenhagen (COP15) talks, to increase aid to the poorest, most climate-vulnerable countries to $100bn a year by 2020. That was before France’s 9-11. Since then, serious talk about serious issues is being replaced by the dangerous and outmoded xenophobic talk that has been making a worldwide comeback in the wake of the Paris attacks. The calls by Marine Le Pen, France’s far-right National Front party leader, to “expel” all the “illegal migrants who have nothing to do here” were echoed throughout the United States, where all Republican presidential candidates sounded immigration alarms. Marco Rubio, for example, called the attacks on Paris part of a larger “clash of civilizations” and also called for the United States to immediately “halt new admissions of refugees from Syria”. This has devastating effects on migrants: painting them as threats, rather than people fleeing threats from civil war, the rising ocean or, as is increasingly the case, violence and conflict that scientists say has been worsened by the effects of climate change. This shift now provides Northern countries another way to mask their unwillingness to deal with the migration crisis that their production and consumption habits have played a role in creating. Yet it is likely that “the burden of providing for climate migrants will be borne by the poorest countries – those least responsible for emissions of greenhouse gases”, according to the International Organization for Migration. The COP21 talks should take a reality-based approach, beginning with actually mentioning the word migrants in the agreement that comes out of the talks, as earlier drafts did. Before the titanic waves of coming displacement, members should also reinstate the idea that Australia (the nation whose outspokenness against dealing with climate migration has it playing the role of Donald Trump on the world migration stage) worked to have stricken from the plan: establishing a “climate change displacement coordination facility” to help with both emergency relief and planned relocations. Also being discussed (at least by the most climate-vulnerable countries) are proposals to include language that opens the door to providing legal protection to climate refugees. These protections aren’t simply a moral imperative; they represent the only civilized approach to climate migration. This piece was published in coordination with Creative Time Reports."
2015-10-20T09:27:21Z,More Eurotunnel delays as refugees rush terminal,"Eurotunnel customers faced hours of delays on Tuesday morning after refugees rushed the terminal in Calais in a desperate bid to break through security. Waiting time for passenger services in Folkestone was about two hours while the delay in Calais was about three hours. Eurotunnel said it was unable to sell tickets to passengers without reservations at either end. Eurotunnel has suffered disruption to its services throughout the summer, and now faces new tactics from refugees and migrants, whose numbers have swelled to 6,000 in the makeshift camps outside Calais, known as the Jungle. Eurotunnel said hundreds of refugees had tried to breach the 20-mile perimeter in recent days, in diversionary tactics. These large groups draw police and security personnel away from sensitive access points – roads and tracks near the terminal – that smaller groups then try to breach. The longer nights provide greater opportunity for refugees to operate under the cover of darkness. “These major surges in the early hours overcome security personnel and then they have to spend a couple of hours clearing the tracks and platforms,” said John Keefe, a Eurotunnel spokesman. The mayor of Calais has said troops may be needed to cope with the rising number of migrants trying to reach Britain. Natacha Bouchart said the population of the shanty camps had doubled to about 6,000 in recent weeks, adding that lawlessness in the camps was untenable. At least 15 people have died in or near the tunnel since the start of the cross-Channel migrant crisis at the beginning of the summer. One person died last week after being hit by a freight train at the Channel tunnel’s Coquelles terminal. The surge in migrants attempting to cross the Channel has led to increasing security at the terminal, including extra fencing and the deployment of more border force search and dog teams. “The groups in the camp consist of very intelligent people trying to work out how to overcome obstacles and outwit the police,” said Keefe. “These are the desperate throes of people as they see the exits closing. They will get through the fencing, either through, over or under. They are very resourceful. These 6,000 people have a single goal. We’re not convinced that the problem will ease over the winter as people are arriving in Calais via new routes in eastern Europe.” The Home Office said it had recently spent £7m on security measures at the Coquelles terminal and continued to work with the French authorities to monitor the situation. The EU has agreed a plan – resisted by Hungary and several other eastern European countries – to share out 120,000 refugees among its members, a small proportion of the 700,000 migrants the International Organisation for Migration expects to reach Europe’s borders from the Middle East, Africa and Asia this year. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, says more than 10,000 people are stranded in Serbia, with more on the way but nowhere to go."
2015-12-11T15:02:34Z,Banksy uses Steve Jobs artwork to highlight refugee crisis,"Banksy has revealed a new artwork, sprayed on a wall in the Calais refugee camp called “the Jungle”, intended to address negative attitudes towards the thousands of people living there. The work depicts the late Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, with a black bin bag thrown over one shoulder and an original Apple computer in his hand. The work is a pointed reference to Jobs’s background as the son of a Syrian migrant who went to America after the second world war. In a rare statement accompanying the work, Banksy said: “We’re often led to believe migration is a drain on the country’s resources but Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant. Apple is the world’s most profitable company, it pays over $7bn (£4.6bn) a year in taxes – and it only exists because they allowed in a young man from Homs.” The graffiti is one of a series of works Banksy has created in response to the refugee crisis. During his trip to Calais, the artist covered several walls across the French port with related graffiti, including a riff on Theodore Gericault’s Raft of the Medusa, featuring a luxury yacht. This summer, his temporary “bemusement” park in Weston-Super-Mare featured an installation of boats filled with bodies. On the closing night of Dismaland, Banksy also invited Pussy Riot to debut their song criticising the global failure to help the migrants entering Europe. Since the park closed in September, the artist has been shipping leftover infrastructure from Dismaland to help build emergency housing for the 7,000 migrants, mainly from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, now living on the site of a former rubbish tip in Calais. The “Dismal aid” project has seen site crew from the theme park build accommodation, community buildings and a children’s play area in the camp."
2015-05-05T21:45:39Z,Health screening program for refugee and migrant children under funding threat,"Serious illnesses in vulnerable refugee and migrant children risk going undetected if a New South Wales screening program fails to secure state government funding. The program, Optimising Health and Learning, is a partnership between schools and health services which screens children who have recently arrived to Australia for health issues that may hamper their education. The president of the program, Rob Lindsay, said he helped to establish the pilot program in 2011 when he was deputy principal of Menai high school using seed funding of $25,000 from the National Australia Bank’s school grants program. “It was so successful that in 2013 the project won the NSW premier’s public sector award and the NSW health innovations award,” Lindsay said. “Despite all this, government funding to secure the sustainability of the project has not been forthcoming and our funding will run out in June. “Without the project, between 1,000 and 1,200 refugee and vulnerable migrant children will be exited into mainstream high schools each year with an inhibited capacity to learn, because illnesses affecting their learning will not have been detected.” As part of the program, registered nurses conduct health checks on children attending intensive English language centresin preparation for high school. About 90% of refugee children and 75% of the migrant children screened through the program had at least one condition that needed treatment, Lindsay said. “There’s an urban myth out there that health screening of refugee and migrant children is done before or when they get to Australia, but to get a full, comprehensive health screening you have to be over 18,” Lindsay said. On arrival in Australia students and their families faced language or education barriers to accessing health care, which meant vision and hearing problems, diseases, and iron and vitamin deficiencies went undetected, he said. The NSW health minister, Jillian Skinner, told Guardian Australia the government recognised the importance of programs for newly arrived refugees and asylum seekers, but stopped short of saying the Optimising Heath and Learning program would be funded. “The NSW ministry of health is continuing to work ... to determine how the Optimising Health and Learning Program can complement the refugee health service in relation to child refugees and asylum seekers,” she said. Some health screening services are publicly available, but the engagement rate of refugees and vulnerable migrants was only 18%, compared with 100% of children targeted through the program, Lindsay said. He said after they received treatment, the learning ability and confidence of the students improved drastically. “A couple of years ago I had some teachers come up to me to say one of their 15-year-old students wasn’t learning, but it turned out he had vision problems and couldn’t see what they were teaching,” Lindsay said. “We organised some glasses for him and he came up to me one day and told me he had been able to watch a movie for the first time. “Another child’s teacher said he was out partying all night because he kept falling asleep in class. One day, I saw the child doubled over in pain. It turned out he had an undiagnosed spinal disease that kept him up all night in pain, and he couldn’t sleep.” A cost analysis of the program conducted by the Centre for Health Economics in 2013 found about 7% of students screened had a hearing impairment significant enough to require a specialist, despite only 4% reporting any problems with their hearing. The report found many children were unaware they were unwell. Migrant students were significantly less likely than refugee students to have visited a GP since their arrival to Australia, the report found. Professor David Isaacs, who runs the refugee clinic at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, said about 50% of children he saw in the clinic were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. “That can be stress related to what they witnessed or endured in their homeland, it can relate to a traumatic journey to Australia on a boat, it can relate to uncertainty about what their families face in future,” Isaacs said. “If you don’t deal with health problems related to stress, then it can have a lifelong effect on children and will impair their ability to learn, to relate to others and to contribute to society.” He said the Optimising Heath and Learning program should “absolutely” receive secure state government funding. “If we just assume everyone is all right once they arrive here then we are in for a rude shock,” he said. “We’ll have traumatised people with unaddressed health problems, which is bad for them, and bad for society.”"
2015-12-04T13:57:45Z,"EU risks being shaken apart by refugee crisis, warns Brussels","There must be a pan-European policy on migration and asylum, or risk the European Union falling apart, according to the EU’s top migration official. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Commission’s senior migration official, told a debate in Brussels on Thursday that the migration crisis is testing the values on which the EU was founded. During an EU committee of the regions debate on 3 December, Avramopoulos, mayor of Athens from 1995-2002, criticised the majority of European countries for failing to do enough to help refugees turning up on the continent’s shores after fleeing war, poverty and persecution. Just eight of the 28 EU member states who originally agreed to a fairer distribution of refugees have taken action to resettle people in their own countries, he said. Regions in the south and east of Europe have been left shouldering most of the burden in the influx of new arrivals. Not only does this test the EU principle of solidarity but also the principle of free movement, according to Avramopoulos. He added that the crisis could threaten the Schengen agreement for a borderless Europe, which he described as the EU’s biggest achievement. During the debate, the committee agreed to back the European commission’s agenda on migration, which calls for stronger border controls and a relocation system to resettle refugees across the EU. The committee, the EU’s assembly of local government representatives, has also called for far greater recognition of the role regional and local authorities can play in tackling the crisis, and direct access to European funding for integration and resettlement schemes. Avramopoulos said anyone resisting the arrival of migrants should remember that Europe is an ageing continent and needs to attract new people, as well as develop strategies to send home those who enter illegally. The confusion in terminology between refugees and economic migrants has caused problems, he said. “We must not listen to nationalists and to xenophobic groups that unfortunately are gaining more and more ground in Europe right now because this misconception exists.” The European parliament’s co-rapporteur on migration, Cécile Kashetu Kyenge, also lambasted the “short-sighted, egotistical policies of certain member states”. Kyenge, a Congolese-Italian politician and member of the European parliament, said the EU should promote a bottom-up approach that involved local authorities in planning and implementing migration policy. “It is up to them, in practice, to find a way to maintain social cohesion in their communities and to prevent social tensions and extremism,” she said. Some members of the committee voiced more hostile views on the crisis facing Europe. Anna Magyar, a Hungarian politician from Csongrád County, which shares a border with Serbia and has seen clashes between local authorities and refugees with police using tear gas and refugees declaring hunger strikes, said many of the migrants entering Europe were simply looking for a better standard of living. “It needs to be made absolutely clear that the boat is full,” she said. “Member states have obligations to their own citizens. When are we going to start protecting our own citizens against the massive flows of illegal migrants?” French politician François Decoster, who comes from Maire de Saint-Omer, about 40km north of Calais, said local authorities are much better placed to determine local need. Speaking to the Guardian, Decoster said the commissioner and French prime minister had visited his region to announce construction of 1,500 shelters. “At the time we had 3,000 people there. The number announced for building shelters was already insufficient,” he said. Decoster called for local authorities to be allowed to bypass their national governments and apply for direct funding from the EU. Each of the 28 EU member states has its own policy; this is one of the reasons why the situation at the border between France and England in Calais is so difficult to resolve, Decoster said. Decoster, who has been working on the Committee of the Regions’ (CoR) response to the European commission’s agenda on migration since the spring, said local and regional governments across Europe are given too little political say, too little funding and too little backing. “That must change,” he said. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of EU member states, praised CoR members for being at the frontline of European politics and dealing directly with the migrant influx. Tusk, the former Polish prime minister, dropped out of the plenary line-up, but in a recorded video message he told delegates that the EU faced existential threats and needed to decide “what kind of political community we are”.

2015-11-17T13:04:40Z,Students skip classes to show support for refugees,"Students across the country have been walking out of their lectures and classes in solidarity with what they see as the government’s poor treatment of refugees, migrants and international students. The National Union of Students’ international campaign, which organised the “day of solidarity”, has received backing from the University and College Union, the academic workers’ union and the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC). The protesters are using the hashtag #students4migrants on social media. Students at the London School of Economics (LSE) staged a mock border control point to show support for a world without borders. The LSE student union encouraged members to spend the day performing charitable work for refugee organisations. Damien Kemfack, international students officer at LSE’s student union, said: “With the highest percentage of international students in the country, the impact of a large number of participating LSE students should be tangibly felt.” Students at the Royal College of Arts demonstrated outside the Daily Mail’s headquarters in Kensington, west London, to protest against its stance on immigration. Miloslav Vorlíček, co-president of the RCA’s student union, said: “The Daily Mail is noted for a long history of anti-immigration headlines. We hope to shine a spotlight on this paper’s activities. Who knows, we might even convince one or two of its employees to walk away from the dark side!” Students at Goldsmiths, University of London, are showing their support for refugees throughout November. Daniel Nasr, education officer at its student union, said: “[Today’s protest] falls in line with November’s refugee awareness month where there are tens of other events surrounding the struggle of migrants worldwide.” The union will host an exhibition on asylum seeking in the UK, a performance by the Middle Eastern group 47Soul, charity fundraisers and panel discussions that will include students from Syria and other war-hit areas. Students in Essex, Sussex, Reading, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Plymouth, Cardiff, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere are also taking part in the day of protest. Mostafa Rajaai, international students’ officer at the NUS, said: “We want to send a clear message to the government that students in this country overwhelmingly reject the attitude and direction that the UK has adopted regarding immigration. “The failure to respond adequately to the refugee crisis, the mistreatment of international students and the constant attacks on migrants’ rights are all part of the wider anti-migrant sentiment which is on the rise in the UK political establishment.” Alex Norman, international student rep at the NCAFC, said: “The demand for free education is empty if it is not inclusive of migrants. We cannot solve the migrant crisis and anti-immigration rhetoric by making small changes, we can only put it off. We have to have clear demands for the destruction of borders, free movement and full support for migrants.” Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter."
2015-12-13T00:05:08Z,We need a stronger response to the refugee crisis | Yvette Cooper,"Calling for support for refugees has got harder. People across Britain want to help but, as winter draws in, the problems feel endless and the answers hard. A long shadow has been cast by the terrible Paris attacks. In France, Marine Le Pen and the Front National are on the rise. David Cameron has warned that anxiety over the refugee crisis could drive people towards Brexit. So it would be easy to conclude that the refugee crisis is just too difficult and that Britain should stay on the sidelines instead. But we can’t. The crisis isn’t going away and the Guardian and Observer are right to make this the subject of their Christmas appeal. For the sake of our common humanity, our social cohesion and security, we need a stronger response. For a start, more people are suffering as winter starts to bite. Tens of thousands of people in Greece and the Balkans are sleeping in the cold without proper shelter or sanitation. Closer to home, people are living in draughty tents in the rain and mud ofnorthern France. Medics I met in Calais this week say scabies and bronchitis are rife. I talked to 12-year-old Afghan boys alone with no parents or family, desperately vulnerable to trafficking gangs. Aid workers say Dunkirk is now worse – 2,000 Iraqi Kurds, half of them women and children, left by smugglers in an empty wasteground. Unless this crisis is properly managed, the escalating chaos is going to become ever more dangerous too. Gangs make a fortune trading in lives. Women and children are forced into the sex trade. Teenage boys are offered cheap passage if they will carry drugs or weapons. Terrorists can exploit the chaos too, travelling the same routes as the refugees who flee their violence. Our own safety and security depend on Europe getting a better grip. Nor should fear of the far right, or concern for social cohesion, stop us from acting. Because it is the sense of disorder and chaos that Le Pen and others exploit. At the same time Islamic State extremists want nothing more than to poison Europe’s hearts against refugees, to create the social tensions that make it easier for them to recruit. If we want to stop social cohesion being undermined, we need to show that governments can manage this crisis – restoring order and showing compassion at the same time. So what more does that mean Britain should be pressing for now? First, we need a major new co-ordinated humanitarian relief programme for Europe’s main crisis points – led by the UNHCR. In places such as Lesbos, Idomeni, Calais or Dunkirk, small groups of volunteers do their best, but the biggestproblem is lack of leadership to co-ordinate the relief. Second, we need a proper system of assessments to see who needs support and who should be returned home. It still isn’t happening on Lesbos. And if the French won’t do it in Calais, we should insist the UNHCR are brought in instead. Third, we need stronger controls and security assessments to prevent criminals and extremists exploiting the crisis. Schengen should be ditched and border checks within Europe restored. Finally, we need more action to prevent people starting dangerous journeys. That includes support for refugees in the region, and work to end the Syrian conflict. But it also means developing safe and managed alternatives to the current chaos.For example Britain should give sanctuary to some of the abandoned child refugees just as we helped with the Kindertransport. And we should help more refugee families who have been torn apart. The single mother I met in Calais who fled Syria with two small children after her husband was killed is desperate to reach her closest remaining relatives, her father and brother, who live in London. We should prevent families like hers travelling to Calais with a proper legal system they can apply to instead. None of this is easy. But ignoring the problem or hoping other countries will solve it will only make it worse. This is the biggest humanitarian challenge Europe has faced since the second world war. We have no choice but to act."
2015-11-27T15:53:42Z,EU seeks to buy Turkish help with migrants at controversial summit,"European leaders are to stage an unprecedented and highly controversial summit with the Turkish government on Sunday in an attempt to outsource the migration crisis, paying Ankara €3bn for it to seal its border with Greece to halt or slow migrant flows to Europe. The Turks, who demanded the summit, have insisted on a high price fortheir cooperation: the resumption of EU membership negotiations after years of them being frozen, easing of visa requirements for Turks travelling to the EU, regular EU-Turkey summits, and the €3bn (£2.1bn) in aid over two years. “The amount of money we’re offering is ludicrous,” said an ambassador from one of the bigger countries in the EU. “We’re on our knees begging the Turks to close their border.” The sentiment is widespread among policymakers in Brussels and EU capitals, with scepticism high about the merits of trying to strike a deal with Turkey’s authoritarian and mercurial president, Recep Tayipp Erdoğan, who has been criticised for his human rights record. Another two journalists were arrested in Turkey this week after publishing reports about Turkish arms supplies to jihadis in Syria. “Do you know anyone who believes Erdoğan will deliver?” asked another senior diplomat, while a top EU policymaker said the EU was “trapped”. But the strategy of buying Turkish cooperation in the refugee crisis is being driven by domestic politics in several EU countries, most notably Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel cannot be seen to back down publicly on her open-door policy towards immigrants, but needs some respite in the form of slowing down the flow and gaining some control over the chaos. Erdoğan, Berlin believes, can supply that political safety valve. The EU has never held a full summit of 28 leaders with another non-member country. It is doing so only because Ankara insisted. Even more confusingly and embarrassingly, it remained unclear on Friday morning who would represent Ankara – Erdoğan or the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu. It would be the latter, it was later confirmed. The European commission has drawn up the policy in a hurry in recent weeks on Germany’s behalf. It is not clear where the €3bn will come from and negotiations in Brussels on the funding have barely begun. Britain, seldom the first to offer money for European projects, is the only country in the EU to have made a concrete pledge of €400m, while €500m is earmarked to come from the EU budget, leaving more than €2bn to be raised. Turkey is hosting more than 2 million Syrian refugees and it is the biggest source of migrants into the EU, with about 700,000 crossing the Aegean into Greece and then trekking across the Balkans this year. “This is not money for Turkey. It’s money for the refugees,” Federica Mogherini, the EU’s chief foreign policy coordinator, told the Guardian. “You have to support the communities there or you face social collapse.” The proposed deal with Ankara would see the Turks patrolling the Aegean borders to the Greek islands to stem the flow of migrants, cracking down on the smuggling mafias running the trade, but would also at a later stage entail the EU agreeing to take hundreds of thousands of bona fide refugees annually from Turkey and resettle them across Europe. The figure mentioned in Berlin is 500,000 per year. They would be shared under a new system of permanent, binding EU quotas, according to Merkel. This would trigger a colossal row in the EU, with several countries reluctant to pay Turkey and even less keen to accept the quotas. Merkel warned this week that Europe’s 26-country free-travel zone, known as Schengen, would not survive unless she got her way. According to senior diplomats, EU policymakers have concluded that Schengen will be in its terminal phase within months unless European governments gain greater control over the pace and scale of immigration from the Middle East."

2015-08-31T15:42:33Z,Why I swam across the Mediterranean in solidarity with refugees | Nina Hall,"Last Friday, I swam from Turkey to Greece in solidarity with the refugees who are making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean into Europe. I crossed from Kaş, a Turkish resort town where European tourists flock in the summer, into Greek waters near Kastellorizo, a Greek island 5km kilometres off the coast of Turkey. The crossing is near where many refugees have crossed the Mediterranean in recent months. The situation here is tense. Earlier in August, refugees were locked in a stadium on Kos and the Greek government sent riot police to deal with refugee protests. So why did I do this swim? I was motivated, first, by a deep concern that thousands of people are drowning off the coast of Italy and Libya, being tear-gassed in Macedonia, blocked by razor wire on the Hungarian border. I am concerned that many European governments are responding with force to people who have risked everything for the sake of survival. Many have faced brutal conflict in Syria or repressive governments in Eritrea. I talked with a Syrian refugee in Berlin who described getting on a small, overloaded boat in the Aegean last August. He left at midnight, and during the crossing the boat filled with water and there was no way of bailing it out. Those on board were saved by Greek authorities. Thousands of others have not been so fortunate. I am also driven by my own research on the evolution of global refugee and migration governance. In times of great need for Europe, the rest of the world was willing to take European refugees and migrants. Let’s rewind 70 years, when Europe was devastated by war and had massive refugee populations. What did the world do? In 1950, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was created and the Refugee Convention was established the following year; thousands of European refugees were then accepted on to the soil of other states. These institutions oblige states to offer protection and assistance to refugees. A lesser-known fact: the Refugee Convention was meant only for refugees fleeing persecution in European countries; it was created to help Europe. In fact, it was only in 1967 that the limited geographic scope was removed and people from Africa, Asia and the Americas could also be considered refugees. Today, the Refugee Convention legally obliges Europe to offer protection and assistance to all those entering its territory. Refugees cannot be returned to their country of origin. After the second world war, Latin America, North America, Australia and New Zealand also accepted European migrants. In 1951 the US established what became the International Organisation for Migration, which helped people migrate from southern Europe to Australia and the Americas. In fact, European migrants have for centuries benefited from being able to move offshore. In the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of migrants left the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Greece. Some fled persecution or famine – think of the millions of Irish people who emigrated after the potato famine. Some looked for better job opportunities in cities from Sydney to Chicago. What is overlooked in current debates is how much Europe benefited from the creation of global refugee and migration institutions after the war and the openness of other countries to accept refugees and migrants. Europe should do the same today. I am driven by a hope that those of us living in Europe will view refugees as beneficial to society. European leaders should view this “crisis” as an opportunity to benefit from refugees’ skills. Europe needs workers, skilled and unskilled (migrants and refugees often do the jobs that no other locals want to do), and the people coming to Europe today have many assets. Research suggests that migration generally has a positive effect on economic growth. The Syrian refugee I met in Berlin had studied English literature and was planning to pursue tertiary studies at Wing’s, which offers online university courses free to refugees. His brother is a dental technician and last week began working in Berlin. My swim from Turkey to Greece was only a few kilometres long, and nothing compared to the distance, uncertainties and challenges that many refugees face on their way to Europe. European leaders should realise that refugees are far from being just a burden to taxpayers, but bring great benefits. European governments also have a legal and moral responsibility to assist refugees. They are legally obliged to do so by the Refugee Convention and by the historical record. Europe and its people once benefitted enormously from others’ openness – now it’s time European leaders stopped using force, opened up Europe’s borders, and all of us living in Europe welcomed refugees."
2015-08-31T16:47:53Z,Italian politicians seize on asylum seeker's alleged role in murder,"The brutal murder of an elderly couple in Sicily has become a political issue in Italy following the arrest of an African asylum seeker who was allegedly implicated in the killings. The accused killer, 18-year-old Mamadou Kamara from the Ivory Coast, has been a resident of the Mineo refugee centre in Sicily – the largest such facility in Europe – since 8 June. According to Italian media reports, Kamara was arrested on Sunday after he was found entering Mineo with a bag containing a phone that allegedly belonged to the victims. His pants were allegedly stained with blood. One victim, Victor Solano, 68, was found in his nearby home with his throat slit and his Spanish wife, Mercedes Ibanez, 70, was found in the courtyard of the couple’s apartment building, having apparently fallen from the balcony. The daughter of the victims, Rosita Solano, blamed the Italian government for the murders, saying it allowed “immigrants to come here and do what they want, even rob and kill us”. She singled out the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, and interior minister, Angelino Alfano, who have resisted political pressure from some critics to stop saving tens of thousands of migrants who have attempted the treacherous crossing from northern Africa to Italy’s southern shore. “Renzi, come here and explain it to me,” she said in a video interview with La Repubblica. Anti-immigrant politicians, led by Matteo Salvini, the head of the rightwing Northern League, seized on the remarks. “From what war was this guy escaping??? If he’s guilty, jail for life, with HARD LABOUR!,” Salvini said on Twitter and his Facebook page. He called for the immediate closure of the migrant centre in Mineo. Another rightwing politician from the Fratelli d’Italia party called on Renzi to explain himself to the victims’ daughter, saying the Mineo migrant reception centre was not properly monitored. The mayor of Palagonia, where the murders took place, took a more measured tone, saying more police patrols were needed “migrants or not”, because the area required more security. More than 100,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Italy this year, tens of thousands of whom have been rescued by Italian and other European rescue crews. Migrants generally have not faced a hostile reception in Italy, but there have been some incidents over the past few months of violence and antagonism against the new arrivals provoked by unsubstantiated claims the migrants are violent and dangerous. The murders in Sicily are likely to fuel anger and concern among some Italians who say the wave of new migrants poses a domestic security risk. The political tensions in Italy come as EU interior and justice ministers said they would meet in two weeks in Brussels to find “concrete steps” to cope with the escalating migration issue. Renzi said on Sunday that he believed the EU would adopt a set of uniform rules for refugees, replacing a patchwork of laws."
2015-11-12T13:37:48Z,Sweden introduces border checks as refugee crisis grows,"Sweden is introducing border checks for the first time since the start of the refugee crisis, hours after its prime minister asked European counterparts at a high-level migration conference in Malta to do more to help his country and Germany care for refugees arriving on the continent. Swedish police will monitor trains and ferries arriving from mainland Europe and stop anyone without valid travel documents. Officials stressed that anyone seeking to apply for asylum in Sweden would not be turned back, and said the intention is to deter those hoping to cross Sweden to reach other Scandinavian countries, and to create a more orderly process of arrival for refugees. “If they come to the border and request asylum, then we will process their request, but if they have no desire to stay, then that’s a question for the police,” a spokeswoman for Sweden’s migration agency, Migrationsverket, said. Under the previous system, refugees could simply take the train or ferry to Sweden and enter the country unobstructed – a laissez-faire situation that its prime minister now says constitutes a threat to security. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday, Stefan Löfven said: “If you don’t have good control of who is coming here – what people are actually entering the county – that is a risk.” Sweden is proportionally bearing the biggest burden of the European migration crisis, with 10,000 asylum-seekers arriving every week, and no more short-term space to house them. Migration officials expect the country to absorb at least 170,000 asylum seekers by the end of the year, within a total population of 10 million. Britain, with a population of more than 60 million, has pledged to receive 4,000 Syrian refugees in the same period. Löfven said other EU countries needed to step up their response to the refugee crisis, so that the burden was not only left to Sweden and Germany. “I’ve been mentioning burden sharing for a long time,” Löfven told Today. “It is not sustainable that one country, or two countries, take the vast part of the responsibility. All European countries need to take responsibility. If the European Union can’t handle this situation, it’s serious.” Other European countries have been extremely slow to react to the scale of the crisis. EU leaders have convened several conferences, such as Thursday’s gathering in Malta, but little has been achieved at them. Politicians took months to agree to even a modest quota system that would see less than a quarter of refugee arrivals shared between the EU’s members, leaving the majority of the burden to countries like Sweden and Germany. On Thursday, the deputy head of the EU border agency Frontex said EU countries had failed to provide it with the resources and personnel it needed to deal with the record influx of migrants entering the EU. “Up until now, member states have only committed 40% of the resources we asked for,” Gil Arias told Spanish daily El Mundo. In October the agency turned to the European commission, formally requesting more personnel for operations in Greece and the Balkans, but received little response, he said. The lack of resources, said Arias, has left Frontex in a tricky situation. “Often enormous expectations are generated over what the agency can do,” he said, noting that the agency had unofficially shifted its mandate in recent months from patrolling EU coastlines to carrying out daily rescues of migrants. “Frontex was not created to replace member states when it comes to rescue and border patrol, but rather to help them.” The burden on Sweden has left the country struggling to find enough beds for its new residents, and has led to internal division about its asylum policies. The far-right Swedish Democrat party has called for the country to end its generosity, while the government argues that its high humanitarian standards should be maintained at all costs, and blames its domestic crisis on the negligence of other countries. “The big problem is in Europe,” Fredrik Bengtsson, spokesman for Migrationsverket, said. “There are so many different asylum systems. In Sweden we have one system, in Hungary they have another, so of course [refugees] are making the rational decision about where they want to go. “The key for this question is not for Sweden to lower their standards, it’s for other people to raise theirs.”"
2015-12-06T18:01:01Z,Greece to set up island screening centres to ease refugee crisis,"Greece has enacted emergency legislation to facilitate the registration of the large number of refugees entering the country days after seeking help to reinforce its borders from the EU. Deflecting withering criticism that it has not done enough to deal with the crisis, the government unveiled plans to establish five hotspots, or screening centres, on outlying Aegean islands where some 660,000 migrants and refugees have arrived this year. The law, published in the government gazette early on Saturday, took many by surprise. Local authorities on islands such as Kos have long claimed the establishment of such centres will only attract more refugees. In a strongly worded statement, the Kos branch of the main opposition conservative New Democracy party said the decision would lead with “mathematical precision” to the destruction of the island’s tourist industry. Greece was reportedly threatened with suspension from the passport-free Schengen zone last week following mounting EU dissatisfaction with its inability to control its borders and its management of migrant reception centres. In a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, the bloc’s health commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, said he had been appalled by conditions on Lesbos, where the lack of emergency care was such that babies were dying of hypothermia. The threat caught Athens’ leftist-led government off-guard but also appears to have goaded it into action: Saturday’s surprise move came less than 24 hours after European interior ministers met to discuss the measures now needed to improve the flow of refugees from Greece to the EU. The northern frontier the country shares with Macedonia has been the site of chaotic scenes since the former Yugoslav republic began erecting a fence and blocking entrance to anyone not deemed to be a migrant from a conflict zone. “The possibility of being kicked out of Schengen set off alarm bells,” said one well-placed insider. “With the country’s economic crisis it would have sent a terrible signal to investors.” Extra guards from Europe’s border agency, Frontex, and emergency supplies are expected to arrive in Greece this week. Under EU legislation usually enacted to cope with natural disasters, officials said tents, generators and other equipment would be flown in to help Greece accommodate people over the winter. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ coalition, in power with the small rightwing Independent Greeks party, denied it had previously rejected the offer of the assistance. Despite Turkey’s promise to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Greece following a landmark agreement between Ankara and the EU last week, busloads of new arrivals continued on Sunday to make their way to the Macedonian frontier. “Tensions have eased a bit but they are still coming,” Alexandros Voulgaris, an official with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, based in Idomeni said. “Only today 1,500 arrived here. They all want to continue their journey [through the Balkans] into Europe.”"
2015-12-10T11:12:52Z,"Migration is not worth the risk, says Syrian man whose family drowned","A Syrian man whose wife and seven children drowned as they attempted to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to mainland Europe has warned other refugees that the risks of migration are not worth taking. Ali Alsaho and his family had been fleeing Islamic State militants in Deir el-Zour, eastern Syria, when the engine of the boat they were travelling on failed near the coastal town of Çeşme in western Turkey last month. Alsaho was the only member of the family to survive. His wife and children, who were aged between nine and 20 days old, all drowned. Speaking through tears, Alsaho told the BBC that smugglers had told his family they would not need life jackets because the boat was safe. “I had the most affectionate wife. I took my family out of Syria to escape the killing. My children could have had a future in Europe. Now I have lost my family, my world,” he said. Asked what advice he had for other refugees considering the perilous journey to Europe, Alsaho said: “I would say don’t take this risk. Don’t go by sea. You will lose your children. The smugglers are traitors. They said we would reach Greece within 15 minutes. I advise everyone: don’t come, stay in Syria, however difficult it is.” The bodies of some of Alsaho’s children, as well as his wife, have not yet been recovered. Their tragic story is not uncommon – this week, another group of migrants, including six Afghan children, drowned after a rubber dinghy carrying them to Greece sank in the Aegean. They are among more than 3,500 people who have died or been reported missing this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. Turkey is under international pressure to help stem the flow of migrants. Ankara has stepped up a crackdown on people smuggling, arresting thousands of refugees, after it promised to curb the flow of refugees to Greece in exchange for financial aid from the EU. The EU’s pledge of €3bn (£2.1bn) in aid for the 2.2 million Syrians now in Turkey is intended to raise living standards and persuade migrants to stay in the country rather than attempt the journey to the EU via the Greek islands. “As Turkey is making an effort to take in refugees – who will not come to Europe – it’s reasonable that Turkey receive help from Europe to accommodate those refugees,” the French president, François Hollande, said at the time. As part of the deal, Ankara was also offered a “re-energised” negotiating process on Turkish membership of the EU, as well as visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen zone for Turkish nationals. David Cameron said: “We need a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis in Europe and obviously that involves Turkey.” Meanwhile, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, recently told the Guardian that refugees arriving in Europe should be detained for up to 18 months in holding centres across the EU while they are screened for security and terrorism risks. Hollande has said a deal with Turkey should make it easier to check migrants arriving and keep out those who pose a threat."
2015-11-05T11:45:48Z,Comedians stand up for refugees,"What do comedians do when they see heart-breaking images of children drowning trying to reach Europe? They put on a stand-up show of course. Greg Davies, UK sitcom and panel-show lynchpin, gives the one-liners a pause while explaining why he was inspired to get a group together of his most famous comedian friends to raise money for refugees. “It was as simple as seeing the news coverage of refugees fleeing war-torn areas,” says Davies, who has starred in The Inbetweeners and Man Down. “What else can you do as a comedian but do some comedy to raise money to help?” The benefit includes some of comedy’s biggest names - Jo Brand, Roisin Conaty, Russell Howard, Reginald D Hunter, Dara O’Briain and Jack Whitehall – and is raising money for ActionAid and UNHCR. “The UN and agencies like ActionAid are incredibly stretched,” says Davies, adding that he hasn’t “got a clue” how to solve the crisis. “I think you have to hand that over to professionals who know what they’re talking about. We’re just trying to raise a little bit of extra money for basic provisions for all of these thousands of people.” Davies put the gig together with children’s TV presenter Ed Petrie, who saw the extent of the migrant crisis for himself in Serbia. “Seeing something like this up close, all these people in their jeans, T-shirts and trainers JUST LIKE ME, but living my worst nightmare – meant that once I got home I was bending the ear of anyone who would listen,” Petrie says. The team thinks now is the right time for a gig, as the weather turns colder and crossing the Mediterranean becomes more perilous. The public outcry, donation drives and grassroots fundraising in reaction to the crisis has impressed Davies. “It restores your faith in human nature when you see the response from the British public,” he says. “The negativity that you receive on social media when you announce you’re doing something like this is minimal, and clearly from people who are not thinking straight. The vast majority of people are delighted to support something like this. It’s heartwarming.” The comedian is aware that raising several thousand pounds at a comedy gig is “a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed”, but hopes the show will be the beginning of something bigger. “All of us who are involved in this are aware that it’s a very meagre offering, but it’s something. And I hope we’ll go on to do other things. It feels like the start of something rather than a one-off.” Greg Davies, Jo Brand, Roisin Conaty, Russell Howard, Reginald D Hunter, Dara O’Briain and Jack Whitehall are performing at Stand up for Action at the Hammersmith Apollo on Wednesday 11 November.

2015-12-09T16:38:56Z,"Greece buses 2,000 refugees from border camp to Athens","Greece has dispersed more than 2,000 refugees who were stuck for weeks in a camp near the Macedonian border, as the EU announced that over 1 million people had now claimed asylum within its borders since the start of the year. Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis continue to be allowed into Macedonia and the Balkans, but people of other nationalities, who make up roughly 10% of the total number, have been stopped at the border since early November. Instead of returning to Athens, many of them set up camp for several weeks – and several sewed shut their mouths – leading to Wednesday’s dispersal. In separate developments, the EU said it had received at least 1 million asylum seekers in 2015, a figure that includes refugees who have crossed the Mediterranean as well as internal European migrants from Kosovo and Albania. It does not include numbers from the latest surge in maritime arrivals; on Wednesday 11 people were confirmed to have drowned in the Atlantic Ocean during an attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands by boat from west Africa. In northern Greece, an activist and an aid worker said hundreds of Greek police arrived in the morning to disperse the camp, which includes asylum seekers from warring countries such as Somalia, as well as peaceful ones like Morocco. The vast majority went without protest, though some Iranians held a short demonstration at around midday, before being bussed back to Athens in a convoy of around 50 coaches. “We haven’t seen any violence and we haven’t treated anybody for violence,” said Constance Theisen, a representative of Médecins Sans Frontières, which has been working in the area since the spring. Aid workers are now preparing for chaotic scenes in Athens, where the rejected asylum seekers were due to spend the night in two stadiums, and where officials and campaigners have not decided on a joint strategy. “At the moment, you have IOM [the International Organisation for Migration] promoting voluntary returns [to their home countries],” said Theisen. “And you have UNHCR [the UN refugee agency] telling people how to apply for asylum.” Other observers speculate that those who have been returned to Athens will not remain for long, with many expected to try to reach northern Europe via Bulgaria or Albania instead. “Let’s wait for the new route, because we will see it soon,” said Vasilis Tsartsanis, an activist who has been working on the Macedonian border for more than a year. “They will go again to the mafia and the smugglers.” Meanwhile, the bodies of 11 migrants attempting to reach Spain’s Canary Islands by boat were recovered on Tuesday, the latest victims of a perilous migration route that appears to be regaining popularity with sub-Saharan migrants desperate to make it to Europe. The 11 were believed to be on a small boat packed with 39 people that set off from Western Sahara two days earlier, in the hope of making it across the treacherous stretch of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the Canary Islands from west Africa. Moroccan authorities said the boat capsized after it ran into poor weather conditions. There were no reports on the whereabouts of the others on the boat. It was the third boat attempting the crossing in as many days. On Sunday, the Spanish coastguard rescued 51 people making the journey, and on Monday another 47 people. The crossings represent a small revival in attempts to reach one of Europe’s southernmost outposts. Rough estimates suggest that more than 400 people have arrived in the Spanish archipelago since the start of the year, up from 296 in 2014 – the highest annual total since 2009. Some 270 migrants and refugees arrived in September and October alone. The numbers arriving on the islands nevertheless remain a far cry far from those in 2006, when more than 31,000 migrants arrived in the Canary Islands. Hundreds of others drowned or died of thirst and exposure while attempting the journey, which can take up to two weeks. At the time, Spanish authorities responded to the surge by increasing coastguard patrols and signing repatriation agreements with several African countries. The number of migrants dropped substantially, to as low as 196 in 2013, according to Spain’s interior ministry. Many migrants instead tried their luck on the triple razor-wire fence that lines the borders of the Spanish enclave of Melilla, which more than 2,000 migrants and refugees managed to scale in 2014. In response, Spanish authorities added a fine layer of mesh to make it tougher to climb and passed a controversial law allowing border guards to forcibly return anyone who makes it over the fence to Morocco. The number of migrants making across the fence this year has since dropped to around 100 people."
2015-12-03T16:55:33Z,Pakistan sends deported migrants back to Greece,"Thirty-one migrants made a round trip from Greece to Pakistan on Thursday after the government in Islamabad said the EU had illegally deported them. Although 19 out of the 50 deportees who came in on a charter plane were taken into custody in Pakistan, the remainder stayed on board for almost two hours before returning to Greece after the government said they did not have the correct paperwork. It was the latest salvo in a row between the EU and Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the Pakistani interior minister angry about the treatment of his compatriots by European states struggling with a migrant crisis. “Pakistani laws have been violated, which absolutely cannot be allowed,” Khan said in a statement. The issue has been a running source of tension with the EU. In early November Khan suspended an agreement on readmitting illegal detainees, saying two EU states were sending Pakistanis home on “baseless terrorism charges”. “Those who give lectures on fundamental rights to us should also respect fundamental rights of Pakistanis,” he said at the time. Last week Dimitris Avramopoulos, a Greek politician and the EU commissioner responsible for migration policy, visited Pakistan to try to soothe concerns. But on Thursday Pakistan said the EU was still not honouring pledges to only return those whose identity had been confirmed, saying the men flown back to Greece were “unverified deportees”. The EU office in Islamabad said all 50 people on the flight organised by Frontex, the agency in charge of Europe’s borders, had been given passports to travel by the Pakistani embassies in Greece, Bulgaria and Austria. It said Pakistan’s demand that the migrants should also have their national identity card numbers was impossible for EU officials to organise and that it was not part of the agreement struck with Pakistan. “The list of names [of the deportees] had been sent to the Pakistani authorities earlier, providing sufficient time to the relevant Pakistani authorities to find the missing numbers for the returnees,” the EU said. Last year, about 21,000 Pakistanis who were in Europe without permission were ordered to return home. An estimated 50,000 Pakistanis travel legally to Europe for work each year. Clashes erupted on the Greek-Macedonian border on Tuesday when Macedonian police fired teargas to repel hundreds of mostly Pakistani migrants trying to push through a new border fence. Some of them later blocked the crossing for Syrians and others who would have been let in as war refugees. “If we don’t cross, no one does!” they chanted."
2015-12-02T16:37:28Z,"Guardian refugee appeal reaches £300,000","We have hit the £300,000 mark in our refugee appeal. Thank you, readers! It’s an unprecedented response to our charity appeal, and we have raised this huge amount faster than in any previous year. In fact, with your help, we have raised 549% more than we raised at the same point last year. Some of our readers have got in touch to tell us why they are donating, revealing a variety of compelling reasons: they disagree with what they see as inaction by the government, they don’t think they need the state winter fuel allowance they receive, or they were just very moved by accounts of the humanitarian crisis. Michael Bassey wrote: I’ve just donated my ‘winter fuel £300’ which I get as an octogenarian from our government. My house is warm enough this winter but I grieve for the cold times facing refugees from tyrannical regimes. They need our help. Other readers also said they were donating their winter fuel allowance to charity. One donor wrote: “I passed on my winter fuel allowance. There’s a pleasing irony in refugees being supported by the Department for Work and Pensions.” Martin Harrison, another generous donor, believes we have a moral duty to help. He wrote: We are very lucky and should be doing all we can to assist. After all our government contributed significantly to the wars in Iraq, Libya and Syria by their indiscriminate support of rebel groups, particularly in the supply of arms. I believe I have a responsibility to try to make amends for those government actions that have contributed to causing the refugee crisis. One anonymous donor, deeply frustrated by demeaning language used in discussing the refugee crisis, wrote: This government is so utterly mean spirited, there are many organisations needing support more than ever. The language used by ministers when referring to refugees is so often demeaning and intended to provoke anxieties in Britons so that they will more likely support the government’s harsh approach to those in dire need. Daphne Charles wished everyone could sleep in safety: When I lie in my comfortable bed at night, in my modest house safe from the elements, I wish everyone could have the same for themselves and their families. Another donor echoed this feeling. “I have never before felt such anguish for the plight of people enduring such suffering,” Alison Down wrote, adding: “I was born in 1939 and as I grew up became used to what were stories from adults, but this is happening now in our midst.” Please support our charity appeal. Donate here. Tell us why you care about our refugee appeal, and get involved in the conversation with the hashtag #WeStandTogether."
2015-09-16T17:59:00Z,Refugees welcome? Not this one,"Last week, in an article about families offering their spare rooms to asylum seekers, G2 featured on its cover a man called Muhammad Sajjad. The 30-year-old from Pakistan had been staying in the spare room of Yoshiko Stokoe and her partner Jack Palmer and with another couple in Leeds. He had since left their home, having begun to receive an asylum seeker’s allowance of just over £5 a day on a prepaid card, along with a room in a shared house, paid for by the Home Office. He was trying to manage his mental health after a number of suicide attempts and was waiting for his solicitor to put together an application for judicial review challenging a decision from the Home Office in May to refuse him asylum. By coincidence, the day the article was published, Sajjad was arrested and taken to Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre in west London. He has now been told he has no right to stay and will be sent back on 21st September to Pakistan, where he claims to fear for his life. Stokoe says the Home Office has refused to consider expert evidence from Antislavery International, which said that Sajjad exhibited all the signs of someone who had been trafficked into slavery. Sajjad has also been issued with a letter from his GP, which says that he suffers “long-standing severe and enduring mental health issues” which could not be treated in Pakistan and advises that he is not fit to fly. Sajjad’s story is complicated, but runs essentially as follows: he says that 13 years ago, his family decided he should leave Pakistan, after being beaten up and left for dead because of his father’s political allegiances. Traffickers charged the family the equivalent of £12,000, promising to get him a chef’s visa, accommodation and medical care so that he could work as a sweet chef in a curry house earning £16,000 a year. But when he arrived in Britain in 2006, he found himself forced into domestic slavery. Sajjad then spent six or seven months homeless and destitute before discovering that he could try to claim asylum. The kindness shown to him by Stokoe, Palmer and others in Leeds allowed him to try to get back on track as he got his asylum claim together. “Muhammad dreams of safety and stability in his life; of having a home to welcome people to; of one day opening a restaurant and using his skills as a chef,” said Stokoe. She asks well-wishers to visit keepmuhammadsafe.wordpress.com, the website they have set up, which has suggestions of how to help."
2015-11-28T07:00:01Z,Refugees tell a different Berlin story,"On a chilly winter’s day in Berlin, it’s hard to imagine how Oranienplatz looked 18 months ago. From October 2012 to April 2014, the tree-lined square in Kreuzberg was the heartland of the German refugee movement, occupied by refugees and activists in protest at the state’s asylum policy. Now it’s gone back to being a largely unassuming urban space, but for those who lived there in that time, the square still holds significant meaning. “It’s beautiful,” says Mohamed, a Sudanese refugee who arrived in Europe four years ago. “And it was the place where we had people we could meet and communicate with.” His story forms part of the Refugee Voices tour, a new initiative giving visitors and Berlin residents the chance to hear first-hand the experiences of refugees. The tour, launched last month, is a collaboration between local guide and refugee activist Lorna Cannon, Mohamed and fellow refugee Moha. They hope that by next spring they will have more refugees involved. A Syrian-led tour about coming to Germany is also being planned. “We were already telling stories, giving tours to newly arrived refugees,” Moha tells me. “But tourists kept asking us about what had happened. We felt the best way was if we told it.” We hear about the pair’s journey to Germany. Moha’s passage from Somalia cost him $18,000: a family member sold two properties to raise the money. Mohamed travelled by boat from Libya to Italy in 2011. He sits on the floor, legs apart, to demonstrate the way refugees were crammed together on boats for days at a time. Their legs would stop working, which is why so many drowned if they fell in the water. While the tours are an opportunity to hear incredible stories that most people only read about in the news, the tours also have a political aim: to preserve and acknowledge the birth of the refugee community in Berlin. Our guides tell the story of the Oranienplatz occupation, including how the tents were eventually cleared by police. Sudanese refugee Napuli Langa climbed a tree in the square and spent a week on hunger strike as the police closed in. We move on to a former school on Ohlauer Strasse, which was occupied after the clearing of Oranienplatz. The authorities evicted most residents from there, too, in dramatic scenes involving riot police and refugees threatening to jump from the roof. Now it is an official refugee centre. Mohamed is the only one of the 25 original residents still living there. Nearby Gorlitzer Park is best-known as a place to score drugs, but it is another important social spot for refugees in the city. When the tour ends, we’re invited for lunch with a weekly cooking group for refugees, run by Give Something Back to Berlin, which was founded in 2013 to bring together all visitors to the city – be they short- or long-term, privileged tourist or refugee. As I warm up with a generous portion of the group’s Sudanese curry, Mohamed tells me what the tours mean to him: “Living in the school, you’re in isolation. The conditions aren’t good and no one can visit. So when I get a chance to tell people what I feel inside, I have a good feeling.” He points to his chest. “I relax somehow.” • Refugee Voices tours run at 2pm on Saturdays, starting at Oranienplatz, payment by donation, facebook.com/refugeevoicestours"
2015-12-14T12:52:12Z,Angela Merkel pledges to cut German immigration figures but rejects limit,"Angela Merkel has promised to “tangibly” reduce the number of refugees and migrants entering Germany in an attempt to quell a rebellion in her conservative ranks, but rejected calls to impose a cap on immigration. At a gathering of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Merkel said Germany would pursue a range of measures to stem the flow of asylum seekers, expected to reach about 1 million this year. “Even a strong country like Germany would in the long run be unable to cope with such a large number of refugees,” the chancellor said in a one-hour long speech. “We want to tangibly reduce the number of refugees arriving. With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.” However, she said Germany had a “moral and political” duty as Europe’s top economic power to continue to help desperate people, particularly those from war-ravaged Syria. “We will live up to our humanitarian responsibility,” she said. “The refugee crisis is a historic test for Europe, which I am convinced it will pass. Even if everything we do in Europe is interminably arduous” After weeks of increasingly vocal dissent from the right wing of the CDU, many commentators had expected the party conference in Karlsruhe to be the stage for a showdown between Merkel and her critics. Instead, Merkel emerged from the gathering largely unchallenged, with an overwhelming majority of delegates voting in support of her roadmap for dealing with the refugee crisis. Only two delegates voted in favour against her proposals. She drew loud applause as she repeated her rallying cry: “We can do it.” A nine-minute standing ovation was brought to a close by the chancellor herself telling the 1,000 delegates that “we still have work to do”. Having effectively squashed any rebellion over upper limits on arrivals before the party conference, Merkel still sought to address lingering concerns over the long-term consequences of the refugee crisis. “Those who seek refuge with us also have to respect our laws and traditions, and learn to speak German,” she said. “Multiculturalism leads to parallel societies, and therefore multiculturalism remains a grand delusion.” Her comments echoed a similar statement from 2010, when Merkel said multiculturalism had “utterly failed”. Merkel appealed to the party’s sense of history, saying that the same strength that allowed it “to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle, and to go from division to a reunified country”, would get Germany through the refugee crisis. Merkel condemned rich countries for failing to properly fund the UN refugee agency and World Food Programme, saying this was unforgivable. Before an EU summit this week, Merkel said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut refugee numbers, urging stronger protection for the bloc’s external borders, support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states. She touted a range of measures currently being undertaken in Germany, including extending a list of safe countries of origin, expediting repatriation of rejected asylum seekers and increasing staff levels to help process applicants. Germany is divided roughly down the middle by the refugee issue, with a poll on Friday showing 49% opposed Merkel’s stance while 47% supported it. The CDU is polling at about 39%, 2.5 points off its performance in the 2013 general election and far ahead of the SPD on 24%."
2015-10-26T07:55:44Z,"EU and Balkans agree plan for 100,000 places in reception centres for refugees","European Union and Balkan leaders meeting in Brussels have agreed a 17-point plan to cooperate on managing the flows of refugees making their way through Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans in a bid to reach places such as Germany and Scandinavia before winter. The European commission said that among the measures agreed between the 11 nations were that 100,000 places in reception centres should be made available along the route from Greece towards Germany, half in Greece and half in the countries to the north. The UN refugee agency would help establish them. The leaders also agreed that the EU border agency Frontex would step up its activities on the Greek-Macedonian border to ensure that people trying to cross would be registered. “We have made very clear that the policy of simply waving people through must be stopped,” Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission’s president, told reporters, referring to agreements to cooperate and avoid unilateral national measures that have contributed to chaos throughout the region. The German chancellor Angela Merkel, who pushed for the meeting to be convened, said: “Europe must show it is a continent of values, a continent of solidarity ... This is a building block, but we need to take many further steps.” But before the meeting had started on Sunday, the plan under discussion had already drawn criticism for proposing that Balkan and eastern European countries should stop allowing asylum seekers to pass through to other neighbouring countries without first securing agreement from those neighbours. The Croatian prime minister, Zoran Milanović, said before the summit that such consultation was “impossible”. The Slovenian prime minister, Miro Cerar, had warned that the EU would “start falling apart” if it failed to take concrete action to tackle the refugee crisis within the next few weeks. Slovenia, a country of 2 million people, has seen more than 60,000 new arrivals in recent days. The focus of the crisis turned to Slovenia when Hungary clamped down on its border with Serbia, prompting the refugees to switch to Croatia, which in turn imposed border controls. The plan submitted by Juncker seeks to slow the passage of migrants through the safe corridor that has formed through central and eastern Europe towards Austria and Germany by increasing border surveillance, properly registering transient people, and stopping bus and train transfers to the next border without the consent of the neighbouring country. “The immediate imperative is to provide shelter,” said Juncker after chairing the summit. “It cannot be that in the Europe of 2015 people are left to fend for themselves, sleeping in fields.” Nearly 250,000 refugees have passed through the Balkans since mid-September, many fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The plan’s main points To increase reception capacity to 30,000 places by the end of the year in Greece. The UN refugee agency will provide rent subsidies and host family programmes for at least 20,000 more people. To seek additional capacity of 50,000, reaching a total of 100,000 along the western Balkans route and Greece. To deploy 400 police officers within a week to Slovenia. To step up efforts to facilitate return of migrants not in need for international protection and step up cooperation on repatriation with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iraq and Pakistan. To scale up the Poseidon Sea joint operation in Greece, in particular the EU’s border agency Frontex’s presence in the Aegean Sea, and strengthen significantly Frontex support to Greece in registering and fingerprinting activities. To refrain from facilitating the movement of migrants to the border of another country. To set up contact points to allow daily exchanges of information regarding migrant movements. To exchange information on the size of movement and flows of refugees. Frontex as well as the EU’s asylum office ESAO will put this exchange of information in place. To contact financial institutions including the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to secure finances for accommodation of refugees. To step up police and judicial cooperation actions against migrant smuggling, engaging Europol and Interpol in Western Balkan route operations. To reinforce support of the bloc’s border agency Frontex at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. To set up a new Frontex operation at the external land borders between Greece and Macedonia and Greece and Albania to focus on exit checks and registration of refugees who were not registered in Greece. Working together with Frontex to detect irregular border crossing and support registration and fingerprinting in Croatia."
2015-12-16T19:24:18Z,Effective action on borders is key to Britain’s referendum vote | Editorial,"This week’s European Union summit in Brussels was once seen as being the crunch moment for David Cameron’s timetable to reform Britain’s relations with the EU in advance of the planned referendum. Recently, however, a combination of much more pressing Europe-wide issues, notably migration and terrorism, plus some stuttering progress in Mr Cameron’s discussions with fellow EU leaders, have pushed the timetable back. As Sir John Major put it on Wednesday, this summit is not high noon. Instead it could be yet another occasion for burning the midnight oil. That’s because this summit is set to be dominated by another effort to rescue the credibility of the EU’s external and internal borders in the face of Europe’s refugee crisis. Britain’s grievances must therefore wait their place in the queue. February 2016 is now the date when Mr Cameron intends to obtain the “binding and irreversible deal” that he seeks in order to win the public’s backing for the UK to remain in the EU. That date would still allow the referendum to be held in June. After all, Greece organised its bailout referendum this summer at a week’s notice. There is, though, an umbilical connection between the summit’s preoccupation with migration and borders and the continuing British focus on the UK’s relationship with the EU. When Mr Cameron originally proposed a referendum, back in January 2013, migration and EU borders were much further down the agenda than they are today, or than they are likely to be when the vote eventually takes place. The Bloomberg speech was principally about the eurozone crisis and the place of national sovereignty within a union of 28 states. Words like migrant and refugee did not appear in it at all. The word “border” appeared only once, almost as an aside. A mere three years later, however, the context is utterly changed. The UK’s concerns about a multi-speed Europe, and whether the rights of non-eurozone member states are adequately protected within the union’s workings, remains an important issue for the committed on both sides but they are not, perhaps shortsightedly, a big popular anxiety. Arguments about national sovereignty remain intense, in Britain as elsewhere, but now because of the backdrop of the refugee crisis rather than of EU-wide fiscal disciplines, as in the aftermath of the eurozone crisis. The referendum campaign, when it finally gets into gear, will inevitably reflect this new context. The shift against EU membership in recent polls may already do so. At a meeting organised by the Centre for European Reform this week, Conservative speakers from all wings of the party argued that, irrespective of what the pro- or anti-Europeans may want, the vote will in fact be shaped by the migration issue. It is hard to disagree with that. To say this is not to say that the older fiscal and sovereignty issues of the Maastricht era or the four heads of Mr Cameron’s negotiating strategy are irrelevant now. In the end, the referendum will still turn on whether the pro-Europeans can marshal a confident case about the benefits of Britain’s future in Europe while also puncturing the many myths about a go-it-alone exit. But the case for Europe must also contain an effective and balanced argument about borders, migration and refugees too, as Angela Merkel has this week acknowledged in the German context. That is why this EU summit is so important. Europe failed the test on refugees this year. Next year – referendum year, perhaps – the test will come again. This week’s summit, which will be asked to back European commission plans to get a humane collective grip on the EU’s borders, is central to the credibility of the union that UK voters will soon be asked to vote on. Britain has a massive interest in making sure the border control system works better. This is therefore a key summit. Mr Cameron should go to it not aiming to stop Europe being effective, as UK prime ministers often do, but aiming to make sure that EU action really works this time."
2015-08-15T23:03:14Z,The readers’ editor on… the semantics of migration | Stephen Pritchard,"Distressing scenes of Syrian refugees bottled up in a football stadium on the Greek island of Kos and pictures of migrants in France existing in miserable conditions near the Channel Tunnel have become all too familiar this summer. The news seems unrelentingly grim, with this newspaper reminding us that while the British press seems obsessed with the wretched souls gathered in Calais, other European nations have been in the grip of an emergency every bit as acute. Earlier this year, after we published a vivid account of the plight of refugees fleeing across the Mediterranean, we were cautioned by a representative of Rosa, a charity giving support to women and girls in the UK, that the term “migrant” should be used with care. It had become loaded with negative connotations, helping serve an agenda that sought to discourage sympathy for those making the desperate – and often deadly – crossing to a new life. Where we knew that people were fleeing war and persecution (something that is never easy to establish) we should call them refugees. Robert McNeil of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford also believes the term “migrant” has become a negative label, morphing from merely referring to a person who moves between countries (the UN definition) to a pejorative term, particularly in the vocabulary of tabloid journalists. There was a need, he said, for the word to be reclaimed as a neutral term for those on the move, pointing out that an migrant can just as easily be a Saudi billionaire moving to Mayfair as a poor north African seeking a basic standard of living in Marseille. Research by Professor Bridget Anderson illustrates just how hard it is to define the word: “When counting migrants and analysing the consequences of migration, who counts as a migrant is of crucial importance. Yet there is no consensus on a single definition of a ‘migrant’. Migrants might be defined by foreign birth, by foreign citizenship or by their movement into a new country to stay temporarily or to settle for the long term. “Some analyses even include children who are UK born or UK nationals, but whose parents are foreign born or foreign nationals, in the migrant population. None of these definitions are equivalent and none fit precisely with ‘migrant’ defined as an individual who is subject to immigration controls.” Perhaps because the term is so difficult to define, the UK is pretty confused about who these people are. In 2011, the Migration Observatory commissioned a poll that sought to establish who the public had in mind when thinking about immigrants. It found that respondents were most likely to think of asylum seekers (62%) and least likely to think of students (29%). Statistics at the time showed that students made up the largest group of immigrants coming to the UK (37%) while asylum seekers were the smallest group (4%). Terminology employed by politicians and the media is crucial to public understanding of any issue, yet the semantics around the movement of people seem particularly highly charged. In Australia, the language used by governments and media to discuss those who arrive “irregularly” by sea has changed dramatically. Reuters Institute fellow Ben Doherty, a Guardian journalist, has found that asylum seekers, once called refugees and boat people, are now officially referred to in government statements as “illegals”. Ministers have publicly alleged they “could be murderers [or] terrorists” and report “whole villages” are coming to Australia in uncontrollable “floods”. Australia’s policies are now framed as a matter of “border protection” from “threats to national security”. This year, we have heard politicians claim that the vast majority of migrants to Europe are travelling for economic reasons; that they are “marauders”, arriving in “swarms”. Journalists tempted to repeat these claims need to remember the figures: the 200,000 migrants who have arrived in Europe this year represent 0.027% of Europe’s 740m population, and 70% of them are genuine refugees, having fled war zones. Only about 1% have reached Calais. • Many thanks to those who took part in our snap poll to decide style for yes and no campaigns in referendums (readers had complained that the current lower case style was confusing). An overwhelming 89% voted to use initial capitals, so it’s yes to Yes… and yes to No. Please note that the readers’ editor email address has changed to observer.readers@observer.co.uk"
2015-09-01T12:53:04Z,Hungarian TV ‘told not to broadcast images of refugee children’,"Employees of Hungarian state television have been instructed not to include children in footage of news pieces about migrants and refugees, a leaked screenshot of editorial advice to journalists at news channel M1 reveals. Hungary’s government-appointed Media Authority, MTVA, denied state media outlets have been told to limit public sympathy towards refugees, arguing that the memo was designed to protect children, while a pro-government journalist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian this had only been one-off instruction. “They do show children sometimes: actually the percentage of children registered in Hungary this year is quite low, so in some opposition media they are somewhat overrepresented,” the source said. Hungary has become a major transit country for migrants and refugees in recent months, but while M1 was quick to broadcast footage showing demonstrations outside the overcrowded transit zone at Budapest’s Keleti station over the weekend, protests against government policies on refugees have received scant coverage in state media. Refugee solidarity group MigSzol has held mass protests against the Hungarian government’s “national consultation” on immigration and the construction of a fence along the country’s border with Serbia. However, the pro-government journalist argued that these protests have been overlooked because “MigSzol tends to campaign against some Hungarian and even EU laws regarding migration.” The civic aid initiatives that have sprung up in lieu of co-ordinated state help have also been largely ignored by state media. The journalist said: “The NGOs helping the migrants are very political: people known from the opposition scene take part and they mix pro-migration content with criticism of the government, so pro-government, more rightwing media won’t really give (a platform) for these people … even if their work to help migrants is okay.” Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party, led by the populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has faced accusations of encroaching on independent journalism since it passed a controversial media law soon after securing its first ever parliamentary majority in 2010. The law raised “serious doubts about the compatibility of the Hungarian legislation with Union law”, the EU media commissioner said at the time. This prompted a change of tack: Fidesz began to acquire outlets through business associates. Last year, it also introduced a progressive media advertising profit tax that seemingly targeted the country’s one remaining major independent television broadcaster, RTL. However, the plan backfired when RTL rescheduled its previously uncritical news programme to a primetime slot and recruited investigative journalists who had left independent media in protest at government interference. The European commission in March forbade Hungary from levying the tax, pending the outcome of an investigation. The Orbán government has also flexed its financial muscle in Hungary’s print media: in the 18 months up to June 2014 the rightwing newspapers Magyar Hírlap and Magyar Nemzet received state advertisement revenues of HUF 1.5bn – more than 10 times that received by the liberal Népszabadság and Socialist Népszava, despite their higher combined circulation. Last autumn, Orbán also touted the introduction of an internet tax, bringing 100,000 people on to the streets of Budapest to protest, after which the idea was put on ice, then scrapped, in another rare government u-turn. While state-media supported Fidesz communications have angered the international community, which has largely deemed the border fence a failure, at home the anti-migrant rhetoric has chimed with voters and helped the party shore up its falling support. While just 3% of Hungarians considered immigration a key issue in a poll at the end of 2014 – a year in which Hungary received over 40,000 asylum applications – the Republikon Institute this week found that 66% of the population believe that “the refugees pose a danger to Hungary and therefore they shouldn’t be allowed” into the country, and just 19% agreed that “it is the duty of Hungary to accept migrants”. “The media law provides for government control of the public channels and the private channels are heavily influenced by politics,” said Tom Popper, editor of the Budapest Business Journal. “The government’s biggest concerns are about Hungarian-language media,” he added."
2015-09-22T15:41:56Z,Theresa May maintains tough stance on 'economic migrants',"The UK home secretary has called for Europe to “get on with the job” of breaking the link between “economic migrants” making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean and settling in Europe. Arriving at the extraordinary European Union interior ministers refugee crisis meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, Theresa May confirmed that Britain would not be taking part in a further EU programme to relocate 120,000 refugees from Italy, Greece and Hungary. Interior ministers were hoping to find a way of settling the highly controversial distribution of the 120,000 across Europe during Tuesday’s meeting. Instead, the home secretary said Britain would only take people direct from Syrian refugee camps in the Middle East and emphasised the need for wider European measures to “return those people who are illegally economic migrants and who have no right to be here”. She made clear that she saw Britain’s role, at the crunch meeting being held on the eve of a refugee crisis summit of European prime ministers, as being to push for rigorous processing of those who have made it to Europe. “We must ensure that people arriving at Europe’s borders are being properly dealt with, properly fingerprinted so that decisions can be made and when they are illegal economic migrants, they can be returned,” May said. Britain, which under the Lisbon Treaty can opt out of the EU refugee relocation programme, is the only member state that will not participate in some form or other. Both Ireland and Denmark, which also have opt-outs, have said they will nevertheless take some of the refugees from within Europe. The home secretary said: “The UK will not be participating in the relocation scheme. We have announced that we will be taking more refugees direct from the Syrian refugee camps – we will be resettling those people in the UK over the next few years. “That means we can help the most vulnerable people. It also means that fewer people will be trying to make that dangerous journey through into Europe which has sadly seen so many lives lost. We also need Europe to get on with the job of wider measures that need to be taken of ensuring that we are breaking the link for economic migrants between making this dangerous journey and settling in Europe.” May’s remarks came as the International Organisation of Migration said that 473,887 men, women and children had arrived in Europe by sea so far in 2015. It added that at least 182,000, or just under 40% of them, were Syrians. The British Refugee Council said the home secretary’s comments were “extremely disappointing”, adding that: “Britain can’t leave refugees to camp on Greek beaches. We must help protect refugees.” The council said May’s emphasis on breaking the link between making it to Europe and settling in the continent “ignores the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ assessment that 84% of arrivals are from world’s top 10 refugee-producing countries”."

2015-12-01T13:18:41Z,#GivingTuesday: an appeal to help alleviate the global refugee crisis,"The Guardian has reported relentlessly about the plight of refugees – from Syria itself, and the countries to which so many have fled; to the European countries that have welcomed refugees with varying degrees of warmth; and from here in the US, where debates have raged about how America should respond to this and so many other immigration crises. These devastating stories of migration and the toll on human lives around the world have amounted to one of the defining issues of 2015. At the end of this year, we feel it is important to stand with those people who so desperately need help. Guardian US is supporting #GivingTuesday and today we are donating our advertising space to six charities working to help people fleeing conflicts in their home countries. All of our display advertising this Tuesday will encourage our readers to donate to help alleviate the global refugee crisis. There are currently around 60 million people seeking sanctuary from oppression and conflict across the globe, many of whom have fled the ongoing war in Syria. The plight of refugees can often seem far removed from our daily lives, and geographic, cultural and language differences mean all too often we overlook those in need. But, as Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner wrote about the Guardian’s global charity appeal for refugees: “It is vital we do not close our hearts, or lose sight of the essential human response, or ignore the needs of some of the world’s most desperate people.” Alongside our Guardian colleagues in the UK and Australia we have chosen to support refugees through this holiday appeal not just to raise money for a vital humanitarian cause but as an act of solidarity. We are standing for empathy and generosity across the globe. In the US we have chosen six charities to receive advertising space on our site. Our aim is to highlight the important work they are doing and to encourage our readers to donate to those in need. Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, works around the world to provide refugees and internally displaced people with everything they need, from psychological care to lifesaving nutrition; setting up hospitals in refugee camps; helping women give birth safely; vaccinating children; and providing access to safe drinking water. The International Rescue Committee responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, helping to restore health, safety, education, economic well-being and power to people devastated by conflict and disaster. IRC teams provide healthcare, infrastructure, learning and economic support to people in more than 40 countries, with special programs designed for women and children. The IRC resettle thousands of refugees in 26 cities across the US each year. Since 2014 alone, Migrant Offshore Aid Station has pulled 12,000 refugees to safety from rickety boats in the Mediterranean Sea. But thousands have drowned on migrant routes. Our campaign will help this inspirational charity expand its search and rescue work in seas off Greece and Turkey, and in south-east Asia. Half of the world’s refugees are children, growing up far from home without consistent education, safety or emotional support. Mercy Corps works to provide those basic needs, providing food, water, language skills and emergency relief. In Lebanon and Jordan, Oxfam America is helping families get the essential supplies they need, while protecting public health with clean water and safe sanitation. In war-torn Syria, the charity is supporting repairs to damaged water networks and helping keep clean water flowing to hundreds of thousands of people. Refugees International has fought to ensure that humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and lifesaving medical care, is available to those displaced both inside and outside Syria. The charity has also spent months in neighboring countries hosting millions of Syrians, and documented the types of assistance needed so as to forcefully argue for more support from the international community. We hope our efforts on #GivingTuesday will encourage people to donate generously to those who are working tirelessly to alleviate suffering."
2015-11-23T15:00:01Z,Refugee Boy by Benjamin Zephaniah - review,"Refugee Boy is about a boy whose parents are from Ethiopia and Eritrea. It’s set at a time of civil war between the two countries; his mum is from Eritrea and his dad is from Ethiopia. The story is really about their son Alem. He went from living with the two people he loved most in Africa to being all alone in the world in the UK. His father brought him to England to get him away from the war, to safety, and after three days he left him and returned to Africa. Alem was left in a care home and it was an awful experience. He got bullied, he was an outsider. It’s about a family who were connected becoming disconnected. The book really affected me. It has changed how I relate to people. It’s made me feel that I don’t want to be rude to anyone; I feel more sympathetic. What if they have a story a bit like Alem’s? It’s made me stop judging people by the way they look; I now want to get know people and hear their stories. I see life from a different perspective. Through the book you see what war can do to people and how people can develop; how you don’t know who people are until you dig deep. I had a story of my own that I didn’t want to tell people that made me different and reading the book made me speak out to my friends. Reading the book I felt so emotional. Something awful happens to Alem (I won’t tell you what because I don’t want to spoil the book) and I felt such empathy for him. He was emotional, depressed, isolated and incredibly alone and trapped. You should read this book if you have ever judged someone by their appearance, or the way they act. Reading this book, you are going to understand people better and see others for who they really are. And actually it improves your friendships; you look at the world in a different way. There’s a political side to it too. People who think refugees are job stealing and worthless people should read this book and understand they have been through so much and deserve refuge and a fresh start in life. If you were in their shoes, you would want that wouldn’t you? When refugees come to the UK they want to make something of themselves; Alem wants to become an architect. I think Benjamin Zephaniah is a great writer. He has obviously listened to people in Alem’s shoes and he’s a deep thinker and he’s done the research and you can feel that he is so inspired. I give this book 10 out 10. It’s one of the most powerful books I’ve ever read. It’s stayed in my heart and mind. I recommended it to my mum and she read it as she was born in Eritrea, and she loved it. I’ve been to Ethiopia and this book has made me realise you can do anything you set your heart on. I recommend it for over 11’s because it’s a bit upsetting. Read it please. It will help you enjoy life, be compassionate and open up to people more.

2016-08-04T11:30:19Z,Costa Rica expects asylum claims to quadruple as refugees head south,"Asylum claims in Costa Rica are set to quadruple this year from 2014 as stricter controls in Mexico and the US force Central Americans fleeing violence and political instability to find new migration routes. Tens of thousands of Central Americans from the “Northern Triangle” countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have fled their homes in recent years to escape violent criminal gangs who regularly target civilians for murder, rape and extortion. While most of this migrant flow still heads north, some refugees have found homes elsewhere on the Central American isthmus. While Belize and Panama have also seen spikes in migration, Costa Rica, one of the most politically and economically stable countries in the region, has become an attractive alternative for Central American refugees. Now, the country is going one step further, following the announcement of a new scheme to offer temporary protection to refugees from the Northern Triangle. Under the new protection transfer agreement (PTA), Costa Rica will accept up to 200 prescreened refugees for periods of up to six months, while their US asylum applications are processed. Migrants who arrive in Costa Rica before applying will not be considered for US asylum. Though only a small number of migrants will benefit from the project, it marks a significant change in the international response to fleeing Central Americans, who were previously considered primarily as economic migrants, unqualified for refugee status. “It is a shift in the way both the US and the region are looking at the outflows from the Northern Triangle,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with Washington-based thinktank Migration Policy. “This is a recognition that people in the Northern Triangle are facing true refugee circumstances and can’t stay in their countries.” The PTA will be the first time in recent Latin American history that a third country will offer temporary protection to refugees. The United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration will assume all costs associated with the project, and if it is successful, organizers hope to broker similar agreements with other countries throughout the region. The announcement is also significant for Costa Rica, which along with managing the spike in asylum applications from the Northern Triangle has found itself at the center of two separate migrant crises, following a border crackdown by its northern neighbor, Nicaragua. After the closure stranded nearly 8,000 US-bound Cubans in the country late last year, the government housed them in shelters while it brokered an airlift with its regional allies. With Nicaragua now blocking the entry of more than 2,000 extra-continental migrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, Costa Rica has again promised the migrants safe passage and offered applications for asylum and spots in several shelters throughout the country. “We consider Costa Rica a champion in managing immigration and an example for the region,” said Carlos Maldonado, the UNHCR chief in Costa Rica. “Human rights has always been one of Costa Rica’s key trademarks and the country’s government, people and civil society have acted admirably when faced with these migrant flows,” he added. Though on its own the PTA will not be bringing Central American refugees to Costa Rica permanently, some experts believe that the agreement and the country’s other refugee-friendly policies could encourage more migrants to try moving south. “It is hard to imagine that the country accepting two hundred people for transfer would change the flow significantly,” Hipsman said, “but the fact that Costa Rica is publicly accepting refugees for processing could signal to would-be refugees or migrants that it might be a more welcoming place.”"
2016-11-16T17:50:38Z,"In one week, 240 feared drowned in Med","About 240 people are suspected to have drowned this week in four separate incidents in the Mediterranean, raising the total annual death toll to an unprecedented 4,500. Deaths in the Mediterranean are now nearly 20% higher than last year’s total of 3,771, which was the previous annual record. About 130 asylum seekers are missing after a rubber boat capsized on Sunday night, while another 100 are thought to have drowned on Tuesday night in a separate incident, the UN refugee agency said. Up to 10 people died in two further tragedies in recent days, bringing the death toll this week to at least 240. In the accident on Sunday 15 survivors were left in the water for 10 hours, clinging on to a piece of a capsized boat, before being rescued by an oil tanker. Nine are still in hospital, Iosto Ibba, a spokesman for UNHCR, said in a phone call. Migration between Turkey and Greece has lessened significantly since March, after Turkey agreed to re-admit people deported from Greece. But crossings between Libya and Italy continue unabated. More than 165,000 people have reached Italy so far this year from north Africa, and the final annual total is likely to surpass the previous record of 170,000. Ibba said the continuing migration flows, and rising death tolls, showed why Europe needed to provide asylum seekers with more legal routes to safety. “Without alternative ways to reach Europe, refugees will always try to reach safety in dangerous ways,” said Ibba. “That’s why it’s so important to expand legal pathways for refugees, including humanitarian admissions, family reunification programmes, private sponsorship, and student visas for refugees. At the same time it’s also important to support the countries of origin and transit, and to keep up search-and-rescue missions, without which the death toll would be even higher.” European countries are attempting to stem migration flows by providing more aid to African countries that agree to re-admit deported asylum seekers. Additionally, navies from countries such as Britain are intercepting and destroying Libyan smugglers’ repurposed fishing trawlers after they enter international waters. But that strategy has failed because smugglers have instead packed their customers into disposable rubber boats – which can be operated by the refugees themselves, allowing the smugglers to remain in Libya. The rising death toll in 2016 can be partly explained by the increasing use of the inflatable boats, which are even more dangerous than the wooden ships they replaced. Syrians are no longer using Libya as a springboard to reach Europe. Instead, Libya is mainly used by people fleeing war and poverty in Nigeria and Sudan, or repression in Eritrea and Gambia. Others are migrant workers who tried to find jobs in Libya, but fled after the civil war there led to the collapse of law and order. Many migrants are kept in slavery-like conditions by their Libyan employers, while others are tortured or extorted, sometimes by the authorities. About 70% say they faced some kind of exploitation in Libya, according to research by the International Organisation for Migration."
2016-09-17T20:07:01Z,"Migrant death toll expected to exceed 10,000 in 2016","The world is on course to register its highest number of migrant deaths this year, as criticism mounts over failing international efforts to cope with the global refugee crisis. Forecasts from analysts at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) indicate that the number of fatalities among refugees will pass the landmark figure of 10,000 in 2016. The dire statistic will cast a shadow over two high-profile summits on migration in New York this week: on Monday the UN general assembly will meet to discuss the record volume of individuals forced to flee their homes as a result of crises and war around the world. That number currently stands at 65 million people, including 21.3 million refugees who have been forced to flee their country. On Tuesday, US president Barack Obama will host a leaders’ summit – to be attended by the prime minister, Theresa May – intended to raise funds for refugee initiatives and expanded resettlement programmes. Julia Black, of the charity Missing Migrants Project at its data analysis centre in Berlin, said that the organisation was confident that the world was facing its highest-ever mortality migration rate. She told the Observer: “Last year we had more than 5,000 deaths across the world. This year we’re already at more than 4,000, but outside of the Mediterranean and Europe the information is so poor we really think it’s a gross underestimate. “This year we’ll reach that 5,000 total again realistically, but I would expect the real figure would be twice as much. The order of magnitude is greater than anything we’ve seen.” A huge proportion of migrant deaths occur from drownings during the hazardous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy. The latest figures show that 3,212 have died so far during 2016 making the journey. The IOM also said it had logged 400 deaths due to migration this year in Latin America. “But the number could easily be two or three times that figure,” said Black. On Saturday thousands of people marched through central London calling on the UK government to display stronger leadership in finding a humane international response to the refugee crisis and urging May to adopt a leading role at the New York meetings. On Saturday night Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, joined calls for May to provide more safe routes of passage to Britain in addition to increasing help for unaccompanied child refugees and accelerating plans to resettle 20,000 Syrians. “The decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging. Britain has always done its bit to help those fleeing persecution – we have to live up to those values again now,” said Cooper. The draft document for the UN summit has been heavily criticised by human rights groups who say it has effectively “sabotaged” its outcome by removing any proposals of substance. Critics also point to the UK government’s donor conference for Syria, held in London in February, which seven months on has yielded only one sixth of the £6bn pledged. On Friday, it emerged that fewer than 5,000 asylum seekers have been relocated from Greece and Italy to other European countries. Adopted one year ago, the EU relocation scheme was designed to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from frontline EU countries. New reports indicate that some Syrian refugees are opting to return home. Ghias Aljundi, a Syrian refugee and adviser to Amnesty International’s campaign on refugees, said that families stranded in Greek refugee camps were so fed up having to wait months in “dire” conditions they were choosing to return to Syria, where more than 470,000 have died in the civil war. “They want to go home to Syria. And we all know how bad the situation is there. One father said: ‘We have lost hope in Europe, we have lost trust in Europe,’” added Aljundi. The dangers faced by refugees will be highlighted in a series of reports unveiled this week. Among them one by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) which is expected to reveal that three-quarters of those who crossed via Libya experienced physical violence, and over a quarter detailed experiences relating to the death of fellow travellers."
2016-10-20T19:00:09Z,UK policy to deport refugees for 'extremist behaviour' criticised,"UK immigration laws permitting refugees to be deported if they exhibit “extremist behaviour” may breach a United Nations convention, the organisation’s general assembly is to be told. In a speech condemning states for exploiting security fears to frustrate their international legal obligation to provide safe havens, the UN official responsible for reporting on counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson QC, will criticise the UK’s record. Emmerson, who recently left his post as counsel to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, has been the UN’s special rapporteur on “protecting human rights while countering terrorism” since 2011. “The link between displacement of people from their homes and risks to national security in the countries in which they seek refuge has been irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many states, with the refugee crisis being used to stoke public fears of terrorism,” he is due to tell the UN session on Friday. “There is almost no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others. These claims are analytically and statistically unfounded.” Following the Islamic State-inspired attacks on Paris last autumn there were widespread reports that some of the gunmen had infiltrated refugee groups travelling through Greek islands. Those reports have since been thrown into doubt amid uncertainty over the black market trade in fake passports. Referring to legislative measures designed to single out suspected radicals from the refugee population, Emmerson says: “The United Kingdom, as just one example here, has enacted legislation allowing for the review and revocation of refugee status if a person is thought to have exhibited extremist behaviour, or if their dependents have acted in a manner inconsistent with British values. “Legislation of this kind, with the vagaries that are necessarily entailed in such generalised definitions, runs a risk of falling short of the requirements of the 1951 refugee convention.” His reference is to a Home Office report, Asylum Policy Instruction: Revocation of Refugee Status, published earlier this year. It states: “Extremist behaviour: where there is any evidence that a refugee or their dependents have engaged in unacceptable behaviours (whether in the UK or abroad) considered not conducive to the public good or has acted in a way which undermines British values, their status must be reviewed [and referred to the special cases unit ].” It also notes that: “Although there is no requirement to formally respond to representations from [the UN high commissioner for refugees] caseworkers must take their comments into account as part of the decision on whether to proceed with revocation and provide UNHCR with a copy of the final decision.” Elsewhere in his speech, Emmerson says: “Almost without exception, refugees and migrants do not pose a risk – they are in fact at risk, fleeing regions where terrorist groups are most active. It is beyond question that terrorist activity, in the form of asymmetrical armed conflict, is a significant driver for internal displacement and the flight of refugees. “Many states have introduced stricter border controls, built fences and walls to keep migrants and refugees out, engaged in push-back operations, criminalised irregular migration and abandoned pledges to accept refugees. “Among the measures that pose serious human rights concerns are ethnic or religious profiling, the disproportionate collection of often inaccurate biometric and other data, forced fingerprinting and, perhaps most seriously, the criminalisation of irregular migration.” Emmerson also raises concerns about the EU/Turkey agreement, which “provides for the blanket return of all migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece”. He said he was concerned about the “absence of individualised consideration and the risk of detention or ill treatment in Turkey”. Emmerson’s report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees, which details his criticisms, is on the UN’s website."
2016-12-29T18:26:45Z,Britain’s responsibility for refugee children | Letters,"As Lord Dubs has himself reflected (A hostile Europe may turn its back on child refugees, says Labour peer, 29 December), he was just one of a handful of children who were able to gain access to the UK in the late 1930s. In common with, for example, the Oxford geochronologist Professor Stephen Moorbath and actor Andrew Sachs, both of whom have died in recent months, Alf Dubs has contributed hugely to the life and welfare of the UK and all those who made their way here in flight from murder by the Third Reich went on to establish personal, family and professional lives and, as a scientific colleague said at Stephen Moorbath’s funeral, have repaid their refuge in the UK many times over. Can it really be the case that 85,000 unaccompanied, traumatised and distressed children are going to be kicked from pillar to post, spurned, left to drift, vulnerable to sexual exploitation, childhoods for ever lost? The UK government has made a pathetic token gesture and allowed in a tiny number. Now the gates are bolted shut and gatekeeper May is devoid of compassion. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • Joan Smith (We are failing to help a generation of traumatised children, 28 December) will be heartened to know that the welfare of traumatised refugee children is being addressed by a new charity in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The Kalimat Foundation, which takes its name from the Arabic for “words”, takes books into refugee camps and supports trained staff who use stories to help children understand what has happened to them. The charity, which was established earlier this year by Sheikha Bodour Al Qasimi, whose father is the ruler of Sharjah, believes stories can unlock feelings and aid the journey to recovery.

2016-11-03T00:01:33Z,"EU policy leading to abuse of migrants in Italy, claims Amnesty","European migration policies have led to the alleged torture, abuse and illegal deportation of asylum seekers arriving by boat to Italy, according to dozens of migrant testimonies published for the first time. Forty Sudanese migrants were also illegally deported to Sudan without recourse to proper asylum procedures, and at least one of them – a refugee from Darfur – was beaten by officials on his return, interviewees said. The alleged abuse is the natural outcome of the EU’s new migration strategy, according to Amnesty International, which conducted the research. The implementation of the EU ‘hotspot’ system, which forces all migrants to be fingerprinted on arrival in Italy, and the failure of the EU’s relocation scheme, which has meant more refugees are housed in Italy and Greece than most EU members, has stretched Italian resources and created a dynamic that encourages abuse, Amnesty said. One Sudanese victim told the Guardian: “I saw someone tortured with electricity – I saw it with my own eyes.” The 23-year-old, who also provided testimony to Amnesty, added: “He refused to give [the police his] fingerprints, and that’s why they did it. They used Tasers.” The Italian interior ministry did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Italian officials and politicians have previously warned that the country lacks the resources to care properly for so many asylum seekers, and needs more support from its European neighbours. Since 2015, European leaders have forced Italy to register all arrivals from Libya, effectively making Italy responsible for their care, without welcoming any themselves. Just 1,200 refugees have been formally relocated from Italy to other European countries out of the 40,000 whom EU members initially promised to absorb. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, threatened last week to veto the disbursement of EU funds to countries that failed to welcome refugees from Italy. “Italy cannot take another year like the one we’ve just had,” Renzi said. Amnesty’s lead researcher on the project, Matteo De Bellis, said: “The hotspot approach, designed in Brussels and executed in Italy, has increased, not decreased, the pressure on frontline states. It is resulting in appalling violations of the rights of desperately vulnerable people for which the Italian authorities bear a direct responsibility and Europe’s leaders a political one.” The vast majority of incoming migrants appear to have been treated in a humane manner by Italian police. The Italian navy and coastguard also play an instrumental role in the rescue of hundreds of thousands of stricken asylum seekers in the southern Mediterranean. But the testimonies released on Thursday reveal that several officials, under pressure to fingerprint uncooperative asylum seekers, and to stem migration numbers, have abused people and returned them to dangerous situations without allowing them to apply for asylum. One 27-year-old victim alleged that policemen in Sicily beat and Tasered him before using a pair of three-pronged pliers on his naked testicles. “I was on a chair made of aluminium, with an opening on the seat,” he told Amnesty, in testimony also confirmed by a second victim. “They held [my] shoulders and legs, took my testicles with the pliers, and pulled twice. I can’t say how painful it was.” A 16-year-old from Darfur told Amnesty that he was electrocuted after he tried to resist being fingerprinted. “They gave me electricity with a stick, many times on the left leg, then on right leg, chest and belly,” he was quoted as saying. “I was too weak, I couldn’t resist and at that point they took both my hands and put them on the machine.” A Darfurian man deported to Sudan in August told the Guardian he was expelled despite telling policemen that he wished to apply for asylum. “I told them I wanted political asylum in Italy,” he said by telephone. “But I’m not sure the translator translated this.” The dangers of his illegal deportation became apparent on his arrival in Sudan. At least one returnee was beaten by Sudanese security officials during his interrogation, the man said. “He was dragged on the floor, and hit with a chair. We were in the same room, and he was next to me. I don’t [know] why they did it.” The Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, has been charged by the international criminal court with three counts of genocide in Darfur. The Guardian has asked the Sudanese government for comment. Additional reporting: Eiad Abdullatif"
2016-03-11T18:19:55Z,Greece rules out using force against migrants and refugees,"The Greek government has announced it will have reception centres with a capacity to host 50,000 people ready next week as figures showed the number of refugees and migrants in the country has passed 42,000. The country’s leftist-led coalition, racing against the clock to deal with the massive influx, ruled out using force to relocate more than 12,000 men, women and children stranded in increasingly wretched conditions on the Greek-Macedonian border. Instead, it said it hoped the people who are trapped in a waterlogged camp where sanitation facilities have deteriorated and illness has become rife would understand that Europe’s Balkan corridor had been closed and choose to settle in organised shelters. “We have to persuade them [to move] and we can’t do that using teargas,” said the deputy public order minister, Nikos Toskas. “Half the people there are women and children.” Authorities handed out fliers urging refugees to leave the sprawling tent city that has sprung up around Idomeni because there “is no hope” they can continue their journey north into Europe following the decision of Macedonia and other Balkan states to seal the route. Earlier this week, more than 14,000 people – including a baby boy born in a mud-clad tent to a Syrian refugee on Sunday – were caught in limbo as a result of the border closures. With debt-stricken Greece being tested to its limits by the crisis, the European Union pledged to expedite the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. Seen as the easiest gateway into the 28-member bloc, Greece has been on the frontline of the emergency since hundreds of thousands of people began seeking refuge on the continent after fleeing conflict and poverty in Syria and elsewhere. “We have a moral duty as Europeans to offer this help to refugees,” the EU’s leading humanitarian aid policy maker, Christos Stylianides, told reporters after holding talks in Athens with prime minister Alexis Tsipras. “I want to be clear: Greece is not alone in these difficult times.” Disaster relief of the sort normally distributed to developing nations has been earmarked for the myriad NGOs working out of the country under a €700m (£540m) EU aid programme announced last week. The package is due to be given the green light on Tuesday before being sent to the European parliament for further endorsement. “The humanitarian crisis that we currently have in Idomeni is not a Greek matter, it is a European matter and we should all face it together,” Tsipras said after the meeting. He said the overstretched state apparatus, which is preparing holding facilities for 10,000 people every week, should receive financial support. Despite the contours of an agreement being reached with Turkey at an emergency EU summit to stem the flows on Monday, increasing numbers of migrants and refugees are continuing to make the often perilous journey to Greece’s Aegean isles. By Friday, 42,253 were inside the country, according to Athens, including 864 who landed on Greek shores on Thursday and about 1,600 who reached the Aegean island of Chios on Wednesday. Announcing that the time had come to focus on the smuggling rings behind the illicit flows, the deputy defence minister Dimitris Vitsa, who is coordinating the Greek government’s response to the crisis, told Star TV: “We have to turn our eyes to traffickers [in Turkey] … because it is they who are selling false hope to people.”"
2016-12-15T12:47:48Z,EU claims of success in curbing Niger migrants greeted with scepticism,"The EU has hailed a plunge in the number of migrants crossing Niger to reach Europe as a success for its anti-trafficking strategy, even as MEPs complained that the bloc’s figures did not add up. The volume of migrants making the perilous journey across Niger’s desert fell from 70,000 in May to 1,500 in November, according to an EU statement released on Wednesday. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the bloc’s funding of anti-migration measures in Africa was creating “positive results and important building blocks for new cooperation”. The Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipila, has called for the scheme to be extended to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. At an EU summit on Thursday, an announcement of thousands more “voluntary assisted returns” to Libya is expected. But doubts about the probity of the figures for Niger cast a shadow over Wednesday’s announcement. The declared drop in migrants crossing Niger is based on an assessment of just two monitoring points, and data that “does not reflect overall entries or exits to and from Niger”. That assessment – by the International Organisation for Migration – also suggests that migrants are avoiding key towns and transit points in Niger “for fear of repression”, casting further doubt on what EU officials had described as “a success story” for EU policy. The Green MEP Judith Sargentini branded the European commission’s claim to have reduced migrant numbers in Niger as being “at least questionable, if not harmful for migrants”. She said: “EU support for Niger’s border guards has made people smuggling even more profitable, as the prices of people smuggling rise due to increased border guards. Meanwhile, proposals for legal pathways for refugees and economic migrants are nowhere to be seen. In all aspects, this is a failing approach.” Many migrants are thought to have travelled north through Niger to Libya, from where human smugglers ferry them to Italy on ramshackle boats. Sargentini, a member of the European parliament’s development committee, pointed out that more people had died in the Mediterranean Sea this year than in 2015, and said that the EU’s pride at trends in Niger was misplaced. “If the EU really did reduce the number of people transiting through that country, where are those people now, and what state are they in?” she asked. Senior EU officials insist it is too early to conclude that traffickers have diverted their routes via neighbouring Mali to avoid detection by EU-trained border guards. But one said that the bloc was “starting to see circumstantial evidence” of this. By early next year, the EU wants to sign agreements linking aid to migration restrictions with five African countries – Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia. EU officials will then be deployed in these countries to help with measures such as the biometric registration of migrants passing through. In a progress report for Senegal, EU sources say “a lot of work has to be done on the root causes of migration”, although they are hopeful of progress in Nigeria, where the readmission of deported EU migrants began in October. In total, 4,430 people have been repatriated from Europe under the migration pacts so far, and a further 2,700 people have been returned to priority countries. However, Raphael Shilhav, Oxfam’s EU migration adviser, said the policy had been short-sighted in its depiction of migration as a negative phenomenon. “Migration is an important tool for development in western Africa and a vital coping mechanism for displaced peoples,” he said. “In the Lake Chad basin, we have millions of people displaced – including across borders – and an EU intervention to close down borders is problematic. These people need humanitarian assistance.” Many NGOs and MEPs complain that existing development aid pledges are being diverted towards projects aimed at stemming migration. There are no reliable figures for how much of the contribution that EU countries make to a €2.5bn Africa Trust fund linked to migration curbs comes from existing development aid budgets. “You can’t say that it is new [money],” said one EU official. “It may be additional funding that is being mobilised for this purpose.”"
2016-09-21T17:01:13Z,Where Theresa May’s stance on refugees takes us | Letters,"Theresa May posturing to the UN on uncontrolled migration (May refuses to take more Syrian refugees, 20 September) was a little bit like a serial adulterer giving a lecture on the merits of fidelity in marriage. I’m surprised she didn’t get bottled off stage. First, Mrs May failed to reach UK targets on immigration during her time as home secretary. So, a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Second, the refugee crisis that she refers to is largely a consequence of UK foreign policy. In 2007, the UN estimated that the Iraq war caused 2 million people to flee the conflict. This year,the UN estimated that 4.8 million had fled Syria. More than that fled Afghanistan during the UK’s period of intervention. Surprisingly, dropping bombs upon people causes them to run away. Perhaps Mrs May should dwell upon that fact, rather than lecturing the UN about the differences between refugees and economic migrants. Paul Dodenhoff Leyland, Lancashire • The “polite and gentle” boy killed attempting to climb on to a lorry last Friday (Report, 20 September) could have been the child I met while volunteering in the Calais migrant camp last month. I was teaching English, as part of Care4Calais’s outreach scheme. He was small for his age and his eyes were red with tiredness and tear gas. He explained that each night he climbed trees in order to jump down on to the lorries. He would cut the tarpaulin in a vain attempt to evade the heat sensors and sniffer dogs. Each night he would be returned to the camp, often after a beating from the police. Walls and fences will not keep desperate people out (including unaccompanied children); surely we have a moral responsibility to at the very least let the children in. There must be no more deaths. Simon Shaw Vice president, Redbridge Teachers’ Association • Patrick Kingsley (Opinion, 20 September) knows more than most what Theresa May’s asylum/refugee policies are all about: keep them out. This guided her through her Home Office days. She could reflect on what is happening in Canada, where Justin Trudeau’s government has settled 30,000 Syrians, mostly families, mostly welcomed and sponsored by Canadian families. In the UK many people have offered to do the same, but Mrs May won’t allow this to happen, even when people have offered full housing and financial support. Doesn’t matter what is happening in Syria or elsewhere – “keep them out and leave it to others” is the voice inside Mrs May’s head, a voice not susceptible to humanitarian considerations. Bruce Ross-Smith Oxford • The real challenge facing world leaders attending President Obama’s summit on refugees (Report, 19 September) is tackling the root causes of migration, not just the effects. By ignoring the state-sponsored violence in countries such as Sudan (the source of the third-largest group arriving in the UK) our leaders seek a sticking plaster rather than a cure. Even more concerning is the UK’s involvement in the so-called Khartoum process, whereby Europe aims to prevent Sudan’s refugees from reaching Libya and the Mediterranean. If we turn a blind eye to Sudan’s record of ethnically cleansing its non-Arab and non-Muslim citizens, refugees will continue to seek sanctuary – and are allowed to do so under international law. Were Sudan’s government to be persuaded to stop bombing and oppressing its own civilians, they would be more likely to stay there. By too often appeasing Sudan’s leaders, we have guaranteed that thousands of Sudanese will continue to seek refuge with their former colonial rulers. Olivia Warham Director, Waging Peace"
2016-11-28T12:27:22Z,2016 sets new record for asylum seekers reaching Italy by boat,"More asylum seekers have now reached Italy by boat in 2016 than in any previous year on record. Nearly 171,000 people have arrived in Italy from north Africa since the start of the year, according to statistics compiled by the UN refugee agency and the Italian government. As of Monday, the total had surpassed the previous record of 170,000, set in 2014. Migration flows in the eastern Mediterranean between Turkey and Greece have been drastically reduced after improvements in Turkish policing, increased threats of deportation from Greece, and the closure of a humanitarian corridor between Greece and Germany. But Europe’s deterrent strategy has failed to cut migration in the central Mediterranean between Libya and Italy, with the Italian route once again becoming the main migrant gateway into Europe. European navies, including Britain’s, have focused on a military-style response, sending frigates to arrest smugglers in international waters. Libyan smugglers have responded by sending passengers on board inflatable dinghies that are piloted by migrants themselves, reducing smugglers’ exposure to arrest and allowing their business to continue as normal. The Libyan civil war has weakened the country’s law enforcement agencies, some of whom are complicit in the smuggling, leaving European governments without viable Libyan partners in their fight against migration. The chaos there also gives migrants more incentive to leave for Europe; in previous years they could more easily find work and stability in Libya. Pressure on transit countries in the Sahara desert, through which many African migrants pass before reaching Libya, has had no effect. Flows through Niger, the country to Libya’s south, increased in 2016, despite Niger introducing new anti-smuggling laws at the request of the EU. Displacement in north-east Nigeria, where 1.4 million people have been forced to flee Boko Haram, may contribute to sustained levels of migration towards Europe in the future. The numbers coming to Europe are nevertheless insignificant compared with flows within Africa itself. Just 3.3% of the world’s displaced Africans have reached Europe. More than 93% remain within their home continent. The majority of migrants bound for Italy are fleeing poverty, wars and dictatorships in Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan and the Gambia. Syrians no longer use the Libyan route. The breakdown of law and order has significantly worsened living conditions for foreign workers in Libya since 2011. Many report conditions tantamount to slave labour, while hundreds have been kidnapped for ransom, and sometimes tortured. A recent survey of new arrivals in Italy by the International Organisation for Migration found that 70% of respondents had been exploited to some degree during their journey to Europe. Other recent IOM research shows that the majority had not intended to travel to Europe when leaving home, but had been forced to change their destinations due to extenuating circumstances such as the Libyan civil war."
2016-12-09T12:21:28Z,Please help us help #childrefugees survive the winter - Guardian/Observer 2016 Appeal,"The plight of child refugees is at the heart of this year’s Guardian and Observer charity appeal. We supported refugees last year and we are proud to return to this theme again. It remains the great humanitarian crisis of our times. The political mood has hardened around immigration, and in a volatile world the tragedy of forced migration can seem less visible. Yet the reality is inescapable: in Europe, thousands of children are stuck in squalid camps or sleeping rough, caught up in political turmoil beyond their control and exposed to multiple dangers. This year, record numbers of children have drowned in the Mediterranean; others have been placed in detention for travelling without documents. Official figures indicate more than 90,000 children have travelled alone, fleeing war and destitution across Europe. Charities believe the real figure is higher, because so many have slipped beneath the radar. The Guardian and Observer have consistently reported the dire conditions faced by many children: the rat-infested camps, the unheated squats and the muddy ditches that they are forced to call home. We’ve published interviews with children of primary school age, travelling without parents, worried about how to feed themselves and how to get to safety. Child refugees running from war and violent unrest in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan have told us Europe can seem an unwelcoming place. Many are shocked to find themselves living in camps that may be safe from bombs, but where conditions are far worse than what they were used to at home. Most despair at being stuck in limbo, unable to continue their education, wasting their lives. They risk disease, trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. Let’s be clear: without help, some will not survive the winter. The UK government’s response has been muted. It has resisted efforts to allow child refugees to be reunited with families in the UK, and delayed attempts to give shelter to the most vulnerable children travelling alone. The major aid agencies are clear that the UK has not accepted its fair share. The issue provokes both weariness and hostility from many in Britain; some find it convenient to conflate asylum seekers with economic migrants, and adopt a less than welcoming approach. Child refugees have been criticised for not looking sufficiently young. Our view has not changed from last year. The political solutions to the refugee crisis may be complex, but that does not mean we should abandon our humanity. We should not close our hearts, retreat behind walls, real or imagined, or ignore the pressing moral imperative to provide assistance and sanctuary for some of the world’s most desperate people. Guardian and Observer readers last year demonstrated extraordinary solidarity with refugees. Through our 2015 appeal you showed in your thousands that a more compassionate voice exists amid the rancour. You signalled a wish for a more tolerant, empathetic, kinder society. Above all, you showed amazing generosity: last year’s appeal raised an astonishing £2.6m for refugee charities. This year we are asking readers to donate to three fantastic charities that offer practical and effective help and support to child refugees, whether they are travelling alone or with families, or have already arrived in the UK. All combine a passionate entrepreneurialism with a dynamic commitment to social justice. Help Refugees brings a refreshing vitality and energy to the provision of emergency humanitarian aid. Set up just 16 months ago by a group of friends wondering what they could do to help refugees, it has grown to become one of Europe’s largest distributors of food, clothes, shelter and medicine to refugees, supporting over 50 projects across the continent. Safe Passage is another new project, created by the Citizens UK charity last year to help provide legal support to hundreds of unaccompanied refugee children, so that they can apply for asylum in the UK – many of them to be reunited with family members resident here – rather than risking their lives smuggling themselves in on lorries. Once refugee children are in the UK, adapting to their new surroundings can be a lonely and demoralising experience. A series of projects run by The Children’s Society provide a range of services from legal advice to help youngsters access education and housing, to language lessons, social activities and mentoring. The aim is to help youngsters overcome the trauma of migration, and to support them to rebuild their lives. Guardian and Observer journalists will over the next few weeks highlight the vital work of our three charities through words, pictures, and film, both online and in our newspapers. We have been inspired by them and their work, and we hope you will be too. Help us once again to show solidarity with refugees. Please give generously. • Support the three chosen charities by donating here"
2016-10-23T05:00:36Z,Why is it vulgar to speak up for migrants?,"In London an exhibition has just opened at the Barbican called The Vulgar. It is a fashion exhibition, with clothes that are often funny, but spotlit on mannequins so nobody laughs. There’s a Hussein Chalayan dress covered in false nails, a Courrèges minidress and 18th-century gowns the width of a studio flat. There are gold things. There are fans, which became vulgar when they were mass-produced. There are neo-classical dresses, vulgar because they are copies. Accompanying the fashions are definitions of the word by psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, which inspire the titles of each room: “Showing Off,” “Puritan,” “Extreme Bodies,” “Too Popular,” and “Common”. I sat with a cup of tea afterwards with one eye on Twitter. Lily Allen had been to the Jungle camp in Calais with the BBC and met a 13-year-old boy from Afghanistan. She broke down as she explained to him: “At three different intervals… the English in particular have put you in danger… We’ve bombed your country, put you in the hands of the Taliban and now put you in danger of risking your life to get into our country. I apologise on behalf of my country. I’m sorry for what we have put you through.” On Twitter she was dismissed as “pampered, coiffured and irrelevant”, urged to “speak for herself, not the nation – she represents nobody”, and received multiple warnings of rape, both for her and her daughters. The Sun said hers were “crocodile tears”, writing: “Before Lily starts ‘apologising’ for Brit troops taking on the Taliban, perhaps she should say sorry for her own mistakes. Two years ago her appalling single ‘URL Badman’ tanked at No 93. Earlier this year the attention-seeking mum passed out after a bender at the Notting Hill Carnival.” Jan Moir dedicated her Daily Mail column to Allen: “Just another indulged idiot who fondly imagines herself to be a daring and provocative political voice… Darling Lily got a fabulous manicure, put on an ever-so-serious, no-make-up face and took a camera crew with her to visit the Jungle. (There ain’t much in the way of practical work a gal can do with those nails, but never mind.) It looked quite good when Lily was filmed ladling out the soup for five minutes,” she said, adding: “The 31-year-old mother of two started crying, which must have been very confusing for the little boy, not to mention scary – but at least she didn’t sing.” As I read the criticism, one of Phillips’s definitions flashed to mind. Vulgar: “Impossible ambition: the arrivistes, the nouveau riche, the immigrants, the upwardly mobile.” People trying to be something they are not. People, like Allen, who should know their place. People trespassing on politics, on grown-up issues. She’s not even a good mother so why should we take her seriously? She doesn’t even have the right NAILS. How dare Lily Allen have an opinion about immigration? That is not what Lily Allen is for. Once the concept of vulgarity is in your head it’s hard to shake it out – you recognise it in debates about Brexit, anti-semitism, homophobia. You start questioning why people like Jan Moir and the furious Tweeters find Allen’s visit to Calais so threatening. Like a pensioner wearing a Topshop catsuit, Allen is parading her inappropriate views and emotions in full view of a crowd. She is getting above her station and needs to be knocked back. It’s not simply about her celebrity – I can’t remember a single furious column when Jude Law visited Calais, or Benedict Cumberbatch spoke of the “utter disgrace of the British government” for not doing enough. But their visits weren’t “vulgar” – there is nothing that disorients us about well-educated men speaking passionately. That’s how the world is meant to sound, regardless of what they’re saying. In the shadow of the exhibition, the whole episode made me feel sorry for those rising up to chastise Allen. If her tears and nails and apology require such scorn, doesn’t it suggest a degree of desperation and fear in the scornful? After spending time with those clothes, those images, the 19th-century etiquette manuals and Elizabethan document “enforcing the status of apparel” on materials that were restricted according to class, I sense an ancient anxiety that the barriers these judgers rely on for structure might be disappearing. The risk being then, that their houses would simply crumble. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"
2016-11-23T10:21:27Z,Seven 'migrants' rescued in boat in Folkestone harbour,"Seven people, thought to be migrants, were rescued in a boat in Folkestone harbour in the early hours of Wednesday morning after at least three began suffering from hypothermia. The small boat they were sailing in was found in the harbour after a distress call was made while it was out at sea. It is believed the boat reached the shore without assistance. Kent police said they were called to the scene just after 5.30am because of concerns about the boat. They said: “The Coastguard coordinated a search for the boat which was located at Folkestone harbour and seven suspected migrants were also found.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said a search-and-rescue operation had been launched after a call was received from a boat reporting that people on board were unwell. A spokesman said: “A boat with seven people on board, including three with suspected hypothermia, was then found.” The recovered boat was a small red and black rib (rigid-hulled inflatable boat) with an outboard motor, according to the BBC reporter Simon Jones. The South East Coast ambulance service was also called. “The matter has been passed to Home Office immigration enforcement,” the statement from Kent police added. The Home Office has yet to comment. Speaking to Kent Online, a spokesman for the Kent coastguard said: “There are seven people, possibly immigrants, all males. One was on shore, the others were in a boat. We are now trying to find out where they originated from.” Charlie Elphicke, the MP for Dover and Deal, said the incident highlighted the need to protect UK borders following the closure of the Calais refugee camp. He said: “This is yet another sign of the extreme lengths people will go to, risking their lives trying to break into Britain. Crossing the English Channel in a small boat as winter sets in is about as dangerous as it gets. “It’s clear that although the camp at Calais has been cleared, we now need to be more vigilant than ever. This incident underlines the need to ensure we scan our seas for people smugglers, protect our borders and to strengthen our intelligence effort with France.”"
2016-09-18T23:01:30Z,Theresa May to warn  UN of dangers of uncontrolled mass migration,"Theresa May is to tell the UN general assembly of the dangers of “uncontrolled mass migration” as it meets in New York to discuss how to help more than 21 million refugees around the world. The prime minister will call for a different global approach to migration aimed at “reducing today’s unmanaged population movement” as world leaders gather for the general assembly and a separate summit hosted by Barack Obama. At the UN, May will argue that it is not in the interests of the migrants to be exposed to exploitation and danger as they cross borders, nor the interests of the countries they are leaving, travelling through or seeking to reach. She will say that mass population movements reduce resources and popular support for refugees. Her arguments appear to echo those made by David Cameron’s government, which targeted most of its aid to refugees in countries bordering war zones, in contrast to Germany’s approach of accepting hundreds of thousands of people who had journeyed across Europe. It does, however, leave the door open for the UK to accept more refugees straight from camps, who have not embarked on journeys across seas and borders. May will propose three measures: helping refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach; a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants; and the right of all countries to control their borders, along with a responsibility to stop uncontrolled migration flows. Speaking before the general assembly, May said: “We cannot simply focus on treating the symptoms of this crisis, we need to address its root causes too.” The gathering comes as May faces criticism in the UK for failing to do enough to help refugees and demands to improve the UK’s pledge to settle 20,000 people from Syria over four years. Last week, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of 200 religious leaders to call for more action, criticising the government’s response as “too slow, too low and too narrow”. David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, said this weekend that May should use the summit to promise that the UK will resettle more refugees. “Frankly, the UK should be saying we’ll take 20,000 or 25,000 a year, so four times the current level, 25 refugees per parliamentary constituency rather than just six, because countries like Canada are already doing that,” he said. “So I think the UK could do more on the refugee resettlement side to match the frankly exemplary performance that the UK has on international humanitarian aid.” Yvette Cooper, the chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, called on May to speed up the government’s pledge to resettle 20,000 Syrians – setting a 2018 target rather than 2020 – and offer more help to those fleeing the war. She urged the prime minister to resettle 500 unaccompanied child refugees from the Calais camp and ensure that none were left by Christmas. “The prime minister must show leadership on the refugee crisis,” Cooper said. “She must go to this summit to galvanise international support for refugees and show that Britain can and will meet our commitments. Right now, the decisions parliament and our country have taken are being mired in red tape and government foot-dragging.” The UN summit on refugees and migrants comes as the outgoing secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and Obama attempt to use their remaining time in office to try to make some headway on issue. The UK government has said it will support the New York declaration on refugees and migrants due to be adopted at the UN, which reaffirms humanitarian principles but has been criticised by campaign groups for lacking teeth. Human Rights Watch called the draft of the final document “a missed opportunity” and Amnesty International accused member states of stripping away any proposals of substance. On Tuesday, Obama will host a separate leaders’ summit which will attempt to raise money and secure concrete pledges from countries to accept higher numbers of refugees for resettlement. May is expected to announce additional humanitarian support for refugees from the government’s ring-fenced aid budget later this week, and further action to provide services and create jobs in host countries."
2016-09-19T11:54:15Z,Theresa May's quasi-Darwinian fight to dilute right to claim asylum,"Theresa May will use her first speech to the United Nations to argue that the world’s wealthiest countries should offer only minimum protection to all but the most vulnerable of the world’s refugees. It will mark the start of her international campaign to dilute the right to claim asylum and to ensure – by enshrining the principle that claims for asylum should be made in the first safe country – that more than 86% of the world’s refugees are looked after by the poorest and middle-income countries. For make no mistake, when May talks of agreeing “a better distinction between refugees and economic migrants” she is talking about limiting the right of asylum seekers to reach Europe to have their claims for refugee status properly considered. When she also proposes that countries must “take responsibility to stop uncontrolled migrant flows” she is willing the means to ensure that happens. We know this because the UN’s speech is not a one-off. Indeed May showcased her strategy for dealing with the worst refugee crisis since the second world war in her Conservative party conference speech as home secretary last October. Then she made clear that she wanted to limit the number of asylum seekers who made it to Britain to claim refugee status by branding those who had made it across the Mediterranean to Calais or Britain as the “wealthiest, fittest and strongest” with the quasi-Darwinian implication that they are in some way undeserving queue-jumpers. She said more than 290,000 Syrians had claimed asylum across Europe at that point, and contrasted them sharply with the plight of the “most vulnerable” refugees in the Middle East camps. May boasted of Britain’s decision to take 20,000 of those most vulnerable refugees and promised she would “not in a thousand years” take part in any Europe-wide refugee responsibility-sharing programme. Instead May asserted last October that she wanted Britain to unilaterally enforce the “first safe country” rule by breaking the link between being recognised as a refugee and getting the right to settle in Britain. “If you’ve spurned the chance to seek protection elsewhere – but we cannot return you to that safe country and you still need refuge – you’ll get the minimum stay of protection and you won’t have an automatic right to settle here,” she warned, adding that when that came to an end they would be returned as soon as a case review deemed it safe for them to do so. This lesser form of refugee status will also apply to those who successfully claim asylum after overstaying a British visa. She also launched her campaign for a review of the international legal definitions of who can qualify as a refugee or be rejected as an economic migrant to chip away at the 1951 Geneva convention definitions of those who should not be returned to countries where they face serious threats to their lives or freedom. This was not just party conference rhetoric. Home Office ministers confirmed in February that work was under way on a strategy to cut the numbers claiming asylum in Britain and to provide temporary protection to all but the “most deserving” refugees. There is a new twist. In her final months as home secretary, May was considering introducing a policy that a greater number of the most vulnerable refugees would be resettled in Britain only if it matched a reduction in those claiming asylum after reaching Britain under their own steam. Today’s UN summit on refugees and migrants will see many developing countries arguing for a major expansion in legal routes such as resettlement programmes, so that the wealthiest countries share some of the responsibility for the greatest refugee crisis since the second world war. They are hoping the UN special assembly will prove a watershed moment in the world’s response. Instead of rising to the challenge, the British prime minister will be blocking people’s escape routes and leaving the world’s poorest countries to cope with the crisis."
2016-12-20T18:00:07Z,The child refugees of Calais: ‘The journey is not yet over’,"Of all the children stuck in the Calais camp, 13-year-old Jawaad (not his real name) was one of the best able to articulate the horror of his situation, living in a tent for months, with no adult to care for him. I met him in August and was impressed by his elegant English, which he had learned from his father, a Nato translator who was targeted by the Taliban for working with western forces, and who had been forced to flee the country separately. Jawaad had no idea where his father was, and had travelled from Afghanistan to France alone. He was finding the conditions in Calais hard to bear. “Every second you are scared that something dangerous will happen to you. The French police are familiar with beating. They don’t care if you are a child or a grownup. They send dogs after us. The dog’s mouth is covered but they can get you with their nails,” he told me, in the tarpaulin shack known as the Kids’ Cafe. When the camp in Calais was demolished, he was one of 1,700 young people put on buses to youth hostels and former old people’s homes and given temporary accommodation while their applications for asylum in the UK were processed. When we spoke by phone in mid-November, he was in a hostel in Talence, Bordeaux. He said he was relieved to be somewhere warm, where he could have a shower, but he hated the feeling of being in limbo. He said the interviewing process by Home Office officials who were assessing his application to join his cousins and uncle in Southampton was “disorganised”. He complained that because none of the boys spoke French and the staff did not speak English, they were communicating through Google Translate on phones. “People feel unhappy and angry,” he said. We know that he travelled to the UK at the end of November, one of 750 unaccompanied refugee children. He is in care while officials consider his application, but beyond that there are very few details of his current existence. He is no longer in touch with Mary Jones, who helped run the Kids’ Cafe. Once the children are taken into care in the UK, they often fall out of contact; usually they are encouraged by their foster parents to cut ties, to avoid any risk that they could be targeted by people smugglers, who may be anxious to have travel debts repaid. Jawaad “is one of the lucky ones”, says Jones, “if you can call a child lucky when he has no idea where his parents are, just that his father is in hiding from the Taliban and his mother had to flee their village when it was overrun by fighters from Daesh”. At least we know now that he is safe, able to study and work towards his ambition of becoming a doctor. Volunteers who worked with the Calais refugee children are more worried about those who remain in France, waiting for a decision on their future. Some have gone on hunger strike. The Home Office announced earlier this month that it has ended the emergency transfer programme to the UK, which means that up to a thousand more Calais children are still waiting. Jones is very worried about reports that several children have left the hostels and are sleeping rough again. “The journey is not yet over for [Jawaad], but hopefully it will just be a matter of weeks before he can get on with his life. For his friends and other refugee children left in France, most of them have given up hope and several have attempted suicide. It is only a matter of time before they go back to Calais and put their faith in smugglers again.” Donate to our refugee appeal at guardian.charitiestrust.org"
2016-07-28T00:00:20Z,"US and Mexico's mass deportations have fueled humanitarian crisis, report says","Mass deportations and inadequate asylum procedures in Mexico and the US have fueled a humanitarian crisis where desperate Central Americans seeking refuge from rampant violence are routinely preyed upon by criminal gangs and corrupt officials, according to a new report by the International Crisis Group (ICG). The tide of people fleeing Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala – three of the five most dangerous countries in the world – continues apace despite beefed-up border control measures implemented after Barack Obama declared the 2014 surge in undocumented migrants a humanitarian crisis. Last year, Mexico deported 165,000 Central Americans, while the US expelled 75,000. In order to avoid detection, vulnerable people – who include increasing numbers of women and unaccompanied children – are forced to pay higher fees to smugglers, crooked officials, and kidnappers, and use riskier, more isolated routes through Mexico, according to the report Easy Prey: Criminal Violence and Central American Migration. Once deported, many simply try again rather than face hunger and violence at home, creating a revolving door of vulnerable migrants and refugees. The report comes after the US, for the first time, recognised that the surge in people currently fleeing Central America includes potential refugees, not just economic migrants. The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a new scheme whereby Costa Rica will offer temporary protection to 200 eligible Central American refugees at a time before they are settled in the US or another country. While the news was welcomed as a positive emblematic step by immigrant rights’ groups, there was widespread scepticism about its potential impact amid rapidly rising asylum claims. As violence in the Northern Triangle spiked in 2015, the number of asylum seekers from these countries rose to more than 110,000 – a fivefold increase from 2012. Most seek refuge in Mexico and the US. Mary Speck, project director for Mexico and Central America at ICG, said: “The [announcement] shows some recognition by the US of this refugee crisis, and it will help some people. But it does nothing to address the major issue of the huge numbers of vulnerable Central Americans already in Mexico and the US.” As many as 400,000 undocumented migrants cross from Central America into southern Mexico each year, according to the International Organization for Migration. The number detained in Mexico has tripled in the past four years amid growing pressure and economic support from the US to stem the flow. The detention of children and adolescents from the Northern Triangle soared from 4,000 in 2011 to 35,000 in 2015. But Mexico is increasingly a destination country, not just a transit route. Asylum applications are rising amid information campaigns led by the UN Refugee Agency: 1,470 people applied for asylum in Mexico in the first three months of 2016 – a larger number than in the whole of 2013. Despite a recent increase in approved asylum claims, drawn-out assessments and inadequate detention facilities mean many who would be eligible either don’t apply or abandon their cases. Mexico has robust laws but its 15 asylum experts are struggling to cope. Mexico has the capacity to absorb many more people, but needs international help, according to the ICG. “The US outsourced its migrant policy to Mexico, and must now work with Mexico to deal with the massive numbers of vulnerable Central Americas here; there is no substitute for this. The mass deportations since 2014 have done nothing to stem the flow of Central Americans. The humanitarian crisis continues, it’s just no longer on the US border,” said Speck. The ICG report also calls on the US to halt the deportation of undocumented Central American youths by offering Temporary Protected Status (TPS) – which would allow them to work legally – rather than risk sending them back to violent neighborhoods. TPS is most commonly offered in cases of armed conflict and natural disasters but “providing it to Northern Triangle nationals facing surging criminal violence would be a reasonable step to protect individuals, especially youths, vulnerable to attacks or [gang] recruitment”, the report states."
2016-09-20T16:48:44Z,Work begins on Calais wall to stop refugees trying to board lorries to UK,"Work has begun on a £1.9m wall to block migrants and asylum seekers from attempting to board lorries heading to the Calais port. The structure will stand 4 metres tall and 1km long on both sides of the dual carriageway approaching the port, a few hundred metres from the main refugee camp, where more than 10,000 people live in conditions that charities describe as dangerous and dirty. It will be made of smooth concrete, making it harder to climb, and extends an existing wire fence that flanks the immediate approach to the port. But charities working with those in the camp have said the project will endanger lives by forcing migrants and refugees to take ever greater risks to reach the UK. Steve Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “This wall will simply push desperate people further into the hands of smugglers and into taking far greater risks to get to the UK, and more will die in the attempt.” The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, announced the plan last week. It will be paid for by the British government as part of a £17m joint Anglo-French package of security measures aimed at preventing people from the “Jungle” refugee camp from stowing away on lorries and other vehicles on the French side of the border. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has said he intends to dismantle the camp entirely by the end of the year. In 2015-16 more than 84,000 migrants and refugees were caught trying to illegally enter the UK at “juxtaposed ports” such as Calais – where immigration checks are carried out before boarding a train or ferry – according to Home Office figures. Photos of foundation works on the wall emerged on Tuesday, but a Home Office spokesman said construction started last week. Charities working with those in the camp say that 13 refugees and migrants, including three children, have died this year attempting to board vehicles approaching the port in a desperate attempt to reach Britain. Last week, a 14-year-old Afghan boy became the latest fatality, dying in a hit-and-run after he fell off a lorry. The boy, who has not been named, was understood to have a legal right to travel to the UK as he had relatives there, but had become frustrated with delays in processing his case. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting on to the road every night. They put tree trunks, branches, gas cylinders” in the road to stop the trucks, the Calais port chief executive, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, said earlier this month, according to AFP. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults,” he said. Research by Help Refugees, one of the charities that works in the camp, found that in September the camp’s population rose above 10,000 for the first time, including more than 1,000 unaccompanied children. An official count by the French authorities last month put the number of people in the camp at 6,900. Matilda Gladstone, a spokeswoman for Help Refugees, said: “We are disheartened that once again money and resources are being poured into building walls to keep people out, and not into helping care for the vulnerable, displaced people in the refugee camp in Calais.” She added: “We would like to see Theresa May prioritise the safety of children over the fear of immigration.” Leigh Daynes, the executive director of Doctors of the World, said: “The use of British taxpayers’ money on fences in France is ludicrous. Walls are not the answer to the humanitarian catastrophe in Calais. “They will not deter vulnerable refugees from seeking to have their asylum claim heard here. It is time for the UK to hear and settle those claims in France and end the suffering of ordinary people in search of a better life.”"
2016-12-01T13:35:01Z,Canada prepares for surge of Mexican immigrants after visa lift and Trump win,"Officials in Canada are readying for a potential surge in Mexican migrants, as a promise to scrap a visa requirement comes into effect amid uncertainty over Donald Trump’s promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants. From Thursday, Mexican visitors to Canada will no longer need visas. The move has left the government anticipating an increase in Mexican tourists and business travellers, a spokesperson for Canada’s immigration ministry said. The visa was put in place in 2009 by the previous Conservative government to address an increase in what it described as bogus refugee claims. But the timing of the visa lift – following on the heels of Trump’s vows to expel millions of illegal immigrants – has sparked concerns among officials that Canada could again see a substantial increase in Mexican asylum seekers, government sources told the Guardian. Between 2005 and 2008, Canadian officials said refugee claims from Mexico nearly tripled, making Mexico the number one source country for claims. Of the more than 9,400 claims filed by Mexicans in 2008, just 11% were accepted. The visa was embraced as a means of border control by the Conservative government. “The visa requirement I am announcing will give us a greater ability to manage the flow of people into Canada,” the then immigration minister Jason Kenney said in a statement. “In addition to creating significant delays and spiralling new costs in our refugee program, the sheer volume of these claims is undermining our ability to help people fleeing real persecution.” After the visa was introduced, the number of Mexican asylum seekers plunged – dropping to 120 in 2015 – but the Canadian government came under tremendous political pressure from Mexico to end the policy. In June, the government agreed to do so, in exchange for Mexico expanding its imports of Canadian beef. “This move will make it easier for our Mexican friends to visit Canada, while growing our local economies and strengthening our communities,” Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said at the time. At the time, few had considered the possibility that Trump – who had vowed to build a wall along the shared border between the US and Mexico and deport millions of undocumented workers and illegal residents – would win the US election. If Trump carries through on those pledges, it could result in a substantial impact on Canada, said Toronto immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman. “It’s the lifting of the visa and the fact that Trump is going to take over, those two factors together are seen as a major pull factor attracting people to come to Canada.” He drew parallels with another wave of migrants that headed north in recent years. “After 9/11, when there was a significant crackdown in the United States on Muslims, there was a significant number of people who came across the border from the United States into Canada at that time.” Others disputed whether the visa lift and Trump presidency would result in a substantial increase in Mexican migrants to Canada. “I imagine there will be some increase, perhaps to numbers similar to before the Great Recession hit,” said César Cuauhtémoc of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. “The reality, however, is that many Mexicans have strong reasons – family ties and longstanding economic relationships are two of the most prominent – to set their sights on the United States despite the difficult path to lawful migration.” Net migration from Mexico to the US has dropped over recent years, thanks to tougher enforcement on the border and a relatively stable jobs market. But Trump’s election victory – and his promises to tear up existing trade agreements and impose stiff import duties – have caused the peso to plunge and sparked fears of an economic crisis in Mexico. Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship has downplayed any concerns, arguing that the visa lift will yield deeper ties between Canada and Mexico and boost tourism. “We are very happy to welcome more Mexican tourists to this country and to accept the jobs that go along with that,” John McCallum recently told the House of Commons. “Of course we knew there were risks. There are risks when you do anything.” The government will continue to closely monitor migration from Mexico, he said, and could move to reinstate the visa if it sees a spike in the number of Mexican asylum seekers. “There would come a point where a visa could be reimposed,” he said. “Canada retains its sovereignty on this issue. There comes a point where it would become unsustainable, but we are hoping that point will not arrive.”"
2016-10-18T06:00:31Z,Survey finds 70% of migrants arriving in Europe by boat trafficked or exploited,"More than 70% of migrants travelling overland through north Africa to Europe have become victims of human trafficking, organ trafficking and exploitation along the way, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The IOM’s surveys of migrants arriving in Europe by boat reveal that nearly three-quarters of those interviewed show strong indicators of having been trafficked or exploited for profit by criminals at some point on their journey. Nearly half of all those questioned (49%) reported being held in a location against their will, often for ransom. The majority of these cases occurred in Libya. Half of migrants said they had worked without pay, with many being threatened with weapons by an employer or labour broker. Others said that forced labour was the only way of being freed from captivity or securing a place on a boat to Europe. The surveys also revealed an emerging trend of organ and blood trafficking: 6% of all respondents reported that they had experience of someone being forced to give blood against their will or while captive, or of organs being used as payment for parts of the journey. According to the surveys, men are more likely to have fallen victim to human trafficking than women, although the IOM did not ask specific questions about forced prostitution or trafficking for sexual exploitation. The surveys also show that the longer someone is in transit, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited or trafficked, with migrants who spent six months or more journeying to Europe three times more likely to have fallen prey to criminal exploitation than those who were in transit countries for less than two weeks. The IOM spent 10 months gathering data from more than 9,000 migrants (pdf – NB, this shows data for just three months) on the central and eastern Mediterranean routes. As well as collecting information on the prevalence of forced labour and organ trafficking, the surveys also asked about marriage, and forced marriage, while in transit. Fewer than 1.5% of respondents said they had received an offer of marriage in exchange for money along the route. On the eastern Mediterranean route – where migrants travel overland via Turkey and Greece – 14% of migrants reported signs of human trafficking and exploitation. About 6% reported being held against their will, 7% said they worked without pay. As many as 4% said they were forced into work against their will, most of these instances occurring in Turkey. Incidents of organ and blood trafficking were reported in Turkey, Greece, Albania, Macedonia and Serbia. The IOM said its surveys are the first attempt to quantify the prevalence, scale and frequency of labour and other forms of human trafficking on the major migrant routes. “What these surveys show is that human trafficking networks are becoming brutal and efficient at exploiting and making profit from the vulnerability of migrants,” says Simona Moscarelli, anti-trafficking expert at the IOM. “There is still very little real recognition of the scale of this business or just how much money is being made from the misery and labour of people fleeing war or poverty.” Kevin Hyland, the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the surveys provide further evidence that the migration crisis is being used by human trafficking networks to target and exploit the most vulnerable. “There is a need for urgent action to protect these people,” he says. “I believe that a key focus for the UK and other governments must include collaborating with partners to prioritise safeguarding against the risks of modern slavery as part of the response to the migration and refugee crisis.”"
2016-11-28T15:06:06Z,Refugee comedy is German box office sensation,"A comedy about the refugee crisis has become Germany’s biggest homegrown film of the year. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Willkommen bei den Hartmanns (Welcome to the Hartmanns) – which follows a well-to-do woman’s decision to take in an African refugee – has broken the $20m barrier at the German box office. This puts it some distance ahead of the second-placed Der Geilste Tag (The Most Beautiful Day) as the most successful German language film of 2016 at the domestic box office. Willkommen bei den Hartmanns stars Senta Berger as retired headteacher Angelika and Belgian actor Eric Kabongo as Diallo, the Nigerian she meets in a refugee shelter. Angelika’s decision to offer him a home triggers a series of life-changing events in her family. The film makes an explicit reference to Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to welcome large numbers of refugees into Germany. Angelika’s husband, resistant to her plans, at one point says: “It’s enough for Frau Merkel to invite the entire third world into our country – we’re not going to do the same in our home as well.” The film’s director is Simon Verhoeven, Berger’s son with Michael Verhoeven, award-winning director of the 1990 film The Nasty Girl (and no relation to Dutch director Paul Verhoeven)."
2016-11-30T04:57:50Z,Coalition's secret visa plan 'risks increasing violent extremism',"A secret Coalition plan to create a class of provisional visas with less access to social services may undermine resettlement of refugees, reduce social cohesion and increase the risk of violent extremism, according to a leaked government document. Speaking at question time, Malcolm Turnbull acknowledged the authenticity of the “protected” document, first revealed by Fairfax Media on Wednesday, and said the leak had been referred to the Australian federal police. The minute dated 23 November, prepared for the Department of Social Services (DSS) secretary, Finn Pratt, records a meeting with immigration officials at which DSS raised numerous concerns with the plan. Consideration of the proposal began on 1 March when the national security committee of cabinet agreed to a “new simplified visa framework”. The minute said the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was seeking cabinet agreement for a new system with eight types of visas. It discusses a visa change proposal including a “provisional visa system”, and warns that removing or altering the social safety net for those under this system may impact social cohesion and productivity. “DSS is concerned that the proposed reforms risk undermining Australia’s social cohesion and potentially increase the risk factors that may lead to violent extremism,” it said. DSS is working with the immigration department “on costing six options for access to social security payments and identifying associated savings and social impacts”. In the document, DSS recommended that “humanitarian entrants be excluded from any social security changes”, indicating that the proposal under consideration is to alter or remove social security payments or services from visa holders including refugees. It said delayed access to welfare would be harmful to the most vulnerable migrants, such as refugees and those who experienced domestic violence. Social security support was “key to [the] successful long-term settlement” of people on humanitarian visas, it said. The note said the immigration department had begun engaging with other departments on the plan “which will reframe temporary, provisional and permanent migration and citizenship”. But it noted DSS’s concern that “changing the longstanding national narrative to one which treats all migrants with suspicion does not best leverage migrants’ willingness and potential to contribute”. DSS argued that people who opted for a “provisional pathway to permanence” are not the same as temporary residents and should receive “better treatment in terms of payments and supports than those not making any ongoing commitment to Australia”. The minute noted DSS’s concern the proposed timeline for the reform is “too short”. It said that savings may be “not as significant” as the immigration department expected, but the costs would be “huge”. Asked about the document in question time, Turnbull said it was “not a cabinet document” but it was a document “exchanged between bureaucrats” that dealt with matters “to be submitted to cabinet”. “The secretary, Mr Pratt, is conducting an investigation,” he said. Turnbull said the leak should be referred to the AFP then, after question time was delayed by 15 minutes by a noisy and well-coordinated protest by refugee activists, he added he was advised it had now been referred. The Greens immigration spokesman, Nick McKim, said the proposed visa changes discussed in the document are “deeply xenophobic” and a continuation of Dutton’s “attack on multiculturalism in Australia”. “This is nothing less than a blueprint to return our country to the divisive days of the White Australia Policy,” he said. Revelation of the proposed plan comes two weeks after Dutton said it was a “mistake” for Malcolm Fraser to let in certain groups of refugees in the 1970s, later specifying Lebanese Muslims in particular. During the election, Dutton controversially suggested that migrants were illiterate and would take Australian jobs. Senior government figures including Turnbull and deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, defended the remarks, arguing the immigration minister was simply acknowledging the high cost of resettlement services including English classes."

2016-12-17T20:17:56Z,TUC and businesses urge Theresa May to act on rights of migrants,"British business and the trade union movement have made an unprecedented joint demand to Theresa May to guarantee immediately the rights of European Union migrants to remain in the UK, warning that further uncertainty will inflict serious damage on the British economy. In a strongly worded letter to the prime minister, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), representing companies with a combined workforce of 5 million employees, and the TUC say that more delays will be bad for business, families, local communities, and public services, such as the NHS. At an EU summit in Brussels last week, May told EU leaders that she wanted a decision about the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens living in the UK, as well as the more than a million UK residents in other EU states, to be made as soon as possible – but only after formal talks are triggered in March next year. However, in their letter sent to Downing Street on Saturday, the BCC and TUC demand that May “demonstrate leadership” with a “bold move” now that will end the worry and uncertainty for millions of people, and for companies, whose futures have been thrown into doubt by the 23 June Brexit vote. The BCC and TUC say that many EU citizens are already leaving the UK and more will follow unless a decision is made imminently. They say that migrants should no longer be used as bargaining chips in Brexit negotiations, but instead be given “the reassurance we would expect to be shown to UK citizens across the Continent”. In their letter, BCC director general Adam Marshall and TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady say: “The business communities and workers we represent across the United Kingdom share a deep and abiding concern for the rights of EU citizens currently living and working in this country.” They write: “Today, we urge you to break the deadlock – and give an unequivocal commitment that EU citizens working here will have a permanent right to remain in the UK. “We recognise that this would be a bold unilateral move, particularly before the start of a complex Brexit negotiation. But it is the right move for these workers, for the businesses that employ them, for the Exchequer, and for the UK economy as a whole. “It would also send a clear signal to our colleagues and to our European friends that Britain is committed to doing the right thing. Securing EU citizens’ right to remain would provide much-needed certainty for businesses, working people, their families and local communities. “In addition, the government must hold to account the small number of unethical employers who exploit migrant workers to undercut pay and conditions of employment.” So far, the government has stuck to its line that it will not guarantee the rights of European Union migrants in this country until those of British citizens in other EU states are also confirmed. O’Grady told the Observer: “This uncertainty is hugely worrying for working people and their families who have made Britain their home. “It’s the right thing to do. But it’s also about what is right for Britain, too. Continued doubt about the status of workers from the rest of the EU is bad for business, and it puts services like the NHS at risk. “The government must also crack down on the minority of employers who exploit migrants and undercut wages in the local community.” Marshall said: “Business communities across the UK are deeply frustrated that ministers have declined to guarantee the residence rights of their EU employees and colleagues. Some firms are already losing key members of their staff as a result of this avoidable uncertainty.” According to the Office for National Statistics, 2.1 million EU nationals were employed in the UK in the first quarter of 2016 – 224,000 more than in the same period in 2015."
2016-10-20T20:15:10Z,Sonita review – a refugee's dreams of superstardom,"Like many other 18-year-old girls, spirited Sonita Alizadeh wants to be a star and rap about her life. In her dreams, Michael Jackson and Rihanna are her parents and she’s free to pursue her recording career. In reality, as revealed in this wrenching, delicately told documentary, she’s a refugee from Afghanistan living in exile in Tehran, whose while her family back home are arranging to sell her off in matrimony for $9,000. If she won’t go along with the plan, they will beat her until she does, like the families of so many of her friends at the Tehran centre for refugee girls. Her mother is willing to give her a six-month stay of execution if someone like the centre or even the film-makers themselves – like so many Iranian films, this one also operates on a meta level – agree to pay $2,000. Despite the fact it’s illegal for women to sing in public in Iran, eventually Sonita makes a video of one of her songs with help from director Rokhsareh Ghaemmaghami, and that changes the whole story. What’s especially laudable is that the film never oversells her talent: there are scenes of recording industry professionals coolly assessing her work, and telling her she has a lot to learn. But the kid is a force of nature, and it’s impossible not to be swept along by the powerful tide of her story."
2016-12-20T17:07:31Z,Refugees plead with Germans: don't suspect all of us,"Refugees in Berlin have pleaded with their host nation to avoid placing migrants under a blanket of suspicion after police commandos raided their shelter, which had been home to a man arrested over Monday night’s truck attack on a crowded Christmas market. “We are of course worried,” said Ibrahim Sufi, 26, a Syrian living in hangar 7 at the former Tempelhof airport, an imposing structure built by Adolf Hitler to showcase Nazi might and now being used to house migrants. “We are worried about how the German public will view us after this terrorist attack. My message to the Germans is: ‘Don’t suspect everybody, don’t generalise.’” He tucked his hands into his red jacket to keep warm on the freezing morning. Refugees were accosted by dozens of journalists looking for information about Monday night’s police operation, carried out after the attack that killed 12 people. Some kept their eyes to the ground as they left the huge hangars and sped away to language lessons, waving their arms to fend off reporters. “We woke up to shouts in German around 3.30 in the morning,” said Afghan refugee Safihullah, 21, who lives in hangar 6, which was raided by police. “We had no idea what was happening. Security guards told us to stay in. Later they told us there had been a police raid. They said nothing else.” Ali Muhammed, a Syrian who stayed at Hangar 5, said he had slept at a nearby metro station because there had been too much noise at the shelter overnight. “There are many problems here,” he said, including “fighting over food and drink”. Mohammed Jankhan, 23, from Afghanistan, said he recognised the man police initially identified as the prime suspect when he was shown a photograph by the press. Jankhan said had seen the man at Tempelhof over the last three months, that he spoke Farsi and kept himself to himself. “He was a normal guy”. The influx of more than a million migrants into Germany this year and last, mainly Muslims fleeing countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, has hardened public views on immigration and weakened support for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It has also fuelled xenophobia. Authorities in Berlin say they recorded 59 attacks on refugee shelters in the city last year and 48 so far this year. “We have nothing to do with this crime,” said Ammar Wazzaz, a 45-year-old refugee from the Syrian city of Idlib. “I hope that what this person did won’t tarnish the reputation of refugees like us, who are very grateful to Germany.” Yaser, a 32-year-old refugee from Syria, said he became dejected when he read about the attack on Facebook. “We fled this kind of terrorism and it is following us here,” he said.

2016-12-09T01:49:10Z,"Migrant women isolated and vulnerable to domestic abuse, study finds","Australia’s largest study into family violence against migrant women has found they are already isolated by visa restrictions and language barriers, and vulnerable to being controlled by their abusers. The two-year Aspire project – a joint effort by the University of Melbourne, the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health and the University of Tasmania – took in the experiences of 46 immigrant and refugee women, from more than 20 countries, who had survived family violence. Twenty-six focus groups with 223 men and women were held for the study, and nearly 60 workers from family violence, settlement, and the law and justice sectors were interviewed. Cathy Vaughan, of the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Health Equity, who led the study, said many of the women could not work or access social security or health services because of visa restrictions. In many cases, their isolation would be manipulated by their partners, who would forbid them from learning English or how to drive, or choose to live in remote areas. The women also reported extensive financial abuse and coercion over their immigration status. “The process of migration is often associated with isolation because you’re dislocated,” Vaughan told Guardian Australia. ‘That’s compounded when you don’t speak the language of the country that you’re moving to and if you’re completely dependent on someone who sponsored your visa in particular, they’ve got a lot more control in that relationship.” One woman had not been allowed to leave her home for three years, said Vaughan. “She didn’t even know where she lived, let alone who to contact for help,” she said. Another woman arriving in Australia for an arranged marriage was taken to a house in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where the only people she knew were her partner and his family. Within days, she was experiencing severe violence, including being choked. Many of the women were completely dependent on their partner, which made it very difficult for them to leave the relationship, said Vaughan. The cultural backgrounds of abusers varied – some were Anglo-Australians. A bill amending the Migration Act to prevent serious family violence offenders from sponsoring a partner to come to Australia is currently before the Senate. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said it was a “very significant first step in protecting potentially vulnerable visa applicants from the risk of domestic violence”. But Vaughan said, even if the amendment passed, under-reporting of family violence indicated there would still be at-risk women coming to Australia on partner visas. “These men entice women here with false promises and then expect what is essentially domestic servitude,” she said. “Some women end up victims of extreme physical and sexual violence as well – they are essentially brought out here as slaves.” Few women were aware of family violence prevention programs or response services, which were broadly found to be under-resourced and in high demand. Some of those who did seek help reported problems communicating and accessing information, even with the use of interpreters. One woman sought help at a family violence service, telling the interpreter that her husband punched her and made her beg for money. But the interpreter did not translate her words accurately, instead telling her, “You bring shame on our community. I will tell your family you were here.” Many women reported feeling dismissed, disbelieved, blamed and discriminated against by police officers. Adele Murdolo, the executive director of the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health, hoped the findings would prompt community services, and state and federal governments to act decisively to ensure that prevention programs were inclusive and culturally appropriate. Some of the women involved in the study were given cameras to document their work in combating family violence. An exhibition of photographs taken opened in Tasmania on Wednesday and in Melbourne on Friday."
2016-11-07T07:42:49Z,"Somali migrants are 'disaster' for Minnesota, says Donald Trump","Donald Trump on Sunday warned darkly of the danger posed by Somali migrants in Minneapolis, a deeply segregated city that has the largest Somali-American community in the US. “Here in Minnesota, you’ve seen first-hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval,” the Republican nominee told a rally in the solidly Democratic state, two days before the presidential election. He then claimed: “Some of them [are] joining Isis and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world.” “Everybody’s reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota,” he added, before claiming, falsely: “You don’t even have the right to talk about it.” Trump has made warnings about refugees a staple of his stump speech, though he has most commonly targeted Syrians fleeing the five-year civil war that has devastated their country. Three Somali Americans, two US citizens and one a lawful resident, pleaded guilty in June to trying to join the terror group Islamic State, or Isis. Law enforcement officials have said that more than 30 young men from Minnesota have left the county to join Isis or al-Shabaab, which operates in east Africa. According to the 2010 census, more than 85,000 Somali Americans lived in the US with the largest concentration living in the Twin Cities. Despite integration campaigns by the community – a former refugee is poised to win office as a state lawmaker, for instance – the area remains one of the most racially segregated in the US. The Republican nominee has said he would bar refugees from settling in places without the approval of local governments. A federal court ruled against Trump’s running mate, Indiana governor Mike Pence, in October, when he tried to block Syrian refugees from settling in his state. In that decision, judge Richard Posner said Pence’s actions were discriminatory, and “the equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they’re black but because he’s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn’t discriminating”. In Minneapolis on Sunday, Trump said blocking refugees would be “the least [government] can do for you”. “You’ve suffered enough in Minnesota,” he said, “and we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed and until a proven vetting mechanism has been established.” The US has some of the strictest vetting procedures in the world, requiring multiple stages of interviews with security agencies, background and health checks, and the process can last two years. Trump has not specified which countries he would bar migration from, nor many details of what he calls “extreme vetting”. Trump argued that these methods would prevent terror attacks in the US, citing “the recent terrorist attack in St Cloud”. In that Minnesotan city, in September, a 20-year-old Somali American man stabbed eight people in a mall, before being fatally shot by a police officer. The next day, leaders of the Somali community condemned the attack and the FBI said it was investigating it as a “potential act of terror”. It released few details. “It’s horrible what they’re doing and if you want people to pour in Minnesota all you have to do is vote for Hillary Clinton,” Trump said on Sunday. Somali Americans have become a target for domestic terrorists. In September, three members of a militia group were arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb an apartment building in Garden City, Kansas, with a number of Somali-American residents and where one apartment was used as a mosque. The three men arrested could face life in prison. According to the FBI complaint filed against the suspects, the men called themselves “the Crusaders” and Muslims “cockroaches”, and said that they wanted to “wake people up” with “a bloodbath”. This article was amended on 7 November 2016 to clarify that Garden City, Kansas, was the location of the apartment building that was the target of an alleged bomb plot, not the location of the three members of a militia group arrested over the plot."
2016-11-04T15:05:46Z,"French police move 4,000 people out of Paris migrant camp","French authorities have cleared nearly 4,000 people from Paris’s biggest makeshift migrant camp, insisting those moved would be given shelter, food and support, and helped with asylum applications. In a pre-dawn operation, police sealed off the sprawling ad-hoc shanty town of tents and cardboard shelters that stretches for almost 1,000 metres (3,300ft) from under the arches of the Stalingrad Métro bridge. A fleet of 80 buses took men, women, children and groups of unaccompanied minors out of the area. The operation was organised jointly by the state and Paris city authorities. Officials said families and those considered vulnerable would be housed in and around the capital, while lone male migrants would be taken to reception centres around the country. Humanitarian organisations said people were not being told where they were going and that they feared for those not eligible for asylum in France. However, those who jostled to board buses seemed relieved – even happy – to be going. “It would be good to know where we are being taken, but it will be better than sleeping here,” said one woman, who did not wish to be named. The loudest protests came from French campaigners, who shouted insults at police and City Hall chiefs, but the evacuation passed off without violence. Earlier in the week, fights had broken out as tensions rose. Hundreds of CRS riot police carrying shields and batons had arrived at the ad hoc camp at about 6am. They found the camp’s occupants waiting for them. Word had already gone around that the camp would be broken up in an early-morning operation, and many of those living on the street, among them Afghans, Eritreans, Sudanese and Ethiopians, had packed their few belongings into battered suitcases and plastic bags. Some even folded up their tents and stood waiting, duvets draped around their shoulders to keep out the morning chill. The scene was already bleak; then it began to rain. Locals and humanitarian organisations handed out baguettes and biscuits to women and toddlers, who were given priority on the buses. Marine, 28, an actor living nearby, said she had been visiting the Stalingrad camp for six months. “It wasn’t possible to just sit at home while there was all this misery around me. I felt I had to do something. Many of the migrants were people my own age and we formed a strong bond. Today, I’m afraid for them.” The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, turned up to support the clearance and spoke to a group of Eritrean teenagers, standing out of the rain in a bus shelter waiting to be evacuated. “Do you have houses for us?” one 16-year-old asked in broken English. The mayor reassured them they would be given a roof over their heads. Hidalgo said breaking up the squalid open-air camp was essential. Finding accommodation for the thousands camped at Stalingrad would enable the authorities to start with a clean slate and control the flow of new refugees in the French capital – estimated at 80 a day – in a “humane manner”, she added. A new reception centre will open in the north of Paris next week. “Paris attracts people, but the problem is one that the whole of France needs to deal with. We cannot have camps of this nature in the city. We cannot have people living in such dirty, undignified circumstances,” Hidalgo told the Guardian. “These people need a proper place to sleep. How on earth can refugees or migrants think about their futures if they’ve had no sleep, or been sleeping on the street, and have had nothing to eat. Once they have a roof over their heads, they can reflect on what they will do.” She also praised local residents for their “patience and solidarity”. Alain Guillo, who lives in the 18th arrondissement, said residents and refugees had existed in “deplorable health conditions” in recent months. The number of migrants living rough increased to a record number after the closure of the Calais camp last week. Despite about 30 attempts to move people on and clear the area in the last 18 months, they have always returned. “In the end, it grew so large that it was no longer a refugee camp in a district, it was a district inside a refugee camp. What we wanted was dignity for all: residents and refugees,” Guillo said."
2016-11-03T17:47:20Z,"After her arrest, the ‘Afghan Girl’ is once again a symbol of refugees’ plight | Steve McCurry","I first encountered Sharbat Gula in 1984, in Pakistan, when she was an orphan living in a refugee camp just outside of Peshawar with her grandmother and siblings. One of the photographs I took of her became known around the world as Afghan Girl. She became the face of refugees for many years. Today, more than three decades later and despite having one of the most famous faces on the planet, Sharbat Gula is still a displaced person – one who is now facing up to 14 years in prison for the same reasons that brought her to a refugee camp all those years ago. With her arrest last week for living illegally in Pakistan and her current imprisonment, she is now being made into a symbol of unwanted migrants around the world. Gula is one of the estimated 3 million Afghan refugees who currently reside in Pakistan. A widow and an orphan, she has lived in the country virtually all her adult life. She has endeavoured to raise her four children alone. She represents all the brave women and men who will endure any pain and hardship to protect the most precious thing they have – their children. Last week authorities from Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency raided her apartment and arrested her for allegedly having false identity documents. She could face deportation, prison and fines of up to $5,000. Her bail has been denied. I find Gula’s treatment by the authorities impossible to understand. They seem to want to humiliate her, and appear to have gone out of their way to treat her with disrespect. Hundreds of thousands of other Afghan refugees face the same situation. The United Nations Refugee Agency has estimated there are 1 million unregistered Afghans living in Pakistan. Gula’s situation is not unique, and in the media circus of the past week it seems she has already been tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion. The strength of the picture I took, its success, has to do with Sharbat Gula and her expression: her eyes and their gaze, that fierce look of dignity and determination. It’s an honour to be the photographer who took that iconic picture. It has stood the test of time, which is a testament to the picture, but mostly to Gula herself. Seventeen years later, I went looking for her and was reunited with her, and it was extraordinary. I was thrilled that she was still alive. Gula didn’t know that her picture had been published all over the world, but in time she understood. She did remember that I took her picture that day because it was the first time in her life that she had been photographed. The second time was when I was reunited with her. That fact reminds me of what one of her relatives told CBS News this week, that she is a “simple, illiterate lady” who may not understand legal documents. For over a decade, she didn’t realise that millions of people knew her face. Gula’s relative said that she was set to return to her father’s village in Afghanistan this summer, but had been delayed because of the supposed presence of Islamic State elements nearby. The raid on her home last week was, I believe, politically motivated. Many believe she was targeted. As her face once symbolised the hopes of countless refugees, the image of her post-arrest mugshot circulated last week was meant to instil fear into other refugees – and to turn the minds of others against the migrant population. When I first saw that arrest shot, I was saddened by the apparent attempt to humiliate and debase her; but at the same time, I saw that same gaze I first glimpsed decades ago in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp, when an orphan girl stared back at my lens with a proud, haunted look. Sharbat Gula’s face, now older, is once again a symbol of the refugee’s plight."
2016-09-14T11:07:25Z,"UK not doing enough for refugees, say charities and aid agencies","A group of 50 leading refugee charities and aid agencies has condemned the government’s record on the refugee crisis, describing the support offered by the UK as “not enough – not even close”. In a letter to the prime minister before two crucial international refugee summits, which Theresa May is due to attend, the charities state that the global response so far has been inadequate. “Of course, the commitment by David Cameron to resettle 23,000 refugees by 2020 is a welcome step in the right direction. But it is not enough – not even close – as hundreds of thousands of refugees remain in desperate need,” the letter, signed by Oxfam, the Children’s Society and Christian Aid, among others, states. The charities call on the UK government to adopt three commitments during next week’s talks in the US, requesting that the UK should take a leading role in “developing a humane, coordinated international response to the millions fleeing crisis”, offer safe passage to more refugees, in part by removing obstacles to family reunification, and commit to providing better support for those refugees who reach the UK so they can rebuild their lives here. May is due to to attend the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants next Monday and the US Leaders’ Summit on Refugees on Tuesday. The letter is designed to showcase the strength and unanimity of feeling among relevant organisations before a refugee solidarity march scheduled to take place in central London on Saturday. Kate Allen, the director of Amnesty International, one of the letter’s signatories, said: “History will judge us for our failure to deal with the global refugee crisis. Instead of focusing on putting up more barriers to keep people out, the UK must urgently provide the safe and legal routes refugees fleeing violence and persecution desperately need.” The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Maurice Wren, said: “The prime minister has the chance to lead by example – by offering more refugees safe passage and encouraging other countries to do the same. The time for prevarication and evasion is over; world leaders must make sharing responsibility for protecting refugees their number one priority.” World leaders attending Monday’s refugee summit will consider how best to respond to “an unprecedented level of human mobility”, with an estimated 65 million people forcibly displaced in 2015, including 21 million refugees. They will discuss signing up to a draft declaration that acknowledges that refugees are facing a “desperate ordeal” and pledges that the international community’s challenge is “above all moral and humanitarian”. “We are determined to save lives” and “combat with all the means at our disposal the abuses and exploitation suffered by countless refugees and migrants in vulnerable situations”, the draft document states. The letter to the prime minister reminds her that a year ago 100,000 people marched through London to register their dismay at the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned as his family fled to safety, “sending a clear message that this country must not stand by while children drown in Europe’s seas”. The continuation of the crisis, a year later, reflects “the inadequacy of the international community’s response until now, and its failure to address the root causes”, the letter states, adding that unless constructive action is taken by the government “we too will be party to that failure”. A government spokesperson defended the government’s record, stating: “This government has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. We have pledged £2.3bn in humanitarian aid to Syria and neighbouring countries and providing nearly £70m in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis.”"
2016-12-13T17:31:03Z,Pensioner presents every MP with collection of refugee stories,"An October excursion to a local bookshop by a pensioner and human rights activist has this week ended in MPs receiving a Christmas gift she hopes will challenge the rhetoric surrounding refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. At the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, Michaela Fyson from Staffordshire handed over copies – one for each MP – of A Country of Refuge, with help from the book’s editor, Lucy Popescu. The event was attended by MPs, members of the Lords, writers and refugees. A mixture of specially commissioned fiction, memoir, poetry and essays, A Country of Refuge was created “to make a positive and vital contribution to the national debate and to foster a kinder attitude towards our fellow humans who are fleeing violence, persecution, poverty or intolerance,” Popescu said. Fyson said she was inspired to give the gifts to MPs after buying a copy of the book in her local bookshop. She said: “The idea of influencing the tone of the debate around refugees and asylum seekers came to me when I read the introduction. I thought, I need to act on this. “There are too many politicians referring to these groups of people as if they are animals – talking about them ‘swarming’, or needing their teeth checked like horses to see how old they are. That is what we need to change.” Sebastian Barry, one of the contributors to the anthology, whose Fragment of a Journal, Author Unknown investigates an earlier migration by people fleeing the Irish Famine, who crossed the Atlantic in “coffin ships”, said:“If we don’t honour the redemptive fact that all modern humans belong to the same family, and that therefore the children who have been abandoned in France are our children and our urgent responsibility, then there is no justice, and no human history to be proud of.” Mirroring the book’s route to market, Fyson crowdfunded buying the 650 copies needed. “I had to get the money together in a great rush,” the 71-year-old said. “I did it through a network of people: friends and friends of friends. Some gave a few pennies others several hundreds of pounds. Everyone was incredibly generous.” Fyson has spent her life campaigning for refugee causes after a Hungarian refugee came to live with her family in 1956. She said that MPs would be contacted after Christmas to make sure they have read the book. Help with her task has come from unexpected sources. “When the books were delivered they arrived in a great pantechnicon in the middle of my village,” she explained. “The driver said he had to leave the pallet with all the books on it on the pavement, but when I told him what they were for, he helped get them inside. People have been so generous and supportive.” Popescu was inspired to curate the collection two years ago after hearing the rhetoric being used to demonise refugees and asylum seekers in the media and by politicians. Her aim was to encourage compassion and empathy, she said Though writers asked to contribute to the collection had been supportive, publishers were less enthusiastic, Popescu said. “This was before the Syrian refugee crisis, and none of the big publishers would touch it,” she added. “My agent went to every major publisher in town and everyone said that a short-story collection about refugees wouldn’t sell.” Crowdfunding publishing house Unbound picked up the title. A second volume, focused on the experiences of refugee children, is planned for next year, Popescu added. “We want to get it onto the school curriculum and into school libraries. I am doing a call out now to children’s authors to get them involved.”"
2016-10-04T12:45:51Z,'The question was stupid': Hungarians on the refugee referendum,"More than 98% of Hungarians who took to the polls in Sunday’s referendum voted to close the door to refugees. However more than half of the electorate didn’t vote rendering the process constitutionally null and void. We asked our readers what they thought of the result and why more people didn’t vote. Here’s what some of you said. ‘Orbán poses a greater danger than people may realise’ I didn’t vote because not voting helped to nullify the result. Thus I am very happy things turned out the way they did. Orbán poses a greater danger than people may realise. He sows strife and conflict within the EU where he wants to divide and rule in his bid for ever greater power. Orbán is not just a disaster in Hungary, but a very real and dangerous presence in the EU. I cannot understand why the EU continues to just sit on its hands, while one of its member countries flouts almost all the regulations and rules of its membership. The EU was founded not just on a free and open market economy, but its other raison d’etre was the dissemination and development of democratic norms and principles. Orbán has used these democratic systems to to undermine democracy itself and as he proudly proclaims, to create an illiberal country where he has become an oligarch. Anonymous, 67-year-old from Budapest ‘I don’t agree with this demagogy’ I did not participate in this referendum by voting yes or no. I voted invalidly by marking all the possible options in order to spoil my vote. I did this because I wanted to show that I don’t agree with this demagogy. I don’t think the quota is the right solution to handle the refugee crisis because I think a strong checkpoint is needed at the borders. But this referendum was not really about asking a question - it was about power. It was a survey of whether the Hungarian government would have enough voters in 2018 or not. I am not surprised by the result though I thought the referendum would be valid. I think people decided not to vote because they are fed up with the old world - the authoritarian governments of the past of Hungary. On the other hand, maybe people just did not care about the question. Attila Benke, 30-year-old living in Tura ‘I’m very disappointed by the result’ I voted no because I believe in a democratic society. Every person has the right to privacy and to be able to live with who they wish. I do not believe countries outside Europe should be able to force themselves into a country or countries where they do not belong. I am not a racist and I believe the world should look after genuine refugees but not economic migrants. I’m very disappointed by the result. The referendum was not meant to be political, but a way of legally finding out how the people in Hungary feel about the migration situation. I think people refused to vote as a way of trying to get Obán Viktor out of office. Máté Pál, 72-year-old living in the north west of Hungary ‘More people should have spoiled their ballots’ I voted by spoiling my ballot. I remember last year when a large crowd of people marched on the street near where I live. They wanted to go to western Europe and when the government banned them from going by train they just set off on foot. I had mixed feelings about them. They were determined, but I also felt like they were being arrogant in the way they left trash all over the road and seemed like they absolutely didn’t care about the citizens of Hungary. Despite all of this I wouldn’t mind if a few people, in moderate numbers, were to resettle in Hungary. I chose to vote in the referendum but I put a cross in both circles, because I think Orbán’s time is up. It seems like power has overcome him and, if allowed, would continue to dismantle democracy and the constitutional state if re-elected. So, in my opinion, this referendum wasn’t really about the EU quota but more about the political mood of the country. I would be a lot happier if more people had spoiled their ballots. This would have been an obvious message - that the referendum question was improper. I think very few people voted because they thought the question was stupid, and believed there to be no correct answer. However, in Hungary this kind of turnout is pretty average.

2016-12-06T15:38:21Z,Labour has never had an open-door immigration policy | Diane Abbott,"One of the great myths of public life in the UK is that we are not allowed to talk about immigration, yet an objective observer might feel we talk about little else. At the heart of the debate, there has been a pervasive “post-truth” narrative that Labour governments operated an open-door immigration policy – one that they maintain in opposition today. But no British government has ever had an open-door immigration policy, Labour, Conservative or otherwise. Historically, the main driving force for immigration to this country has been government policy powered by an economic necessity within the UK. We need migrant workers. There have of course been frequent periods of war and upheaval which have produced large numbers of refugees – the Syria crisis is just the latest example of this. A widely known example is the “Windrush generation” of migrants arriving from the Caribbean, starting with the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948. These migrants were invited to come here. The postwar labour shortage, the tasks of reconstruction and the continuation of conscription all meant that migrants were making a vital contribution to the economy, both the private and public sectors – without even mentioning the ways in which they enriched the cultural life of the country. This was true of Irish immigration from the mid-19th century onwards and many less well known influxes of labour, including overseas workers to the south Wales coal fields towards the turn of 20th century. About the same time, Russians and Poles also settled in Scotland, taking up work in the mines and in the tailoring and catering trades. The Jewish population of Scotland grew dramatically, partly as a result – though it still stands at around 0.1% of the population. All of these enriched the whole of society, materially and culturally. Yet over time immigration rules have only become tighter. For all those Commonwealth citizens who were initially told they were entitled to come here but have since been blocked, or for those separated from loved ones by arcane rules separating families, the notion that Britain has an open-door immigration policy will produce hollow laughter. In the 14 years before 2010 there were 91 policy or legislative changes on some aspect of immigration. Virtually all of them tightened immigration access. The coalition and the current Tory government were not to be outdone. In a little over six years, there have been a further 209 such changes. This legislative frenzy has always been cast in terms of controlling numbers or, even more fruitlessly, in the case of Theresa May, reducing numbers. Immigration is growing in the UK, just as it is in France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and a host of European and other countries, because migrants are needed and because people want to migrate. At times we have introduced controls that undermine our own prosperity. Recently, universities, farmers and the NHS have all reported difficulties in recruiting from Europe. As business, government, markets and labour forces become more international these trends will only continue. Without immigration in some parts of the country we would face a serious crisis: we have a rapidly ageing population, yet would be unable to staff public services, attract financial expertise, or even process potatoes. Labour does not have an open-door immigration policy, it never has. Labour is for fair migration policies that benefit the population as a whole, plus a policy of investment that will improve the living standards for the overwhelming majority of people."
2016-09-21T13:45:56Z,Migrant boat capsizes off Egyptian coast,"Dozens of people have died and officials fear hundreds more have been lost at sea after a boat carrying 600 migrants capsized off the north Egyptian coast, as world leaders gathered at a summit in New York to discuss the refugee crisis. Rescuers have brought more than 150 people ashore and recovered 43 bodies, including several women and a child, and hundreds more are missing, according to local officials and news agencies said. “We are deeply concerned at reports that hundreds of people may be missing at sea,” said Matthew Saltmarsh, spokesman for the United Nation’s refugee agency, UNHCR. “Events like this highlight the importance of rescue operations as part of the response to the movement of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean and the need for real, safer alternatives for people needing international protection.” Like most boats used for human trafficking, the ship that sank not far off the Egyptian coast appeared to have been dangerously overloaded, security officials said. Smugglers operating from Egypt often use old fishing boats for the long journey to Italy. Manypassengers are crammed below deck, with little chance of surviving if the boat sinks. “Initial information indicates that the boat sank because it was carrying more people than its limit. The boat tilted and the migrants fell into the water,” a senior security official in northern Beheira province told Reuters. He said the dead were mostly Egyptian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali nationals. Relatives of missing Egyptians gathered at a coastguard post to wait for news within hours of the tragedy. “I am not going to leave until I see Mohamed,” Ratiba Ghonim told Reuters, as she mourned her 16-year-old brother. “It is his destiny to leave yesterday and come back dead today. They still haven’t pulled his body out of the water.” The tragedy is part of a growing human trafficking problem out of the country. Neighbouring Libya is still the starting point for most efforts to reach Italy by boat from north Africa but, after years of lawless chaos in the region, a rising number of people are setting out from Egypt instead. In the first seven months of this year, Italian data showed that the number of migrants who reached the country by boat from Egypt was nearly 70% higher than the same period of last year. Arrivals from Libya fell slightly. A safer embarkation point has not made the journey itself any less perilous. Thousands of people have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean, with nearly 3,000 dead or missing in the first eight months of this year, according to UN data. The deadliest month was May, when hundreds of people died in three separate incidents that overwhelmed rescuers. In June, more than 300 migrants who had set off from Egypt died when their boat capsized near Crete. Rescue services are patchy, a mix of privately funded operations and an EU anti-smuggling mission that helps out with rescues when needed, but is not officially assigned to search and rescue operations. Charities have warned that the Mediterranean is becoming a “mass grave” as Europe looks away from tragedy. Crossings from Turkey to Greece fell dramatically after an EU-Turkey pact earlier this year, that aimed to deter prospective migrants by promising the deportation of most people arriving through that route. Several thousand people are still risking that voyage each month and experts say only the prospect of safe and effective resettlement schemes will stem the flow of people risking their lives. At the summit in New York this week, the US president, Barack Obama, announced that a coalition of more than 30 countries had agreed to concrete measures to tackle the refugee crisis. They include a commitment to double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5bn, provide education to 1 million more refugee children and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults."
2016-12-12T00:53:51Z,We can fight hate and racism by telling the stories of migrants | Dan Cass,"This was the year when racism seemed to suddenly grow into a powerful political project, in Europe and America. When Donald Trump was elected he was cheered on by the KKK and neo-Nazis. Sadly, some conservative Australian politicians act as the shock troops for race hate. Rather than building understanding, their strategy is division; they bang on about how Australia used to be a great place to be a racist. (The attorney general, George Brandis, used the term “bigot” but we know what he meant.) Literature and the law are two very different responses to hate speech and my late sister embodied both. Deborah Cass was a legal academic at the London School of Economics. She loved working in the law and published important scholarship. She believed in the better side of our shared humanity, and the possibility of making a better world. She fought for the underdog and defeated bullies. If the law was the great love of Deborah’s hard working intellect, it was literature that was her first love. As a teenager she read and reread the Greek myths. After falling ill she retired from the law and took up writing fiction. She had some short writing published and started on a novel. As a young girl Deborah was shy, so our parents made her a little theatre, to help build her confidence. Dad constructed a wooden stage and Mum sewed on a curtain and fashioned a family of glove puppets. Deborah would act out little plays, literally trying on different characters. She found a strong voice for herself, by imagining other people. Empathy made her strong. Deborah died in 2013 at 53 years of age after a long and courageous struggle with cancer. She lived life with vigour but we knew there was much left undone and wanted to remember her with a prize in her name. We thought hard about what it should be. How do you pay tribute to a life? We chose in the end to go with her heart not her head, and decided to create a prize for writers not lawyers. Deborah’s family and friends resolved that her prize should explore the migrant experience, as this would reflect her life and her values. She was the granddaughter of Jewish migrants who came to Australia early last century, as a safe haven from European antisemitism. The Deborah Cass Prize goes to new writing, by early career authors, who must have a migrant background. Our criterion for eligibility is that the author must either be born overseas or have at least one parent who was. Around 40% of the people in Australia are migrants themselves or the child of a migrant. Writers Victoria administers and promotes the prize. The Australian story is largely a story of migration and its aftermath. Refugees and those simply seeking a better life shaped our nation, enriched the culture and made a vast contribution to the economy, as labour, consumers and entrepreneurs. In the USA it is estimated that more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. In Australia, the haters – and their fellow travellers – keep prosecuting a tired old debate about whether to dismantle a law that was designed to reveal and condemn hate speech. As a lawyer, I bet Deborah would support using the law to sanction against hate speech. But as a humanist, I think she would have taken a broader view and argued that we must cultivate empathy. Of course we ought to condemn the most hateful speech. But surely our vision and thus our work should be in understanding different races and cultures. We need not just litigators but storytellers. Hate is not only a political strategy, it is a failure of imagination, a lack of empathy. We can’t legislate for imagination, we can only do what people have always done: tell new stories, build better worlds in the theatre of the mind. This year is the second year of the prize and the judging panel is again made up of three great writers: Tony Ayers, Alice Pung and Christos Tsiolkas. The judges are evidence – if you need it – that migrant communities give us wonderful stories and strong voices, enriching Australia to the benefit of everyone. The 2016 Deborah Cass Writing Prize will be awarded on 6pm, Tuesday 13 December at Centre for Contemporary Photography, 404 George Street Fitzroy."
2016-11-22T16:02:24Z,Five ways to help migrant children settle in your class,"The issue of migration is rarely out of the news at the moment, but migration is nothing new to the UK. Despite having decades to ensure policy and practice helps migrant pupils settle and feel included, research shows that migrant pupils in our schools have varying experiences of education. Migrant children will often have travelled a long way, possibly in difficult circumstances. They will probably be tackling language and cultural barriers, and then they have to get to grips with the expectations of a new teacher. So what can educators do to make this process as smooth as possible?Let them be the experts Migrant children are the experts on their own lives; the best way to find out about them – their previous experiences, their interests, likes and dislikes – is to ask them. For example, children from the Middle East may want to contribute during RE lessons about Islam; some will know more than the teacher. Rather than seeing this as a challenge to your authority, be ready to draw on their knowledge (and don’t get flustered when they correct your pronunciation of “Qur’an”). Treat them as experts, get to know them as human beings, and encourage everyone else in the class to do the same. Represent them Our experience has shown that a crucial question in multi-ethnic schools is whether students can “see themselves” in the “story” of the curriculum. The key to including migrant children is for teachers to be creative with the curriculum, choosing topics to reflect the range of children’s cultural identities and experiences. This can build confidence and a sense of pride in their home countries while offering valuable learning opportunities for their classmates. If you have a new child from Rwanda, for example, why not use your geography lessons to focus on the Rwandan rainforests? Being inclusive with parents is equally important; drawing on their knowledge can build stronger school-home links and help to include them in the school community. Get creative To engage migrant learners with the curriculum, we need to build their understanding in ways other than the “literal” – that which requires language. Picture books are a way to level the playing field for learners with different abilities in English. These books can tell complex stories that require little or no proficiency in English to enjoy. The Arrival by Shaun Tan, for example, is a beautifully illustrated but wordless book that tells a strange tale of migration and discovery: it is the perfect starting point for talking about journeys. Armin Greder, David Weisner and Anthony Browne write similarly engaging yet accessible books. Dance, art, drama and music are ideal avenues for engaging non-English speakers. As well as tapping into rich seams of cultural tradition, they can be a welcome relief from using words and an opportunity for non-English speakers to shine. Encourage collaboration Enabling migrant children to work together means that they can share linguistic and emotional knowledge – they may have been through similar experiences. This could mean buddying up children who have the same home language in class or at playtime, but sometimes it does not even require a shared spoken language – we often find that children are much more creative than we are in being able to communicate with each other, such as when a new arrival from Latvia was described by a less-new-arrival from Sudan as being “really funny” despite neither of them understanding a word of what the other way saying. But avoid grouping all EAL pupils together all the time – the children we speak to tell us that they want to mix it up sometimes. Don’t underestimate them A fundamental reminder: although it is important to consider the additional things we need to do to support migrant children, we should not underestimate them or think their academic abilities are the same as their English language skills. These children may be high-achievers in their home countries and their level of literacy in English may not necessarily reflect their capability overall. Don’t let lack of English language literacy be a barrier – you may have the next Nobel Laureate in your class.

2016-10-20T14:29:27Z,Calais migrant children cover their faces as they arrive in UK,"Some of the latest unaccompanied refugee children to travel from Calais to London covered their faces as they arrived, following a row about the ages of the first teenagers to be rescued. Their attempt to conceal their faces on Thursday came amid frustration from campaigners that the Home Office has not done enough to protect the anonymity of those being helped. Fourteen children arrived at an immigration centre in Croydon, south London, on Thursday morning, before the camp in Calais is expected to be demolished on Monday. Among the group were five boys aged 12 to 14. There were also six boys and three girls described as slightly older teenagers. Six youngsters, including all the girls, covered their heads and faces in towels as they were greeted by reporters and photographers. More than 50 of over 1,000 children in the camp have arrived in the UK under a programme to resettle unaccompanied minors. The latest group were the first to cover their faces, according to volunteers. James Asfa, a community organiser with Citizens UK – which is helping coordinate the arrival of the children – said: “The first few children came out without covers. The second group didn’t want to be photographed but there was a concern the photographers would continue despite being asked not to by volunteers so they put blankets over themselves just before they got off the bus for protection.” Another source working with the children said: “Lots of them don’t want the invasive photography that some of their peers had earlier in the week.” Media coverage of the first arrivals and a call by the Tory MP David Davies to force them to undergo dental or hand x-rays to verify their ages have been widely criticised. Josie Naughton, the co-founder of Help Refugees, urged the Home Office to do more to protect the identities of the children. “Exposing them to the media is disrespectful and hugely unkind. The media attention makes the public think the government is doing something, that the crisis is over. It isn’t. [Fewer] than 100 children have come to the UK this week and there are thousands more. “These children’s lives are their own and not public property. There are laws protecting children in the UK. Why isn’t it the same for them? It is super important to remember these are vulnerable children fleeing war and conflict and unimaginable experiences. They deserve privacy and respect.” The Home Office said in a statement: “Our focus is, and will continue to be, transferring eligible children and young people from Calais to the UK before the camp clearance begins. We urge everyone, including the media, to respect the privacy of these vulnerable individuals.” Security outside the Home Office building was significantly increased as the fourth group of child refugees prepared to leave. By Thursday afternoon, screens, yellow tape and metal fences had been erected around the exit, in a belated attempt to protect the identities of the children. Despite the increased security no children were seen leaving the building by that exit, instead leaving separately with volunteers. Meanwhile, the fostering and adoption charity Tact has distanced itself from a claim on its Twitter account that concerned the status of a male widely pictured on stories about the refugee children arriving in Britain. After the Sun and other newspapers suggested the male was an asylum seeker, the tweet claimed he was an interpreter instead. The Home Office confirmed on Thursday that the man was not one of its interpreters. And Tact said in a statement: “Our information was from a credible source. However, if the male is indeed a migrant and not an interpreter, Tact regrets any concern caused. The tweet has now been withdrawn as we do not want to cause any further distress to the individual depicted.”"
2016-10-17T19:57:44Z,The UK must fulfil its moral duty to Calais’ unaccompanied children | Bernard Cazeneuve,"The issue of the Calais camp and the situation of the migrants has sparked conflict between public opinion in the UK and France. Our two countries are attached to broadly the same values and the same goals: respecting the right to asylum and regulating migration, while honouring both treaty and moral obligations. But we need to find a common outlook on the current position in Calais if we are to avoid passing between us the blame for a situation that everyone agrees is a disaster. From the point of view of some in France, the Calais migrants’ misery is entirely down to the selfishness of the British government. London, they believe, is hiding behind the Le Touquet agreements governing controls on entry from continental Europe to the UK. They accuse the UK of using these agreements in an unscrupulous way, as a means of refusing to take in refugees fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, including unaccompanied children with family connections in the UK. Conversely, the British press is quick to accuse the French government of inefficiency as well as inhumanity. We are accused of being too slow to process asylum applications, and of being indifferent to the human stories behind each set of forms. The reality, of course, is that neither government has chosen to leave people with the right to refugee status in the cold and the mud – women and children least of all. Over the past year, 6,000 people have been moved from the Calais and Dunkirk camps to 164 reception and guidance centres the French government has opened throughout France, with the aim of integrating the migrants into their host towns. This method has been proved to work, and its success is the reason why the French government has now decided to dismantle the Calais camp for good. Because they share a moral responsibility towards them, the governments of France and the UK are determined to succeed with this operation together. Our countries must act together to shelter those people who are on their border and who clearly need protection – above all the most vulnerable among them. The British government has pledged to help solve this crisis by taking in some unaccompanied minors, the vast majority of whom have expressed the wish to go to the UK. Because they share a moral responsibility towards them, the governments of France and the UK are determined to succeed with this operation together. Our countries must act together to shelter those people who are on their border and who clearly need protection – above all the most vulnerable among them. The UK government now needs to intensify this effort, so that every unaccompanied minor can benefit from fair, lasting protection. The first transfers of young people with close relatives in the UK begin this week, while France has agreed to take in 13,000 refugees. The British government now needs to intensify its efforts to identify and resettle child migrants. This humanitarian operation must be supported by long-term measures aimed at making the border impenetrable at Calais and other Channel ports – because if the border is porous, people-smuggling rings will exploit their weaknesses to hold out to their victims the possibility of an illegal crossing to the UK, hiding from them the mortal risks to which they will expose themselves on the way. The UK government has already done a great deal to support us in these efforts. Thanks to the cooperation between our police services, 33 illegal immigration networks smuggling people into the UK have already been dismantled in France since the beginning of this year. In the longer term, neither the UK nor France can abdicate our responsibilities regarding the migration crisis across our continent. For obvious geographical reasons, ours are not countries of first entry like Greece and Italy, or even the countries most affected, in terms of flows of refugees. But the UK is the country that invented habeas corpus and France is the country that proclaimed the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen. We also each exercise singular international responsibilities, stemming from our history, defence capabilities and status as permanent members of the UN security council. As such, we must not just prevent migrants from living in precarious conditions on our soil, be it in the area around Calais or on the Kent coast. We must also act together to ensure that refugees aspiring to gain asylum in Europe are dealt with in conditions of solidarity and humanity, in a manner in keeping with the history and the values of our two countries."
2016-11-17T22:19:07Z,US detention facility restricts use of crayons for migrant children,"Young migrant children held in one of the most controversial privatised detention centres in the US have been restricted from playing with crayons after staff members accused them of causing damage to property. The move has been branded as unnecessarily punitive by lawyers working on behalf of 600 mothers and children detained at the Karnes detention centre in Texas. The centre at Karnes is one of three federal facilities that holds migrant mothers and children. These family centres are one of the most controversial elements of the Obama administration’s border protection program, which looks set to rapidly expand under the incoming Donald Trump presidency. A spokeswoman for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), which provides pro bono legal support to detainees at Karnes, said detention centre staff enforced the ban after accusing children of damaging a table as they drew inside the prison’s visitation centre last week. The damage is said to have occurred as some mothers were taking legal advice. In email correspondence seen by the Guardian, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staff state the punishment was “an action resulting from crayons which RAICES staff/volunteers have given children which has caused property damage to the contractor”. The GEO group, the $2bn global security company that operates the centre, has made over $57m from it since November last year, according to local media reports. A spokesman for GEO group said “crayons, toys and books etc” were provided to children in other sectors of the detention centre, and the restriction only affected children playing in the visitors area. Barbara Hines an adjunct professor at the University of Texas and RAICES member said in a letter to ICE that the reaction was disproportionate. “Treating a child’s color markings as ‘destruction of property’ is altogether inappropriate. And such markings are a cost that comes with the detention of children. It is extremely disturbing that ICE’s concern for GEO’s property takes precedence over the well being of the children and their mothers’ rights to legal advice,” she wrote. In an emailed statement, one 23-year-old detained mother said banning her children from drawing with crayons was already having an adverse effect. “They are too young to read and if they just play can get too rowdy.

2016-07-13T15:02:10Z,EU officials finalise common asylum system to resettle refugees,"European officials have finalised plans to create a common EU asylum system and refugee resettlement scheme, which advocates portray as the solution to the European migration crisis but which critics believe will be a further betrayal of refugee rights. Officials have proposed creating a semi-standardised system that would allow asylum seekers to expect similar treatment in whichever country they settle. The arrival of more than 1 million people in Europe in 2015 exposed differences between the continent’s different asylum procedures. It is hoped that the proposed system would discourage the kind of country-hopping that saw hundreds of thousands of refugees settle in Germany last year having passed through other European countries such as Hungary and Greece. The plans also include the establishment of a common European policy on refugee resettlement. The policy’s proposers say it could allow Europe to resettle thousands of refugees through legal means, and so discourage the unusually high levels of irregular migration seen in 2015. Commenting on the resettlement scheme, the EU’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said: “Today’s proposal is a major step in our efforts to offer legal avenues to allow persons in need to enter the EU safely and receive protection. It is an integral part of the larger objective of ensuring that protection is offered to those who need it, reducing the incentives for irregular migration, and protecting migrants from exploitation by smuggling networks and dangerous journeys to reach Europe.” But other European officials and rights campaigners criticised the proposals, which they said would in reality lead to fewer refugees being given sanctuary in Europe. Under the plan, refugees will only be formally resettled in Europe from third countries that agree to readmit migrants who arrived in Europe by informal means. Additionally, the plans make it easier for refugees to be expelled from Europe in the first place. Brussels would be given greater say over which countries are deemed safe for refugees – overriding the wishes of independent appeals boards in nation states. In the current context, this would theoretically allow the EU to expel more people from Greece to Turkey, despite Greek officials deeming Turkey unsafe for some refugees. Expanding on these criticisms, John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Europe director, said: “The proposals the commission published today are not about improving refugee protection globally, but about reducing irregular arrivals to Europe. They take good tools, like resettlement, and put them to bad ends; they use fine words, but these mask some pretty cynical intentions.” Dalhuisen added: “What the commission is really trying to do with these proposals is resettle some refugees so they can return more. In the absence of any mention of the need to significantly increase resettlement numbers and heavily invest in conditions for refugees in third countries, the net impact of these proposals for refugee protection globally is very likely to be negative.” Malin Björk, the European parliament’s rapporteur on the proposal, called it “disgraceful”. The Swedish politician said: “As the parliament’s rapporteur, I will do what I can to stop this distortion of the international right to asylum and the notion of global responsibility and solidarity.” The draft law is likely to be amended by EU home affairs ministers and the European parliament, who will determine the final legislation. Politicians have dwindling confidence in the viability of common European asylum policies due to the failure of their previous incarnations. Last September, European leaders promised to relieve Greece and Italy of 160,000 refugees stranded on their territory. On Wednesday the EU admitted that member states had accepted just 3,056 – nearly 10 months after promising to help out. Only 8,268 refugees have been resettled directly from the Middle East, despite a promise almost a year ago to resettle 22,504."
2016-11-02T19:29:29Z,Australia could double annual migration by 2054 and boost economy – report,"Australia could double its annual permanent migration over the next 40 years and reap significant economic benefits for the average person, according to a new report. But it could do so only with better long-term planning around population growth, with policies focused on infrastructure provision, urban congestion and environmental degradation. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) has released a report, “Migration: the economic debate”. It makes 17 recommendations to improve Australia’s migration program, saying changes are required to ensure it remains one of the best programs in the world. Bureau of Statistics figures show net overseas migration in 2014-15 recorded an annual increase of 168,200 people. Net overseas migration is the net gain or loss of population through immigration to Australia and emigration from Australia. But Ceda said that figure could rise to 400,000 by 2054, bringing beneficial economic consequences, if important changes were made to the program. Stephen Martin, the chief executive of Ceda, said Australia’s migration program had strong community support, but key aspects had the potential to undermine that support. “Concern over migration both domestically and internationally has been increasing, driven by fear-mongering coupled with genuine community (albeit misplaced) concern about security,” Martin said. “Public policy improvements are needed to ensure previous strong community support for migration is re-established, fair treatment for both temporary and permanent migrants, and that the country continues to reap the economic benefits from the skills that a balanced migration program brings.” The report called for an overhaul of the 457 visa program for temporary workers, saying the current system leaves migrants open to exploitation. It said it was no longer “inappropriate” to allow employers to say which occupations are in shortage, because that left a mismatch in supply and demand. It recommended the ministerial advisory council on skilled migration be overhauled so its membership included equal representation from business and unions, and independent experts. It said the council should also adopt an “evidence-based approach” to gathering information on which occupations should form part of the “occupational shortage list”, relying on input from stakeholders – through a formal and transparent submissions process – and on economic data. It said the council’s deliberations and recommendations should then be made publicly available. It also recommended that Australia’s working holiday visa program be capped, and that penalties for exploiting migrant workers be increased. It supported a recent Productivity Commission recommendation to shift to a “universal points test” for permanent skilled migrants, and to tighten entry requirements relating to age, skills and English-language proficiency. It said policymakers should also explore options to encourage settlement in regional areas, in particular Northern Australia, given the focus on driving investment and growth in that region. The 17 recommendations include: Consider the impact of the current migration program on Melbourne and Sydney and subsequent future infrastructure and services requirements. Provide a more robust model for determining occupation shortages with respect of 457 visas. Shift to a universal points test for permanent skilled migrants and tighten entry requirements relating to age, skills and English-language proficiency. Review and cap the working holiday visa program and possibly introduce a purpose-built guest worker program for specific industries struggling to attract adequate low-skilled workers. Increase penalties for exploiting migrant workers. Improve settlement services and support, access to English language pro-grams and recognition of foreign qualifications. Martin said with the right policies, Australia’s annual permanent migration intake could be increased significantly."
2016-10-24T10:12:57Z,Q&A: what happens now to the Calais refugees?,"Where are they going? Sixty buses will move the refugees and migrants to 164 reception centres across France. The accommodation centres, which are intended to be temporary, will each hold 40 to 50 people for up to four months while their asylum cases are examined. Those who do not claim asylum will be sent back to their country of origin. Almost two-thirds of those surveyed in the camp have said they do not want to be evicted and taken to French accommodation, while one-third say they will continue to try to get to the UK, according to the Refugee Rights Data Project. How many people live at the camp? The authorities say 7,000 people live here but charities put the number closer to 10,000. The French president, François Hollande, appeared to acknowledge that the official figure was an underestimate when he said last month that as many as 9,000 people could be moved from the camp to the reception centres. How will the camp be demolished? It is understood that 40 people will arrive on Tuesday to begin dismantling the camp. An additional 3,000 police are expected in and around Calais this week to assist with the process of clearing the camp and to attempt to ensure that migrants who do not want to claim asylum do not flee and/or set up new, smaller camps. With the eyes of the world on Calais, police are expected to try a soft approach, at least to begin with. There are fears that anarchists will stoke the atmosphere if French police are deemed to be heavy-handed. Why is this happening? France’s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, says the intention is to “unblock Calais”, which is said to have suffered serious economic security consequences as a result of the camp and the daily attempts by migrants to smuggle themselves on to lorries bound for Britain, sometimes leading to violent attacks on drivers. Politics has played a big part with the French right and far right increasing their calls for hardline action before next year’s presidential election. Alain Juppé, the current favourite to become the next president, has said France must push back its border with Britain from Calais to the Kent coast. The French government has also been under pressure to act to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the camp, where there is overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, food shortages as well as trafficking and exploitation of women and children. Hollande has said that conditions are not acceptable, especially for people fleeing war. What will happen to unaccompanied children? There is supposed to be a separate queue for the estimated 1,300 unaccompanied children in the camp at the warehouse that will act as a processing centre. About 500 are believed to be eligible to come to Britain under the amendment, brought about by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, himself a former child refugee. But campaigners fear that vulnerable minors could be lost in the chaos of the evacuation. Charity workers have expressed concern that children could be caught up in violence or left vulnerable to people traffickers. Have the French previously tried to clear the camp? In February and March, the authorities demolished a large area of the southern part of the camp, saying the aim was to radically reduce numbers of migrants. Police fired teargas at migrants who threw stones and set fire to shelters after dozens of makeshift shacks were dismantled. Despite the move, the number of people in the camp subsequently reached an all-time high of almost 10,000 people, exacerbating the overcrowding problem as an increased number of inhabitants were squeezed into an area of land less than half the size it previously was."
2016-12-13T00:01:41Z,"Migrant workers in Qatar still at risk despite reforms, warns Amnesty","Workers building 2022 World Cup stadiums in Qatar will remain at risk of forced labour because of “meagre reforms” that “barely scratch the surface” of the Gulf state’s exploitation of migrant labour, Amnesty International UK has warned. A law change that comes into effect on Tuesday, which Qatar says guarantees greater flexibility, freedom and protection for workers, will not “significantly change the exploitative relationship between employers and workers”, said the rights group. The Gulf state is spending an estimated $200bn on new transport infrastructure, housing and sports facilities, including six stadiums designed by architects including Lord Foster and the late Zaha Hadid. Construction for the 2022 World Cup will peak in the coming two years, and Spanish champions FC Barcelona are due to play an exhibition match in Doha on Tuesday. But Qatar’s kafala system, which is used to recruit the majority of its workforce from countries including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, has prompted international outcry because it prevents workers from changing jobs or leaving the country without a permit. It is alleged to have resulted in modern-day slavery for some workers. Qatar said on Monday it was abolishing kafala and that it was “enormously grateful to the millions of workers who have come to Qatar to build our nation’s infrastructure during this period of rapid change”. But James Lynch, deputy director for global issues at Amnesty, said the new law “may get rid of the word ‘sponsorship’ but it leaves the same basic system intact”. “It is good that Qatar has accepted that its laws were fuelling abuse but these inadequate changes will continue to leave workers at the mercy of exploitative bosses,” he said. Amnesty has warned Fifa that it “cannot continue to remain shamefully ambivalent to the plight of workers in Qatar” and said FC Barcelona “should make clear to their hosts their desire to play in a human rights-friendly environment. Players and clubs cannot live in a bubble”. Lynch, a former British diplomat in Doha, said that in practice employers would still be able to stop migrant workers from leaving the country and that, by making it easier for employers to confiscate workers’ passports, the new law could make the situation worse. “The tragedy is that many workers think that this new law will be the end of their ordeal,” he said. In a statement, the government of Qatar said it “fundamentally rejects Amnesty International’s claims”. Issa bin Saad al-Jafali al-Nuaimi, a minister of labour, said Qatar was replacing “the kafala system with a modernised contract-based system that safeguards worker rights and increases job flexibility”. The ministry of administrative development, labour and social affairs said migrant workers would be free to leave the country if their employer allowed them and could appeal to a committee if their request was rejected. Workers who have completed fixed-term contracts would be free to move jobs, while those on rolling contracts would be free to move if they have completed five years of service. Employers who confiscate passports will be fined up to QAR25,000 (£5,400). However, Amnesty says the new law also makes holding passports legal if a worker requests it in writing and argues that this could be abused because “employers in Qatar enjoy a disproportionate level of influence and control over their employees”. “For a migrant worker, the prospect of being tied to one employer for up to five years, unable to change employer to secure better conditions or escape poor treatment or abuse, is not greatly different from their current position and will not significantly reduce the risk of coercion of workers by their employers,” said Lynch. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is due to make a judgment in March on whether the forced labour of migrant workers in Qatar’s construction industry warrants further investigation. Amnesty is now calling on the Qatari authorities to abolish the exit permit system, prohibit all passport confiscation and ensure that workers can change jobs without requiring the permission of their employer. Al-Nuaimi said: “We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action.”"

The number of people crammed into the so-called Jungle refugee camp in Calais has now swelled to almost 10,000. People are outraged by shocking scenes of refugees and migrants from the camp desperately trying to get on to lorries bound for Britain. But this year, the darker underbelly of the Calais camp has begun to surface – that of people traffickers and their trade of modern slavery, a “barbaric evil” that the prime minister Theresa May has rightly pledged to lead the way in defeating. Last week footage emerged of a lorry stopped by a tree thrown across the approach road to the Calais docks. The camera then turned to a trafficker urging a man to clamber on board the stationary truck. Hardworking lorry drivers have had their journeys to the Port of Calais disrupted by these evil people traffickers for too long. The lengths they will go to stop lorries so migrants can get on board have become ever more extreme – as well as cutting down trees to block the route, they set fire to trucks, lob petrol bombs and threaten drivers with chainsaws and machetes. The current situation is shameful. Last week I met truckers in Calais who face these attacks daily. For years the French and British governments have tried in vain to tackle the ever-growing problem of the Calais camps. They have built fences to keep refugees and migrants away from the docks, but the attacks on trucks now just happen further down the road. They have built containers for people to stay in – yet thousands more continue to arrive. But these attempts at ending the chaos have only worsened the symptoms. It is now time to tackle the causes of this crisis and build a better future for both Calais and Dover. Dismantling the camp will remove this magnet for refugees and migrants, conned into heading for Calais by traffickers. These ruthless gangs steal the life-savings of vulnerable people and dump them in the squalor of the camp. Some are smuggled into Britain for a future in brothels or fruit fields, where they work to pay off huge debts to the traffickers. This is modern-day slavery, pure and simple. It is clear that we need far tougher action to tackle these traffickers. They must be caught and jailed – put behind bars for at least 20 years and have all their assets seized. We urgently require a new Dover patrol to guard the Channel and catch people traffickers on the high seas. We must also do more to protect our truckers and the vital trade they carry between Britain and France. Some French politicians have talked about scrapping the Le Touquet treaty, which establishes British border checks at Calais. But the French know just as well as we do that maintaining this system is as much in their interest as ours. Axing the treaty altogether would be a disaster for France and Britain. It would simply force the ferries and tunnel to take the place of border guards, meaning higher ticket prices and longer queues. And enabling people to apply for UK asylum from France would be a big mistake too. It would just make Calais an even greater magnet for refugees and migrants. Yesterday’s joint statement from the home secretary Amber Rudd and her French counterpart, Bernard Cazeneuve, is a welcome step in the right direction, with a greater focus on cracking down on people-traffickers and repatriating migrants. Yet the swelling of numbers at the Calais camp, refugee and migrant landings on British beaches and nightly attacks on lorries underline the need for further action. I would like to see the home secretary join me in Dover and Calais to see the current situation first hand, and discuss what more can be done. Britain is leaving the European Union, yet Brexit must not create discord. Instead it must be the start of a stronger relationship between Britain and France. This is the perfect moment to work together to deal with the causes of this crisis once and for all. Let’s restore order at the border by dismantling the Calais camp and smashing the modern-day slavery peddled by people traffickers."

2016-05-20T15:48:31Z,Syrian refugee wins appeal against forced return to Turkey,"The EU-Turkey migration deal has been thrown further into chaos after an independent authority examining appeals claims in Greece ruled against sending a Syrian refugee back to Turkey, potentially creating a precedent for thousands of other similar cases. In a landmark case, the appeals committee upheld the appeal of an asylum seeker who had been one of the first Syrians listed for deportation under the terms of the EU-Turkey deal. In a document seen by the Guardian, a three-person appeals tribunal in Lesbos said Turkey would not give Syrian refugees the rights they were owed under international treaties and therefore overturned the applicant’s deportation order by a verdict of two to one. The case will now be re-assessed from scratch. The committee’s conclusion stated: “The committee has judged that the temporary protection which could be offered by Turkey to the applicant, as a Syrian citizen, does not offer him rights equivalent to those required by the Geneva convention.” The decision undermines the legal and practical basis for the EU-Turkey deal, which European leaders had hoped would deter refugees from sailing to Europe by ensuring the swift deportation of most people landing on the Greek islands. After signing the deal on 18 March, EU officials claimed these deportations would be legally justified on the basis that Turkey respects refugee rights. But the EU’s executive has little control over Greek asylum protocols. The committee rejected the logic of the EU-Turkey deal, citing some of the EU’s own previous directives as explanations for their decision. While nearly 400 other asylum seekers have been returned to Turkey under the terms of the deal, no one of Syrian nationality had been sent back against their will – making Friday’s decision a watershed moment. “At its very first test, the EU-Turkey deal crumbles,” said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s deputy Europe director. The Greek government, which played no part in the independent decision, admitted the judgment had created “a very difficult situation”. Greece’s deputy minister in charge of migration policy, Yannis Mouzalas, said by phone from Brussels: “I have only just learned of the decision by the appeals committee and I have to be in Greece to study it. They are, as you know, independent committees so it is very difficult for me to say anything – but if they think this way, we will have a very difficult situation.” Such a decision goes against all the directives of the UN and UNHCR, Mouzalas claimed. “Really I don’t know how they arrived at it.” UNHCR offered no immediate response, but has previously criticised the EU-Turkey deal, and resolved to play no part in it. Greek media said it would be only a matter of time before the “bombshell” decision had the snowball effect of triggering an avalanche of similar asylum requests by other refugees, especially Syrians, detained on far-flung Aegean islands. Some 174 claims have been examined by appeals committees made up of asylum experts, lawyers and officials in Lesbos so far, with 100 being upheld, according to the Greek daily Kathimerini. Government figures released on Friday showed 8,592 migrants and refugees were currently being held on the islands, often in squalid conditions. The increased prospect of being allowed to stay in Greece, rather than being returned to Syria, could also spark a renewed wave of migration from Turkey. Deterred by the deal and by increased Turkish border protection, migrant numbers have dwindled significantly since the deal was announced. Human rights groups were quick to welcome the news. “We’ve always said Turkey is not a safe country for refugees because it has not fully signed up to the Geneva convention and to the social and judicial status of refugees, especially those who are not Syrians,” said Wenzel Michalski, who as Germany director of Human Rights Watch watched the first forced returns of migrants from Lesbos to Turkey in April. Pledges by Turkey to improve labour market regulations by facilitating work permits for refugees had not been delivered, nor had promises to install refugee children in the education system, he said. Even worse was evidence of push-backs at the Turkish-Syrian border where would-be refugees had been deliberately shot at and killed – claims denied by the Turkish government. “There are still lots of children who work instead of going to school and even worse, we still don’t really know about the fate of those deported so far, as NGOs and journalists have been denied access to refugee camps and the first thing Turkish authorities did was to confiscate their smartphones,” he said from Berlin. “We have to say: ‘Greece, thank you,’ because this is a wonderful move.”"
2016-12-16T11:07:18Z,"Guardian and Observer readers raise over £500,000 for child refugees","Guardian and Observer readers have raised more than £500,000 in less than a week for charities supporting child refugees. The 2016 appeal is raising money for three charities working with young refugees and migrants based mainly in continental Europe and the UK: Help Refugees, Safe Passage and the Children’s Society. The charities praised the generosity of readers and said the contributions would make a huge difference to the lives of young people driven from their homes by war and persecution in Syria and elsewhere. Although the charities predominantly provide aid, care and advocacy in Europe, Help Refugees has contributed funds to Syria-based aid projects, including £20,000 towards the cost of a mobile children’s hospital to be based near Aleppo, and a grant to buy two ambulances for the White Helmets aid group. Matthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “We’ve been overwhelmed by the wonderful generosity of Guardian and Observer readers. The shocking stories and pictures that we’re seeing from Syria right now are daily reminders of the horrific experiences that many of the children and young people seeking safety in the UK have gone through. “Now, more than ever, we need your support to help us make sure that they get the help, protection and warm welcome they desperately need once they get here, and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who has donated so far.” Neil Jameson, the executive director of Citizens UK, the parent charity of Safe Passage, said: “We have been overwhelmed by the Guardian and Observer readers’ response to this year’s appeal. The atrocities we have seen in Aleppo this week serve as a stark reminder of why people are fleeing; that they should have to risk their lives trying to reach sanctuary is an unnecessary cruelty. “Readers’ generous donations will help us continue to fight for safe routes and a warm reception for refugees in the UK.” Josie Naughton, a co-founder of Help Refugees, said: “We are delighted to hear this news and could not be more grateful to everyone who has donated. Thank you for being part of the movement, choosing love over hate. We would also like to thank the Guardian for its incredible support and for this opportunity. Together we will improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable people affected by the refugee crisis this winter.” It is the second successive year that the Guardian and Observer have chosen refugee charities for their annual appeal. Launching this year’s campaign, the Guardian and Observer editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, described the plight of refugees as “the great humanitarian crisis of our times”. On Saturday, Guardian and Observer journalists will hold the annual charity telethon to boost funds for the appeal. Viner, Polly Toynbee, Owen Jones, Marina Hyde, Gary Younge and John Mulholland, the Observer editor, will be among those on hand to take telephone donations from readers. The Guardian and Observer 2016 charity appeal runs until the new year. • Support child refugees by donating here"
2016-10-10T16:45:53Z,Migrants plan day of action to highlight contribution to Britain,"Migrant workers and their supporters are planning a day of action to highlight their role in the UK in what is being billed as a celebration of the contribution they make to British society.Plans for the event, called One Day Without Us, include a labour boycott to show how important migrants are to the UK workforce. Organiser Matt Carr, a writer and commentator, has urged migrants and their supporters to join in the day of action on 20 February 2017. He said the trigger for the event was profound concern about worsening attitudes to migrants in the UK. Carr said he believed that those who voted against Brexit, and also many of those who voted in favour of it, were alarmed at the levels of racism and xenophobia that had manifested before and after the referendum vote. “We want to make this an inclusive event,’’ Carr said. “We realise that because of the legal constraints on striking, many workers will not be able to take formal strike action. However, they can choose to support this event simply by taking the day off work.” He said he was surprised how quickly the event had gathered momentum. Despite discussions taking place in a closed Facebook group over a few days, Carr said there were now about 6,000 people involved in the conversation about A Day Without Us. The aim of the day of action is to emphasise the variety of work migrants undertake to help keep the UK afloat – from NHS doctors to those who staff the hospitality sector. The organisers say a day without migrant labour will demonstrate how much the economy would struggle without their contribution. The day of action, scheduled to coincide with the UN’s World Day of Social Justice, is based on similar events in the US in 2006 and in Italy in 2010. Carr plans to approach religious and community organisations as well as political parties and trade unions to support the idea and to ensure it takes place across the country and is rooted in local communities. Carr said he was hopeful that employers who relied on migrant labour would support the strike and shut their businesses for the day. “Since Brexit we have seen levels of xenophobia and racism that have been increasingly legitimised. We want to make a bold and powerful statement and give migrants an opportunity to express themselves,” he said."
2017-12-01T19:03:31Z,"The Guardian view on refugees and migrants: solidarity, not fear | Editorial","The scale of the global humanitarian crisis that has been unfolding since the Arab spring precipitated revolt and instability across the Middle East in 2011 can feel overwhelming. In the past few weeks alone, terrible stories have emerged of the brutal treatment of Rohingya Muslims, forced to flee Myanmar to grim camps in neighbouring Bangladesh. A fortnight ago, CNN ran a devastating film shot undercover in Libya, showing young migrants from Nigeria being auctioned into slavery. The sight and sound of a market in human beings carries a weight that dwarfs other reporters’ graphic accounts of the scale of the trade. The impact of the CNN report drew unflattering attention to the EU-backed programme run by Libya to detain and repatriate migrants in order to prevent them attempting the Mediterranean crossing into Italy or Spain. This is an arrangement of convenience for Europe. It has led to migrants being held in wretched and degrading conditions that in an unusual rebuke of the countries that pay a significant part of the costs, were condemned by the UN as “inhuman”. This week the EU met with members of the African Union in Addis Ababa. The EU has now signed up to a programme to repatriate migrants rather than leaving the huge task to a country that is still in turmoil after the fall of Gaddafi, which was backed by the UK, France and the US. The great majority of the world’s displaced people flee to the nearest safe place, often another poor or middle-income country: in the past year a million refugees have arrived in Uganda from South Sudan. By far the largest part of the responsibility for those displaced around the Middle East has been borne by neighbouring countries, in particular Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Europe has been reluctant and defensive in responding to a crisis for which it is at least partly to blame. There has been a complete failure to agree a fair process for resettlement of refugees across the 28 member states. Greece and Italy have been left, for years now, to manage an unprecedented influx of desperate men, women and children. In an unparalleled international political vacuum, there has been little global leadership. Last year, the New York declaration on refugees and migrants tried to lay the framework for a positive approach. It starts with recognising realities: the forces that motivate young people to risk death in the hope of a better life need to be met not by the kind of resistance that ends up with thousands being penned up in a filthy Libyan detention centre, but by opening up legal channels of migration. Migrants want to work, and they want to be able to send cash home. Remittances are worth many billions of dollars to the economies of the global south; they cannot replace development aid, but they far outstrip its value. This time next year a UN refugee summit in Morocco aims to have a programme for legal migration in place. A humane policy for migrants would make it easier to distinguish and meet our obligations to refugees, those who flee in fear. The responsibility for displaced people has fallen on poorer countries in a grossly disproportionate way. At the very least, there should be a programme of education so that every child in every camp has a school place. Internally displaced people need to be helped to find work (not always easy) and supported with direct cash payments that will go back into the local economy. But all of this depends on changing attitudes, above all moving away from the language of threat. Many people in the rich world want to – and do – support refugees, often in a more personal way than giving money: Canada’s scheme, for example, of finding sponsors for 15,000 Syrian refugees was hugely oversubscribed. Fear often speaks with a powerful voice. But so can that other great human emotion, solidarity. The former foreign secretary David Miliband has called this crisis a test of humanity. It is one that we must not fail."
2017-12-12T00:01:18Z,"EU leaders complicit in torture of refugees and migrants, Amnesty says","European leaders stand accused by Amnesty International of being knowingly complicit in the torture and exploitation of thousands of migrants and refugees by the EU-financed Libyan coastguard and officials running the country’s detention camps. In an attempt to stem the flow of people across the Mediterranean to Europe, the EU is financing a system that routinely acts in collusion with militia groups and people traffickers to “make money from human suffering”, a report from the human rights group claims. Following the provision of ships, training and funding from the EU and Italy to the Libyan coastguard, the number of arrivals to Italy fell by 67% between July and November compared with the same period in 2016. Deaths at sea have been reduced commensurately. Yet Amnesty claims the coastguard and those to whom they hand over refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, are often acting in cahoots with criminal gangs and militia. Agreements between the coastguard and smugglers are signalled by markings on boats that allow specific vessels to pass through Libyan waters without interception, it is claimed. The coastguard has also been known to escort boats out to international waters. Those are who are intercepted on their way to Europe are sent to camps run by the Libyan general directorate for combating illegal migration (DCIM), where torture for the purposes of extracting money is almost routine, Amnesty reports. One man from Gambia, who was detained for three months, told Amnesty how he was starved and beaten in a detention centre. “They beat me with a rubber hose because they want money to release me,” he said. “They call the family while beating [you] so the family send money.” After interviews with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants and meetings with Libyan officials and others with knowledge of the abuses, Amnesty claims it now has sufficient evidence to take leaders of EU states to international courts over alleged abuses of human right obligations. “You will see us in court,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty’s Europe director. “Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in Libya are at the mercy of the Libyan authorities, militias, armed groups and smugglers often working seamlessly together for financial gain. Tens of thousands are kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centres where they are subjected to systematic abuse. “European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these crimes.” Up to 20,000 people are currently held in what the Amnesty report, Libya’s Dark Web of Collusion, says are overcrowded, unsanitary centres, often under the control of militia and criminals. “For some time there has been concern that the price for stemming migration has been the human rights of those seeking to come to the EU,” the report says. Last month the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the abuse of migrants as “a crime against humanity” and said the EU and the African Union would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks”. In March, a review by the UK Independent Commission for Aid Impact said the UK role in the capacity-building programme with the Libyan coastguard was “deliver[ing] migrants back to a system that leads to indiscriminate and indefinite detention and denies refugees their right to asylum”. The UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, has described the suffering of migrants in Libyan camps as an “outrage to the conscience of humanity”. It is claimed by Amnesty that the EU member states “cannot plausibly claim to be unaware of the grave violations being committed by some of the detention officials and coastguard agents with whom they are so assiduously cooperating”. Brussels stands accused of failing to install the necessary rights protection mechanisms and guarantees from its Libyan counterparts. The reports says: “The lack of any judicial oversight of the detention process and the near total impunity with which officials operate has facilitated the institutionalisation of torture and other ill-treatment in detention centres.” Last month Mohamed Alkoni, the Libyan charge d’affaires, said any proven allegationof slavery was “an act of an individual, and not a systematic practice”."
2017-12-04T18:49:12Z,Pope shines as Trump fails test of leadership on migrants and refugees | Letter,"Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the UN global compacts on migration and refugees (Report, 4 December) is the latest example of the president’s abdication of leadership on a defining issue of our time. It is to be hoped that other leaders respond by redoubling efforts, as they did when Mr Trump announced the US’s abandonment of the Paris agreement. The international community should look to another head of state, Pope Francis, for an example of true leadership. He has made clear that the unprecedented movement of people worldwide constitutes a global phenomenon. As such, it requires a global response, not the renunciation of responsibility. This message will be echoed in the Holy See’s contribution to discussions taking place this week in Mexico. The pope has called our response to the plight faced by displaced people “a test of our humanity”. It is a test other leaders must not fail.

2017-08-11T15:22:42Z,Refugee rescue ship sails to aid of anti-migrant activists stranded in Med,"An NGO vessel that has saved the lives of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean is sailing to the rescue of a group of far-right anti-immigration activists whose ship is in difficulties off the coast of Libya. The German NGO Sea Eye said one of its search and rescue boats was on its way to the C-Star, manned by members of the extremist Generation Identity group, which sent a distress signal after an engine failure left it unable to manoeuvre. Michael Busch Heuer, the founder of the Regensburg-based aid organisation, which operates two rescue vessels active in the Mediterranean since early 2016, said it was the duty of anyone at sea “to help those in distress, irrespective of their origin, colour, religion or beliefs”. Sea Eye said in a statement on its Facebook page that it had been informed on Friday morning by Operation Sophia, the joint EU naval operation deterring migrant smugglers and human traffickers in the Mediterranean, that the 40-metre (130ft) C-Star was in difficulty. “Since our vessel the Sea Eye is closest to the C-Star, we were instructed by the maritime rescue coordination centre in Rome, the emergency service for the western Mediterranean, to go to its aid,” the NGO said. Generation Identity’s self-styled “Defend Europe” mission played down the incident, calling it a “minor technical problem” that meant the vessel was “not under command”. Defend Europe chartered the C-Star in Djibouti last month after raising €75,000 (£67,000) through crowdfunding. After originally promising to actively block migrant boats, it now says it is “monitoring” rescues in the Mediterranean. The group – part of a five-year-old movement of young, far-right activists from France, Germany, Austria, Italy and the UK who are opposed to Islam and immigration – accuses NGOs that have rescued about one third of the nearly 100,000 people saved in the Mediterranean this year of illegally working with people smugglers to bring migrants to Europe. Katie Hopkins, the MailOnline columnist, met members of the group in Catania, Sicily, tweeting: “Good to meet Team C-Star @DefendEuropeID. Young people, eight nations, crowdfunded, shining a light on NGO people traffickers in Med.” But the Defend Europe venture has not been an unmitigated success. First, the C-Star was held up for a week in the Suez canal by Egyptian authorities looking for weapons. Then some of its Sri Lankan crew jumped ship when it docked in the Cypriot port of Famagusta last month; several reportedly asked for asylum. The ship’s crew and owner, Sven Tomas Egerstrom, were accused in court of preparing and circulating false documents but later released. After leaving Cyprus on 1 August and being advised not to dock in Greece or Sicily for fear of protests, the vessel, which flies the Mongolian flag, was prevented by Tunisian fishermen from putting into the port of Zarzis for supplies. “If they come here, we’ll block the refuelling channel,” said Chamseddine Bourassine, a local fishermen’s leader. “It is the least we can do given what is happening out in the Mediterranean. Muslims and Africans are dying.” The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, a local NGO, said it would oppose any attempt by the C-Star to dock and take on fresh supplies of fuel, food and water in a Tunisian port. It called on the government “not to cooperate with its racist and dangerous crew”."
2017-12-14T13:00:44Z,Stranded migrants rescued from rocks off Turkey in dramatic operation,"The Turkish coastguard has mounted a dramatic rescue operation in the Aegean Sea, saving 51 people who became stranded on rocks as they attempted to cross to Greece. Authorities intervened after receiving an emergency call at 1.12am local time. The coastguard said the rescue operation could only begin in daylight due to the rocky area and bad sea conditions. Helicopters dropped food and blankets in the night. Footage from the rescue operation near the coastal city of İzmir showed coastguard personnel airlifting a child as others waited on the rocks next to a partially deflated rubber dinghy. Five children and a woman were rescued in this way while the rest were transferred to coastguard boats with the assistance of fishermen in the area, the coastguard said. There was no information on the migrants’ nationalities, but Turkey is home to 3 million refugees from Syria, and many have continued to attempt the risky boat ride across the sea to Greece despite a deal between Ankara and the European Union that has curtailed illegal crossings. While some still attempt the sea route, others try to cross into Greece through the land border, and are sometimes forcibly returned even after entering the Greek mainland. In addition to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, economic migrants from Asia and north Africa also attempt the crossing. More than 800,000 people reached Greece from Turkey at the height of the crisis in 2015, most of them settling in Germany and Sweden. The March 2016 EU deal, under which Turkey cracked down on illegal migration in exchange for an assistance package and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens, has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups, who say Europe has shirked its responsibility to process asylum requests. Since the deal, Turkey says the number of people detained while making the illegal crossing has fallen by 85%. Thousands of refugees and migrants are stranded in camps in Greece as the country attempts to deal with a backlog of asylum requests, and the influx has empowered far right and anti-immigrant parties across Europe. A relocation scheme introduced by the EU in 2015 in an attempt to share the burden of migrant arrivals has been vilified by nationalist governments. Earlier this week the Guardian reported how Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, was ready to abandon the policy, which is being discussed by EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. On the ground, the suffering continues. A report by 12 humanitarian organisations released on Wednesday said 2,000 unaccompanied children were stranded on waiting lists for safe shelters in Greece, amid a chronic shortage of housing, with many sleeping rough. While interest has waned in the refugee crisis, humanitarian organisations and governments on the Mediterranean continue to mount rescue missions for stranded people, many of whom now attempt to cross through Libya. A recent CNN investigation in the country documented the horrific and widespread abuse of migrants and refugees, describing how some are sold as slaves in local markets after their capture. Human rights organisations have blamed the European Union, which is providing funds to curtail migration from Libya, for being complicit in the abuses."
2017-05-05T17:57:22Z,Giving migrants and refugees in London a place to stay | Letters,"It was heartbreaking and profoundly depressing to read about Paradzai Nkomo’s terrible experience (Living in limbo, G2, 4 May). What a shocking waste of talent, and a total disregard for women’s potential and what they can offer, wherever they come from. My family, dating right back to my grandmother and the East and West Friendship Council, have always welcomed visitors, students and refugees into our homes and we continue to do so through the Housing Justice’s London hosting network. Our current guest came to live in our spare room in October. He has been in the UK for 15 years, and is equally trapped in the idiocies of the system. He had been living on the night buses for three months, having been homeless for a year. He is one of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met, and has nothing but good to say about all those who he encountered in his enforced wanderings. He also had a plastic bag, and was on crutches. He is now in hospital, having become terribly ill as a result. I want Paradzai to know that there are many of us, and that we welcome her, and if we can help her in any way, we will. Above all, don’t despair.

2017-12-03T15:03:30Z,Donald Trump pulls US out of UN global compact on migration,"The Trump administration has pulled out of the United Nations’ ambitious plans to create a more humane global strategy on migration, saying involvement in the process interferes with American sovereignty, and runs counter to US immigration policies. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, informed the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, at the weekend that Donald Trump was not willing to continue with an American commitment to the UN global compact on migration. The announcement of the US withdrawal from the pact came hours before the opening of a UN global conference on migration scheduled to begin on Monday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. In 2016, the 193 members of the UN general assembly unanimously adopted a non-binding political declaration, the New York declaration for refugees and migrants, pledging to uphold the rights of refugees, help them resettle and ensure they had access to education and jobs. The initiative had the enthusiastic backing of Barack Obama, and was embraced by Guterres as one of his major challenges for 2018. The aim is to publish a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration next year in time for adoption by the UN general assembly in September. Louise Arbour, appointed as the UN’s special representative to oversee the process, regards the global compact as a chance to shift world opinion on the need to address future migration, in the same way that the UN had managed to persuade the world it needed to address climate change. There are currently 60 million people who have been displaced worldwide. The US decision to withdraw will delight Trump’s “America first” political base, but will do little to improve his standing in developing countries. The US mission to the UN said in a statement on Saturday that the declaration “contains numerous provisions that are inconsistent with US immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles”. The UN had always insisted that the compact was never intended to be legally binding on any country, but instead was an attempt to create a shared understanding that migration flows are likely to increase, and need to be regularised by recognising the reality of state interdependence, as much as national sovereignty. In a statement issued on Saturday, Haley said: “America is proud of our immigrant heritage and our longstanding moral leadership in providing support to migrant and refugee populations across the globe … But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.” She said: “We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York declaration is simply not compatible with US sovereignty.” The move, which is likely to put US-UN relations back in the deep freeze, came following pressure largely from the White House, as opposed to Haley herself. The US has already pulled out of the UN climate change treaty and Unesco, the cultural heritage body, accusing the latter’s leadership of an anti-Israeli bias. The impact of the migration pullout is more symbolic than practical, since the UN never had any illusion that it could control a member state’s policies."
2017-11-09T06:00:06Z,Anger rises in Lesbos over crowded refugee camps,"A surge in refugee arrivals has led to soaring tensions on Greece’s outlying Aegean islands, with Lesbos’s mayor accusing the government in Athens of allowing it to become a giant prison camp. Boycotting celebrations on Wednesday marking the 105th anniversary of Lesbos’s liberation from Ottoman Turkish rule, local officials gave the leftist-led coalition in Athens an ultimatum: either it took immediate action to decongest the island or risked mass protests from an increasingly unruly population. “We are utterly opposed to policies that are turning Lesbos and other border areas into concentration camps where all human dignity is denied,” said Spyros Galinos, the island’s mayor. “The government has failed to keep to its commitment to effectively deal with this problem and move people on.” The explosive mood matches the rising number of asylum seekers on Lesbos, the gateway for the vast majority of refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the crisis in 2015. Close to 6,000 people are being held at the island’s main camp in Moria, which was initially established as a temporary measure to house no more than 2,000. After a fourfold daily increase in arrivals nationwide over the past three months, the Greek immigration minister Ioannis Mouzalas said the government was considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. “The rise is concerning,” he told a recent news conference in Athens. Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey to stem the influx in March 2016, refugees reaching Greek islands are forbidden from travelling to the mainland pending completion of asylum requests. As a result nearly 15,000 men, women and children are stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the Aegean islands closest to Turkey’s shores, according to figures released by Greece’s interior ministry. In Lesbos and Samos more than 8,300 asylum seekers and migrants are living in facilities meant for just 3,000. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that refugee and migrant numbers jumped from 3,665 in August to 4,604 in September. “After the fall of Mosul there has been a discernible increase … and 98% of those who come request asylum,” explained Daniel Esdras, the IOM’s Greece office director. “Any change in a conflict zone will automatically have a huge impact on migratory flows.” The containment policy has been denounced by human rights groups. In a letter last month to the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, 18 organisations said the abysmal conditions in which people were being made to live – including the elderly, infirm and vulnerable – were placing lives at risk. Municipal authorities have reacted furiously to suggestions that camps be enlarged and new ones established, arguing that expansion in any form will only lure more refugees and migrants. At the height of the refugee crisis before countries along the Balkan corridor closed their frontiers and shut off entry to Europe, locals on Lesbos exhibited extraordinary compassion, rushing to greet refugees and offering aid. But the failure to effectively decongest the islands since the EU-Turkey deal was signed has prompted growing anger with residents blaming overcrowding for almost every ill, including the rise in crime. Alleviation was necessary not only to maintain the dignity of people fleeing poverty and war but to “protect social cohesion in a border area that is of national significance to Greece”, its town hall said. Officials in Athens have been reluctant to criticise Ankara for the increase in numbers, instead attributing the rise to a reflection of Turkey’s strained relations with the EU before a visit to Greece in early December by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “We are Turkey’s neighbour, we are not Luxembourg and so we are careful about what we say,” Ioannis Balafas, the deputy migration minister, told the Guardian. “What we are seeing is a political game. Whenever Turkey wants to put the pressure on Europe it turns on the tap and lets more [people] through.” Giorgos Koumoutsakos, the shadow minister of foreign affairs in the main opposition New Democracy party, agreed. “If it really wanted to, Turkey could more effectively control the flows,” he said. “What we are seeing, it would seem, is a reflection of Turkey’s problematic relationship with the EU.” In the meantime, Greece’s easternmost islands were paying the price."
2017-12-11T16:25:19Z,EU could 'scrap refugee quota scheme',"The EU could scrap a divisive scheme that compels member states to accept quotas of refugees, one of the bloc’s most senior leaders will say this week. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, will tell EU leaders at a summit on Thursday that mandatory quotas have been divisive and ineffective, in a clear sign that he is ready to abandon the policy that has created bitter splits across the continent. Tusk will set a six-month deadline for EU leaders to reach unanimous agreement on reforms to the European asylum system, but will propose alternatives if there is no consensus. “If there is no solution … including on the issue of mandatory quotas, the president of the European council will present a way forward,” states a draft letter from Tusk to national capitals, seen by the Guardian. In effect this means scrapping mandatory quotas, because Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic are fiercely opposed to the idea of dispersing refugees around the bloc based on a formula drawn up in Brussels. Tusk is likely to face opposition, however, from other EU bodies, including the European commission. EU leaders introduced compulsory quotas in 2015 at the height of the migration crisis, as thousands of people arrived daily on Europe’s shores, many of whom were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea. Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the move, but the policy was forced through by a majority vote. Hungary and Poland have defied the rest of the EU by not taking a single refugee under the scheme, which aimed to relocate about 120,000 refugees, mainly Syrians. The Czech republic has taken in only 12. All three countries were referred to the European court of justice last week for failing to implement the policy, the usual procedure for flouting EU rules. Despite the backlash against the emergency scheme, the European commission proposed making quotas a permanent feature of EU law in 2016. Under its proposal, countries that refuse to take part in a “corrective allocation mechanism” to take the pressure off member states bearing the brunt would have to pay a “solidarity contribution” of €250,000 (£220,000) per asylum seeker. The idea has been stalled for months, as home affairs ministers who make the law have been unable to agree on it. Any move to drop the plan is likely to upset Italy and Greece, countries that have urged the rest of the EU to help them cope with large numbers of refugees and migrants in recent years. Germany and Sweden, backed by the European commission, are also likely to contest any plan deemed to reduce the help offered by other member states. One EU diplomat said some member states were surprised by Tusk’s letter “because it doesn’t seem to be in sync” with work undertaken by home affairs ministers working on the file. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, thinks mandatory quotas have been a gift to hardliners, such as the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has seized on migration as part of his wider Stop Brussels campaign. Eurosceptics in Poland, such as the Law and Justice leader Jarosław Kaczyński, whose party won an election victory over Tusk’s centre-right group in October 2015, have also criticised the policy. Tusk’s scepticism about the prospect of consensus has been evident for months. He said in October that mandatory quotas had put members states in almost permanent conflict. Tusk will call on EU governments to take charge, rather than leaving Brussels to set the pace in managing refugee policy. “Only member states are able to tackle the migration crisis effectively,” Tusk’s letter says. “The EU’s role is to offer its full support in all possible ways to help member states handle the migration crisis. But the EU has neither the capacity nor legal possibilities to replace member states.” He will also urge EU leaders to spend more on schemes aimed at keeping refugees and would-be migrants outside Europe, such as €3bn for Syrian refugees in Turkey and the €1.9bn EU Africa trust fund. The EU will confront an earlier promise to give Turkey’s government a further €3bn to help Syrian refugees in early 2018, which could lead to a repeat of EU institutions asking governments to find more cash. The EU has improvised such schemes in response to crises, but Tusk wants more funds available from the new seven-year budget covering the period from 2021, which will come up for discussion next year. He is calling for “stable and long-term financing mechanisms, in place of the existing ad hoc pledging on a much larger scale”, but has stopped short of putting a price tag on future migration policy."
2017-11-01T22:28:40Z,Foster carers housing lone child refugees to receive specialist training,"The government has announced specialist training for 1,000 foster carers looking after unaccompanied migrant children, ahead of a key court ruling on a decision to wind up a scheme under which child refugees are brought to the UK. The announcement comes as ministers face criticism for the UK’s failure to accept any child refugees from Greece or Italy since the Dubs scheme to help settle lone child asylum seekers was created last year. Only 200 vulnerable children have been brought to the UK under the scheme; a further 280 places offered by councils around the UK are currently unfilled. A court case brought by the charity Help Refugees will rule on Thursday morning on the legality of a government decision not to continue with the Dubs scheme, designed to bring vulnerable refugee children in Europe to the UK. The charity launched a legal challenge in the summer on whether the government had failed to implement the Dubs amendment properly. Robert Goodwill, minister for children and families, said: “Child refugees are some of the most vulnerable in our country and it is vital that we support them as they build safer lives, often in the care of new families. Foster carers do an incredible job, but they must have tailored support to help them deal with the complex needs of these children.” The new training scheme for foster carers and support workers will get £200,000 in funding between 2017 and 2019, the government said. An additional £60,000 investment will provide a package of revised guidance, information and resources for councils. Immigration minister Brandon Lewis said: “Last year almost 3,000 unaccompanied children claimed asylum in the UK and they all require ongoing care and protection.” The government’s new safeguarding strategy on unaccompanied asylum seeking and refugee children received a qualified welcome from charities supporting refugee children. Ilona Pinter, from the Children’s Society, said it was a constructive move, but that she was worried that the “government has not committed to reviewing access to legal aid for unaccompanied children’s immigration applications to remain in the UK”. These issues, as well as post-Brexit arrangements for child refugees, will be debated in parliament later on Thursday. Around 200 migrant children hoping to travel to the UK are currently sleeping rough in Calais and nearby port towns. Roughly a third are believed to have family in the UK. The French government this week opened a temporary centre for unaccompanied child refugees in the town, a year after the informal camp that housed 10,000 migrants by the French port was demolished, according to the British charity Safe Passage, which campaigns for safe legal routes for refugees seeking protection. Run by the French children’s charity France Terre d’Asile, the centre will offer around 20 places and is expected to be temporary, according to Safe Passage’s French-based staff. No official announcement has been made about the centre’s opening, although it is understood to have allowed some children in on Monday. The centre is designed to accommodate young people hoping to be reunited with family in the UK and those deemed eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs scheme, the charity said. The decision to open the centre is a significant move, given the reluctance of French authorities to create any kind of centre that might attract more migrants to the port. It will mean that those young people housed there will no longer have to sleep in the bushes around the port. Since the camp’s demolition last year, local police have routinely removed tents and any semi-permanent structures from the woods on the town’s outskirts, leaving migrants to live in the open, with no access to sanitation, tents, showers or food. Alf Dubs, who arrived as a child in the UK as a kindertransport refugee and who persuaded the government to set up the scheme for unaccompanied child refugees (which was originally designed to help up to 3,000 children), said: “The development of a centre near Calais is welcome, but it must be permanent and provide legal support to children trying to access safe and legal routes to Britain. “We must put an end to desperate children jumping on lorries, risking their lives and others as they seek to reach their loved ones – as is their legal right.”"
2017-12-20T12:00:26Z,Coming to the aid of drowning migrants? Get ready to be treated like a criminal | Lorena Gazzotti,"Activists and NGOs defending migrants’ rights will remember 2017 as the year in which they were targeted by legal systems in Europe and north Africa. Take the case of Helena Maleno Garzón, a Spanish journalist and human rights advocate. You may not have heard of her. But authorities on both sides of the strait of Gibraltar know her well. Maleno, who has been living in Tangier since 2001, will on 27 December face a hearing as part of an investigation by Moroccan authorities into her alleged collusion with smuggling and human-trafficking networks. Central to the case are the calls that Maleno has been making to the Spanish and the Moroccan coastguards since 2007 about boats in distress in the strait and the Alboran Sea. Because of their proximity to migrant communities in northern Morocco, Maleno and other activists regularly receive distress calls, and they relay the signals to naval authorities, a vital step in ensuring migrants’ rescue. You may think what she does is simply humane, but the Moroccan investigation mirrors proceedings on the Spanish side of the strait, where police launched an investigation based on similar allegations a few years ago. It was dropped earlier this year due to lack of evidence of any criminal activity. One can see why governments are trying to discourage Maleno. Her work has made her an inconvenient witness to the deadly consequences of border surveillance policies. Unlawful deportations from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, migrants injured by border guards during attempts to jump the fences dividing Spanish and Moroccan territory, countless migrants perishing in the strait: these are just some facts documented by Maleno in a recent report for the collective Caminando Fronteras. These are events that demand authorities live up to their responsibilities – and address human rights violations and the humiliating living conditions endured each day by migrants at the border. This story is part of a disturbing pattern in which European states are attempting to criminalise activists operating in different parts of the Mediterranean. Consider the allegations of facilitating irregular migration directed by Italian authorities at NGOs conducting search and rescue in the central Mediterranean, or the French farmer Cédric Herrou, given a suspended jail sentence for assisting migrants arriving from Italy. The investigation in Italy into the NGO Jugend Rettet, an organisation of young Europeans who perform search and rescue missions, is continuing. What is happening here seems clear: in order to sustain current border policies, allegations of facilitating migration and collusion with smuggling networks have become the new weapon on both shores of the Mediterranean to discredit those who challenge restrictive migration policies. The presence of activists and solidarity networks at crossing points troubles those in charge of European migration policies for two reasons. First, there is the enduring myth of the “pull factor”, which says that providing assistance to distressed migrants increases their willingness to cross. Decreasing the pull factors, they say, will reduce the number of migrants making for the Mediterranean’s European coast – even though research has largely disproved this argument. Second, NGOs and activists are inconvenient witnesses to the brutal and inhumane consequences of migration policies. The work of activists like Maleno, patiently collecting testimony that contradicts official explanations, has led to judicial procedures being reopened. This includes the investigation into the deaths in 2014 of 15 migrants off Tarajal beach, in Ceuta, allegedly as a result of the actions of Spanish civil guards. The criminalisation of activists and solidarity networks reduces and discourage the ability of independent actors to monitor and criticise the conduct of state authorities, which is a principle of the democratic process. To appease the obsession for border control, these unfair attacks undermine that democratic scrutiny. But the damage goes further. Discouraging activists bolsters the view that some lives are worth less than others. And that the fact that migrants might perish during the crossing should be simply accepted as part of the game. Commenting on her own case, Maleno raised the concern that should worry everybody. “The most painful thing,” she said. “Is the normalisation of the loss of the right to life.” • Lorena Gazzotti is an academic specialising in migration and refugee studies"
2017-02-02T15:39:50Z,Coldplay throw support behind refugee and migrant charity,"Coldplay have thrown their support behind a charity which has saved the lives of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing war and persecution in the Middle East. The band, which has a long history of support for a range of charitable causes, has become a long-term patron of Moas (Migrant Offshore Aid Station), which operates professional search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin said: “Every year, Moas rescue thousands of people who risk death at sea while searching for a better life. But for an accident of geography, those people could be us and we could be them. For this reason, we’re proud to support Moas’ life-saving work”. Over the past two years Moas boats have rescued an estimated 33,000 refugees attempting perilous crossings to Europe in often overcrowded and unseaworthy rubber dinghies. The majority of refugees were from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Last year, at least 5,079 refugees and migrants drowned while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to the UN Migration Agency, although some charities believe this figure is likely to be an underestimate. Martin sings an a capella version of his song Don’t Panic on a short fundraising film released on Thursday that features footage of a recent rescue. Moas said the film “aims to give the viewer an immersive experience of a rescue and show the fear, hope and anguish experienced by the refugees and migrants”. The timing of the band’s announcement came amid increasing global political tension over refugees and border controls, including Donald Trump announcing controversial measures designed to prevent refugees from entering the US. Moas said that in light of recent political developments Coldplay believed it was more important than ever to support vulnerable people. Founder Regina Catrambone said: “We are very grateful to Coldplay for believing so strongly in our cause”. “Moas is a young organisation that in a few years has managed to make a significant difference in mitigating one of the most heart-breaking humanitarian tragedies of our era. However, there is still so much to be done. Coldplay’s support will allow our work to reach the hearts of a wider audience worldwide.” Moas was founded in 2014 by two Italian-American entrepreneurs, Chris and Regina Catrambone, after a humanitarian disaster in October 2013 when an estimated 400 people drowned off the island of Lampedusa. It was one of six refugee charities that benefited from the Guardian and Observer’s 2015 charity appeal, which raised £2.6m. Coldplay have supported a number of charities over the years, including Oxfam, the Red Cross, War Child, Amnesty International and Kids Company. Martin reportedly donates 10% of his annual income to charity."
2017-12-14T18:04:49Z,Bitter divisions over migration threaten show of unity at EU summit,"Divisions over migration marred a show of unity at an EU summit on Thursday, after Germany and Italy hit back at plans that could spell the end of mandatory refugee quotas. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have led criticism of a proposal from the European council president, Donald Tusk, who has described refugee quotas as “divisive and ineffective”. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, whose country has struggled to manage large numbers of refugees and migrants, criticised Tusk’s comments as “aimless, ill-timed and pointless”. Arriving at the EU summit in Brussels, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said there “cannot be selective solidarity” among EU member states”. Germany gave refuge to more than 1 million asylum seekers in 2015 and has been championing the policy of sharing refugees through quotas, when numbers could overwhelm other countries. “We need solidarity not just in regulating and steering migration,” Merkel said, “but we also need internal solidarity.” The row threatens to overshadow an EU summit insiders hoped would be a show of unity, with leaders launching landmark plans for greater military cooperation and basking in a common position on the first phase of Brexit talks. Only three countries – Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic – came out strongly in favour of Tusk’s plan ahead of the summit. The Czech Republic’s new prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said any attempt to impose “nonsensical” quotas in a majority vote would only widen the divisions in the EU. “It won’t happen.” Poland’s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he was happy that Poland’s opposition to allowing refugees into Europe seemed to be gaining acceptance. Poland, along with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, pledged €35m (£30m) for Italian-led projects to protect the border at Libya, as part of EU efforts to stem the flow of people attempting the dangerous journey to Europe. Speaking after the summit broke up, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he was happy with the contribution, but money was not enough. “This is what every country is doing. This cannot come in the place of, instead of being willing to take up your fair share in terms of the burden-sharing.” The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, welcomed the financial contribution but said the four countries still needed to accept refugees. “We will continue to insist that a commitment on the relocation of refugees is needed.” Officials have been even blunter in private: one European diplomat told his counterparts that Tusk’s paper should be put in the bin. Another diplomatic source said it was badly written and “much too unbalanced in favour” of central Europe. However, another EU diplomat, from a country supporting quotas, said it was “time to attack the issue”, which was “starting to poison” other debates. “At this point in time, what I am expecting is a good old bust up and in a later phase we will narrow the field of possible outcomes.” The EU is not aiming to reach conclusions on this thorny issue at the summit. “Divisions are accompanied by emotions which make it hard to find even a common language and rational arguments for this debate,” Tusk said, referring to the chasm of opinion on migration, but also the future of the single currency. EU leaders agreed on compulsory quotas at the height of the migration crisis in 2015, despite opposition from four central and eastern european countries. The bloc is discussing whether to make quotas a permanent feature of the EU’s asylum system, but the proposals have been making slow progress. The Tusk plan, reported by the Guardian earlier this week, took countries by surprise and is seen as out of step with months of work done by EU home affairs ministers. The European commission, backed by several member states, has also been infuriated by what it sees as a march on to its turf of proposing EU laws and policies. In his letter to leaders, Tusk said he would present “a way forward for consideration by leaders” after June 2018 if there was no consensus. “The European council [that Tusk leads] is not a legislative body,” said an EU diplomat. “I don’t think he can mean we should bypass our normal procedures.” The commission has also been irritated by Tusk’s claim that the 2015 quota system was a failure. “The commission firmly disagrees with the statement that relocation as an emergency response has been ‘ineffective’,” a spokeswoman said. “Over 32,000 people have been relocated – over 90% of all those eligible.” The commission said member states should be working towards a European approach. “Returning to a pre-crisis mode of isolated, uncoordinated, national action is not an option and would betray years’ worth of collective work to better the collective European response to managing migration.” The UK, which has an opt-out from this part of EU asylum policy, has been sitting on the sidelines of the debate and has never taken part in mandatory refugee relocation."
2017-07-31T18:12:37Z,France to provide water and open centres for refugees near Calais,"The French government has said it will provide water and sanitation to refugees and migrants in Calais and open two reception centres away from the port, hours after a court ordered it to end the inhuman treatment of migrants. France’s highest administrative court ruled that President Emmanuel Macron’s government and the Calais region must provide hundreds of refugees with drinking water, showers and toilets. The ruling came almost a year after the makeshift refugee camp in Calais, home to thousands of migrants trying to get to the UK, was bulldozed by French authorities. It was a setback for the local Calais authorities who had been taking a hard line with any new sign of settlements, discouraging charities from providing tents or food. Calais is still proving attractive to migrants searching a better life in the UK, although the numbers are significantly lower than last October and November when the camp was cleared. France’s interior minister, Gérard Collomb, said there were about 350-400 refugees and migrants around Calais compared with 10,000 at the peak last year. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past but we also want to handle the problems in Calais,” Collomb said, indicating a determination to avoid providing facilities that could draw migrants to the town, making it once more a hub for those trying to reach Britain. A local court said this year that the authorities must provide access to water, prompting an appeal by the interior ministry and Calais commune. Rejecting that appeal, the Conseil d’État ruled that the treatment of migrants was inhuman. “The Conseil d’État considers that these living conditions reveal a failure by the public authorities that has exposed these people to inhuman or degrading treatment,” the court said in a statement. “These shortcomings are a serious and unlawful infringement on a fundamental freedom.” On Monday the court said the lower court was within its rights to order the provision of toilets, drinking water and showers. While Macron has called for migrants to be treated with dignity, his own government has taken a tough stance, refusing to open a new migrant reception centre in Calais, saying it would act as a magnet for other migrants. Last week, Human Rights Watch pressed France to end what it described as recurrent police violence against refugees and migrants in Calais, where hundreds have returned despite the demolition of the sprawling camp. The European Union is struggling to find a coherent answer to a migration crisis that has tested cooperation between member states. Macron has instructed his government to speed up France’s asylum process."
2017-12-17T20:50:03Z,"Nepali migrant workers ‘systematically’ exploited, Amnesty says","Nepali migrant workers continue to be trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation, according to new research by Amnesty International. A survey by Amnesty has found two-thirds of migrant workers have paid excessive or illegal recruitment fees. The phone survey of 414 Nepali migrant workers found 88% paid fees to agents for their jobs overseas. The fees were claimed to be so high that the majority had to borrow more than half the sum from village moneylenders, placing them in debt. More than half of the workers surveyed – 53% – said they received lower monthly salaries than was promised to them by recruitment agents. James Lynch, the deputy director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme, said: “Nepali migrant workers are being systematically and mercilessly set up. Forced to take out loans to pay the huge fees recruitment agencies charge them to work abroad, they are left so indebted they have no choice but to stay in jobs which often turn out to be low paid or dangerous. “The Nepali government’s weak enforcement of the law is playing straight into the hands of extortionists and loan sharks,” he said. “Migrant workers all too often end up trapped in a soul-destroying situation of working abroad for years simply to pay off huge, often illegal fees they were charged to take the job. Tackling this exploitative industry is a matter of urgency.”"
2017-11-16T13:14:42Z,"Teenage Nigerian girls drowned at sea, Italian autopsies confirm","Autopsies on the bodies of 26 Nigerian teenage girls recovered from the Mediterranean this month have confirmed that they drowned. The bodies of the girls, aged between 14 and 18, were brought to the southern Italian port of Salerno by the Spanish ship Cantabria on 5 November. An investigation was opened due to fears they may have been abused and killed. But Prof Antonello Crisci, a medic who worked on the postmortems, said the girls died from drowning after the dinghies they were travelling in sank. “There were no signs that they had been raped or physically abused,” he said. “They most likely couldn’t swim.” The bodies were recovered by Cantabria, which works as part of the EU’s Sophia anti-trafficking operation, from two shipwrecks – 23 from one and three from the other. One of the women also suffered a “hemorrhagic shock” due to a liver wound, and two were pregnant, the doctor added. At least 100 other migrants who were also attempting the treacherous crossing from Libya to Europe are missing and almost certain to have drowned, prosecutors said on Wednesday. A further 375 people were brought to safety across two search-and-rescue missions. Two men, who were among the survivors and are believed to have skippered one of the boats, were arrested in Salerno the day after the bodies were brought to the port on charges of people trafficking. Marco Rotunno, an Italy spokesman for the UN refugee agency, told the Guardian last week that 90% of migrant and refugee women arrive in the country with bruises or other signs of violence. People continue to attempt the crossing despite a pact between Italy and Libya to stem the flow, which led to a near 70% drop in arrivals since the summer, according to figures released this month by Italy’s interior ministry. Italy defended the agreement on Wednesday after it was lambasted by the UN human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, as being “inhuman”. Rights groups have denounced the policy, saying it exposes returned migrants to Libya’s lawless detention centres with no legal recourse. There have long been reports of the horrific abuses suffered by migrants in war-stricken Libya at the hands of traffickers and others, with the International Organisation for Migration saying in April that thousands of Africans are being sold in “slave markets”. “The suffering of migrants detained in Libya is an outrage to the conscience of humanity,” Hussein said in a statement issued on Tuesday. “The European Union’s policy of assisting the Libyan coastguard to intercept and return migrants in the Mediterranean [is] inhuman.” Italy’s interior minister, Marco Minniti, defended the deal, saying: “The alternative cannot be to resign ourselves to the impossibility of managing migratory flows and hand human traffickers the keys to European democracies. “We invite all those who are giving lessons to instead give more funds, more logistical support and more intervention in Libya to solve this issue.”"
2017-12-06T09:55:35Z,Greek refugee camps 'beyond desperate' as islanders protest in Athens,"Humanitarian groups have warned of a looming emergency on Greece’s eastern Aegean islands, the day after residents converged on Athens in protest at policies that have led to thousands of migrants and refugees being marooned in reception centres. A surge in arrivals from neighbouring Turkey has seen numbers soar with officials speaking of a four-fold increase in men, women and children seeking asylum on Chios, Kos, Leros, Lesbos and Samos. Conditions are deteriorating in the vastly overcrowded camps in a situation that Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on Wednesday warned was “beyond desperate”. “In Lesbos, entire families who recently arrived from countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are packed into small summer tents, under the rain and in low temperatures struggling to keep dry and warm,” said Aria Danika, MSF’s project coordinator on the island. “In our mental health clinic we have received an average of 10 patients with acute mental distress every day, including many who tried to kill themselves or self-harm. The situation on the island was already terrible. Now it’s beyond desperate.” Demonstrators – led by delegations of officials from Chios, Lesbos and Samos – gathered in the Athens sunshine on Tuesday to demand that the government move people out of camps. “Action has to be taken now, before it is too late,” said Panos Pitsios, president of the town council of Mytilene, Lesbos’s capital. “We are heading towards an eruption, a situation that is on the verge of getting out of control.” The island, the gateway for an estimated 800,000 refugees and migrants who entered Europe at the height of the refugee crisis two years ago, is now housing more than 7,000 people in facilities with a capacity of 2,300. The strategy of stranding migrants and refugees in remote camps where tensions have also mounted between rival ethnicities has also been condemned by human rights groups. Organisations increasingly fear that unless asylum seekers are transferred to the mainland where facilities are less crowded and better equipped, thousands could be left out in the cold as winter approaches. As of last week, reception centres on the isles were almost 7,200 over capacity, condemning inmates to live in appalling conditions with lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities and health services. Mayors from all five islands said in a proclamation handed to the migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, that Athens’ containment policies had turned their communities into “island prisons”. “There has to be immediate decongestion of the islands,” Chios’s mayor, Manolis Vournous, told the Guardian. “There simply isn’t the infrastructure to cope.” About 2,500 people, he said, were currently stuck in Vial, the island’s main camp, purpose-built to hold no more than 800. “It is an intolerable situation that is putting human lives at risk and endangering social cohesion. It has to end.” The leftist-led Greek government argues it is hamstrung by a landmark accord reached between the EU and Turkey to stem the flows last year. Under the agreement, asylum seekers arriving on Greek islands must remain in situ until their requests are approved – a process made longer by a notoriously slow-moving justice system that has been impacted by the country’s long-running economic crisis. The enforced wait is exacerbated by the spectre that, if rejected, asylum seekers will be forcibly returned to Turkey. In recent weeks, prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s administration has taken steps to alleviate the situation – transferring hundreds of migrants by ship to Athens. Mouzalas recently announced that the government was also considering renting hotels and dispatching cruise ships to the islands to house the growing numbers over the winter months. But with more than 15,000 people officially registered in state-run camps on the isles, the measures were described as “hopelessly inadequate” by locals. “More than a third of Mytilene’s total population are migrants and refugees,” said Pitsios. “Residents are afraid at night to even leave their homes and now they are at the end of their tether.”"
2017-11-08T18:33:48Z,Migrants only cross borders as last resort | Letters,"You are right that migrants attempt the journey to Europe even though they know the risks (They know the risks and still they come: why young Africans chase the European dream, theguardian.com, 6 November). This is because they have no choice, and there are not enough safe and legal routes available. They are fleeing persecution, abuse and poverty and migrating is a last resort for the majority. Our new report released this week based on interviews with 67 Eritreans shows that the joint EU-Africa policy intended to help migrants and refugees, known as the Khartoum Process, is in fact part of the problem. It pushes the problem offshore and creates risks for vulnerable people. Our findings show that people decide to cross borders irregularly and take extreme risks when alternative options are perceived to be equally bad, or worse. What policy makers view as an ill-informed decision is often calculated risk-taking. Most of those fleeing persecution, human rights abuses, conflict and poverty are not even attempting to get to Europe and remain in the region. We argue that a new approach is needed – one in which there is a shift in focus on to the political context in which migration takes place, rather than the criminality that it attracts. Tackling the symptoms rather than the causes of migration will do little to change the current equation in which people take considerable risks for want of alternatives.

2017-11-03T17:11:42Z,Europe’s top human rights job deserves better. We urge Greece to choose again | Kostis Papaioannou and Vassilis Papadopoulos,"The Greek government’s decision to put forward its current minister of migration as a candidate for Europe’s top human rights job must seem reasonable to many people outside Greece. Our country was forced to deal with record arrivals of refugees at a time when it is already struggling to emerge from a serious financial crisis. The humanity displayed by many Greeks in responding to these twin crises has earned the country the moral right to be heard. But the nomination of Ioannis Mouzalas for Human Rights Commissioner at the Council of Europe has caused serious concern in Greece itself. His term as migration minister is not one that has promoted respect for human rights. The choice of this commissioner is of particular importance because the role oversees human rights conditions and detects problems in law and administrative practice; it also proposes recommendations and follows up on their implementation. The commissioner must act according to the basic principles of the Council of Europe, an institutional pillar for the protection of human rights. The incumbent, Nils Muiznieks, has expressed serious concern about the deal struck between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to stem the flow of Syrian refugees into Greece, in which aid and political concessions were offered to Ankara. The Greek minister, on the contrary, has been one of the most ardent protectors of this controversial agreement. He has insisted on implementation of the deal and refused any input from national and international stakeholders regarding its impact on human rights. In cases where the EU-Turkey deal has not been implemented fully, and no Syrian refugee has been forcibly returned to Turkey, this is because of the determined resistance of civil society organisations as well as public servants. When the independent committees that decide asylum appeal claims in Greece ruled in favour of claimants who were resisting being sent back to Turkey, Mouzalas was accused of intervening to influence their decisions. When this did not work, he amended the law to change the composition of the committees and speed up the return of Syrians to Turkey. This interference directly contradicted the principles of the Council of Europe – the very body in which he is now a candidate for a senior role. The minister’s support for the EU Turkey deal should at least have triggered unease about nominating him for a top institutional position. Especially one that implies an unwavering stance in support of human rights in general, and respect for the rights of refugees in particular. We presume that consistency with the principles of the Council of Europe will be taken into account when the nominees are considered. Far from there being positive work leading to his nomination, there is, unfortunately, plenty of evidence of the opposite. Multiple reports from Greek and international organisations, including an investigation in the Guardian, have raised very serious reservations about the management of the refugee issue. The EU policy, backed by the Greek government, has led to thousands of refugees and migrants being trapped in unacceptable conditions on the Greek islands. Last winter this confinement to the islands and mismanagement led to the loss of life. There has been no meaningful investigation to establish responsibility for these deaths. The failure to provide adequate camp facilities or the structures and rules needed to properly administer the refugee population belongs in part to Mouzalas. The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, among others, has already warned about the danger of a repeat of similar failings this winter. The policy supported by Mouzalas has also placed an unreasonable burden on local communities on the islands where new arrivals are confined. This was done without any planning or attempts to gain local support and has resulted in a serious risk of social and political unrest. This agreement is becoming a paradigm on how to undermine the post-second world war refugee protection apparatus. Its strict implementation has badly damaged the rule of law. Even if Greece had no choice but to accept the EU-Turkey deal, what we have managed is the worst possible version: entrapping and dehumanising asylum seekers in a punitive way beyond what the deal formally envisioned. We often criticize the negative political stance of central European countries that target refugees and do not take their share of responsibility as EU members. But for this criticism to be essential, we ought to contrast it with our own politics. It is clear that the Greek government should think again on its decision to propose Mouzalas as a candidate for human rights commissioner at the Council of Europe. • Kostis Papaioannou is the former secretary general for human rights in the Greek government.

2017-11-22T16:36:09Z,Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies spotted in the UK,"Record numbers of rare migrant dragonflies have been spotted in the UK this year, according to an analysis by volunteers from the Migrant Dragonfly Project. The study recorded the first confirmed UK sighting of the scarlet darter for 13 years, at Longham Lakes in Dorset. It is only the eighth time this species has been spotted in Britain. Volunteers also recorded the second largest ever immigration of red-veined darters into the UK, and there have been multiple influxes of both vagrant emperor and lesser emperor dragonflies. Eleanor Colver, conservation officer for the British Dragonfly Society, said: “we are currently seeing major shifts in the range of dragonfly species on a global scale, not just in the UK.” She added: “Dragonflies, like all insects, cannot regulate their body temperature like humans, so are highly sensitive to small changes in environmental temperature. As a result, we believe that some of the changes we are witnessing in our local dragonflies are their response to the ongoing global warming.” Adrian Parr, co-ordinator of the Migrant Dragonfly Project, said the record number in the UK was helped by warm weather and southerly winds in spring and early summer as well as good breeding conditions in the traditional dragonfly homelands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Unlike the situation with birds, whose migrations are well-known, our understanding of insect (and particularly dragonfly) migration is still in its infancy,” said Parr. “It is clearly, however, an important phenomenon, and one that tells us a lot about the living world.” Parr said scarlet darters are usually found across central Europe, Africa, the Middle East and western Asia and that they are “one of the most generalist dragonfly species, able to live in a variety of standing-water habitats, ranging from brackish pools to freshwater ditches.” According to the project, Britain has been colonised by four new species of dragonfly in the past 20 years, including the willow emerald damselfly and small red-eyed damselfly, and seen the return of the dainty damselfly, which had last been seen in 1953."
2017-12-26T11:00:46Z,Desperate plight of Rohingya refugees hits home in Bradford,"It took the best part of 36 hours to travel from his Victorian terrace home in Bradford to the ever-growing refugee camp in southern Bangladesh. But of the 5,000 mile trip it was the final few hundred metres that were the hardest. “When I was 500 metres from my parents home I was crying loudly,” said Deen Mohammed Noori. The 32-year-old had been reunited with his parents after nine years; their address is printed in black ink on official UN records: Kutupalong, Block D, Shed 0026. Noori’s parents are among hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees living in what has rapidly become the world’s largest refugee camp, with nearly 1 million stateless people living in makeshift settlements on the edge of Kutupalong, near Cox’s Bazar. For Noori, the bamboo and tarpaulin huts are a reminder of the life he was fortunate enough to escape in 2010, when he was among 199 Rohingya refugees who settled in Bradford under the International Organisation for Migration’s gateway protection programme. The Bradford Rohingyas, the biggest community of the ethnic group in Europe, have watched with increasing horror as more than 670,000 of their ethnic group – often described as the “world’s most persecuted people” – have fled the destruction of their villages in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Noori now works as a taxi driver in Bradford while running the Arakan Rohingya Organisation UK from his family home in the centre of the city, where he lives with his wife and children. He returned from his four-week trip to Kutupalong on 30 November with graphic horror stories and a renewed determination to ask the British government for sanctuary for his elderly relatives. “My mum didn’t want me to come back here. I wanted to bring my parents with me. Why can’t I take them with with me to the country where I live? It was a sad moment for me when I was coming back to the airport,” he said. “Every time we go out ... we feel sad all the time. We feel disappointed because my parents are not here.” The city council has given the Rohingya community a small office in a community centre in the Laisterdyke neighbourhood of east Bradford, where they can meet and organise. In October, Nijam Uddin Mohammed, general secretary of the British Rohingya Community UK, and nine others took aid to desperate families in Kutupalong, donating food, firewood and medicine from the people of Bradford. Although the vast majority of Rohingya refugees are Muslim, the donations came from every faith and none, said Mohammed. “Donations came from all over Bradford regardless of faith. We’ve been very surprised: the mosques, churches, temples – everyone has come out to help us.” Nur Huda, chairman of the British Rohingya Community UK, took his 11-year-old daughter, Nurun Nessa Sumai, on the 5,000-mile journey to the country where they had lived in exile until 2008, when they were among the first Rohingya refugees to be welcomed to Bradford under its City of Sanctuary scheme. Sumai, who started secondary school in September at Bradford’s Feversham college for girls, said she had returned to Yorkshire with a new appreciation for the most basic things in life. “Here [children] take everything for granted, and they [children in Kutupalong] are just hoping they have parents, proper education, nice food, nice clothes and everything, good toys to play with, find friends and all the things we take for granted today,” she said. “We get water, they don’t have that much clean water. They don’t have anything – they have to sleep on the streets. They never know if someone’s going to trip over them or anything. They’re just lying there hoping that something good will happen to them, but they don’t have much hope now.” Of all the distressing sights and stories in Kutupalong, Mohammed said, it was the plight of the children that raised the greatest alarm. More than 600,000 Rohingya children are at risk in both Myanmar and Bangladesh, according to Unicef, which estimates that almost 60% of the nearly 1 million people to have fled the violence are children – and 21% of those under five are malnurished. Mohammed, who grew up in Kutupalong, said he feared the lack of education was the greatest threat to the future of his people. Fewer than 1% of 720,000 children classed as “in need” are currently receiving any form of education, according to Unicef. “Nearly 1 million people, their children are without education. What are these children’s destinations going to be? “Sometimes you kill people with weapons. This time, if children are away from education, then my Rohingya nation will be completely disappeared slowly,” he said."
2017-08-21T17:04:28Z,Pope Francis: prioritise migrants' dignity over national security,"Pope Francis has issued a 20-point action plan to governments on refugees and migrants to try to galvanise their response to an issue seen by the Vatican as one of the biggest global challenges of the 21st century. His intention is to lay the ground for the drafting of two global compacts on refugees and migration, which are expected to be adopted at the UN general assembly in September 2018. The roadmap was published on Monday by the Vatican’s migrants and refugees section, which was set up by Francis last year and operates under his direction. The action points were personally approved by the pontiff. In a message issued before publication, Francis said he had “repeatedly expressed my particular concern for the lamentable situation of many migrants and refugees fleeing from war, persecution, natural disasters and poverty”. The situation was “undoubtedly a ‘sign of the times’,” he said. The document, Responding to Refugees and Migrants: Twenty Action Points, says the world is facing “the largest movement of displaced people in recent memory”. It says: “While massive numbers of people have been forced to leave their homes due to persecution, violence, natural disasters and the scourge of poverty, migration should nevertheless be recognised, not as a new phenomenon, but rather as a natural human response to crisis and a testament to the innate desire of every human being for happiness and a better life. “This reality, with its important cultural and spiritual dimensions, is having a significant impact on attitudes and reactions all over the world.” The document’s 20 points are grouped in four calls to action: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate. Their “ultimate goal is the building of an inclusive and sustainable common home for all”. Before detailing the action plan, the authors suggest that distinguishing between migrants and refugees, as the UN does in its separate compacts, is problematic. “Empirical evidence shows that migration is more and more mixed. This makes it difficult to maintain a clear-cut distinction between migrants and refugees. Often their needs are very similar if not identical,” the document says. Among its action points are the creation of legal pathways for safe and voluntary migration and resettlement, and a ban on arbitrary and collective expulsions. It suggests states make wider use of humanitarian, student and family reunification visas. The document says greater support should be available for countries that have borne the brunt of migration: more than half the world’s displaced people are in Africa and the Middle East, with 17% in Europe, according to the UN. In his message, Francis said personal safety and dignity should be prioritised over national security and, “for the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorisation”. Francis has indicated that migration should be a major Vatican focus in the run-up to the 2018 UN general assembly. He has made the issue central to his papacy since visiting the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, where thousands of migrants have landed, within weeks of his election. He has also housed several Syrian refugee families in the Vatican. Graham Gordon, of the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “The Holy Father is making clear that all countries must step up to the plate and pull their weight. “This is one of the greatest crises of the century so far. Not for the first time, the pope is reminding politicians that history will judge whether they rise to the challenge or abdicate their responsibility.” Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s anti-immigrant Northern League party, wrote on Facebook: “If you want to do it in the Vatican, go ahead. But as a Catholic, I don’t think Italy can welcome and support the whole world.”"
2017-07-24T04:00:26Z,European and African ministers discuss plan to tackle flow of refugees,"European and African ministers are to meet in Tunis on Monday to discuss a plan to try to regularise the flow of refugees from Africa to Europe to about 20,000, coupled with a much tougher strategy to deport illegal migrants from Italy and break up smuggling rings. The plan to regularise the migrant flow is being pushed by the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, which warns that EU efforts to train the Libyan coastguard along with Italy’s intention to impose a new code of conduct on NGO rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean do not match the scale of the problem, or recognise the extent to which the flow of refugees and migrants is likely to become permanent. The aim is to set up screening systems for EU-bound migrants in countries en route to Libya, such as Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Chad and Sudan. The EU at a meeting in July set aside enough cash for 40,000 regularised refugees, with as many as half coming from claimants in Syria, and the remainder from Africa. Although the European commission has struggled to persuade all countries to take migrants after a similar scheme set up in following the 2015 migration crisis from Syria, the new scheme would represent a form of solidarity, and provide Italy with some relief. Italy is gripped by deep political and civil divisions on the issue, with more than 90,000 migrants reaching Italy from Libya this year. A reduction to 20,000 from Africa would represent a transformation. Explaining the thinking, Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s new special envoy to the central Mediterranean, said: “We need to regularise the system and stop these dangerous journeys into Libya. Any remedy that focuses on trying to stop the flow of migrants at sea, such as a code of conduct for a NGOs, cannot be the solution. The issue has to be addressed earlier in the countries of origin and transit. “Italy also needs to be able to process claimants so the economic migrants are returned much more quickly, or else there will be no deterrent to travel to Italy. Only a third of the migrants reaching Italy are found to be in need of international protection.” He added that by the time migrants reached Libya it was often too late. It is thought there are 300,000 Africans from outside Libya trying to get across to Europe or to get some work in Libya. They are living in Libyan detention centres or in warehouses or so-called “connection houses” in the hands of traffickers. The refugees need to be taken out of Libya and these detention centres so they can be processed elsewhere. He added: “There has been a lot of rhetoric about closing down the smugglers’ business model, but little has happened, but it has to be done more seriously than at present … Many of the people smugglers can be identified as they advertise their services on Facebook, but little has been done to try to seize their assets or impose travel bans and other sanctions. “There tends to be action against the small fry, like the people that steer the boats to Libya in return for a discount on the journey. They are not the people responsible for this system.” UNHCR recognises that it is necessary to train and capacitate the Libyan coastguards, but there is also a need to prevent human rights abuses and to investigate incidents of collusion with traffickers. In the first six months of this year, 2,171 refugees and migrants died or went missing in the central Mediterranean, and many others are believed to have died trying to cross into Libya."
2017-12-17T12:56:12Z,The Jungle review – devastating yet uplifting story of the migrant crisis,"‘How did you survive?” asks a young British volunteer of a refugee in the migrant camp that sprang up out of the mud like a small city near Calais. “We didn’t,” comes the reply. “We are different now.” The migrant camp known as the Jungle housed thousands of refugees and hundreds of unaccompanied minors from 2015 until it was bulldozed in late 2016. The journey to Calais was always a long and difficult one for everyone who came, and there were many kinds of death along the way. Yet these living ghosts are vibrant and vivid, full of life and resilience in this teeming play written by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, the founders of Good Chance, a theatre company that sprang up in the camp alongside the shops, the school and the Afghan restaurant run by Salar (Ben Turner). The late AA Gill paid a visit and reviewed it favourably. Miriam Buether’s design places the audience in the restaurant, a ramshackle place of plywood tables, ill-matching chairs and benches, and a patchwork roof fashioned from flimsy material. Bread is handed around: even amid the arguments and disagreements, the struggle to survive from day to day, the hopes raised and dashed over and over, there is always bread and hospitality. When Sam (Alex Lawther), an 18-year-old posh boy, arrives at the camp, he describes it as “Glastonbury without the toilets”. Only, after Glastonbury everybody goes home. The people in the Jungle are looking for a permanent home, preferably in the UK. Everyone, it seems, has an uncle in Leicester. One teenager gives a demonstration of the ringtone on his phone: the melody of The White Cliffs of Dover curls across the theatre and has never sounded so melancholy. Many of the young men never miss the weekly phone call to their mothers in Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria or Eritrea, but they lie to them and tell them they are already in the UK, in school or at work, finding it unbearable to admit that they are caught in the purgatory of the camp looking for “the good chance” as a stowaway in a lorry or on Eurostar that will take them to the promised land. Whenever there is a traffic jam on the motorway, the restaurant suddenly empties. If someone does make it to England and gets word back, a cry of joy goes up all around the camp. Too often the attempt ends in interment in the mud in Angel’s Corner, the camp’s burial ground. Like the Afghan restaurant and the camp itself, Murphy and Robertson’s play, delicately directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, in a co-production by the Young Vic, the National Theatre and Good Chance, has a makeshift quality. That always operates in its favour. It never sets itself up as a definitive story about the camp. There is nothing neat and tidy about the Jungle or the way human beings behave under pressure or what motivates an individual’s actions. The emotions are always big, because the stakes are so high. The story begins at the end and then snakes back on itself, told by a 35-year-old Syrian, Salfi (Ammar Haj Ahmed), a former English literature student from Aleppo, whose quiet affability disguises his increasing desperation. It’s not a sophisticated piece of theatre, but it is an extraordinarily effective one. Characters are lightly but vividly drawn and full of complexity. There is Okot (John Pfumojena), the 17-year-old whose journey from Sudan has left many different kinds of scar; the Afghan teenager Norullah (Mohammad Amiri), who becomes crazed by his desire to get to England, and Helene (Nahel Tzegai), a woman who can calm the fractious men, and is working towards her own decision about what is best for her and her family. The British volunteers, many of whom turn up following photographs in the media of Alan Kurdi, the little Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach, are no less complicated in the reasons why they have come, and how they behave while they are there. Everyone is changed, particularly Sam. This is not a play that judges individuals but one that holds governments to account. The British and French authorities are shown not just failing to help, but turning their backs on a humanitarian catastrophe. Theresa May, then home secretary, comes in for particular opprobrium for her attempts to circumvent the right of unaccompanied minors living in the camp who have relatives in the UK from exercising it. A small, silent girl, Amal (Aliya Ali), haunts the action, as if representing all the lost children who never made it even to Calais, all the futures denied and dreams crushed. This devastating, uplifting show is beady-eyed even as it celebrates the human capacity to build something out of nothing, to work together and try to make a difference. Good Chance – returning to France in January to set up a theatre in a migrant centre in the north of Paris – is doing just that. Let’s listen and learn. At the Young Vic, London, until 9 January. Box office: 020-7922 2922."
2017-12-15T04:00:10Z,Second cohort of Nauru and Manus refugees to be resettled in US,"Nearly 200 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention islands of Nauru and Manus will be resettled in the United States in the new year. But the newly-reinstated travel ban imposed by US president Donald Trump is excluding certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranian refugees have been told the president’s executive order has meant “the United States government is currently undertaking an additional review of refugees resettlement from selected countries worldwide and will temporarily prioritise refugee applications from other countries”. “This means that refugees processing from selected countries, including in your resettlement case, will occur at a slower pace.” The Trump travel ban, reinstated by the US supreme court earlier this month, suspends the entry into the US of nationals from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela. Iranians make up the largest cohort of refugees on both of Australia’s offshore processing centres. The Guardian understands about 130 people from Nauru have been accepted to move to the US, and close to 60 from PNG. The group will be the second cohort resettled under the US deal brokered in 2016, after 54 refugees went to the US in September. The majority of refugees accepted for resettlement in the current group are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and stateless Rohingyans from Myanmar and Bangladesh. On Nauru, young men from Afghanistan and Pakistan, who arrived on the island as unaccompanied children but have since reached adulthood, have been accepted for resettlement. Some Iranian refugees have been rejected. Several families, from Iran and Sri Lanka, have also been rejected. On Manus, Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat said those accepted for resettlement had been told they will leave for the United States on 12 January. “Those who received their results today were so excited that they will fly to the US … and the others in the camps are so sad because their names are not on the list. I hope everyone will get his freedom to a safe country soon. “The US deal will take many months or years and will not provide places for everyone. We will continue our protests on Manus until there is a safe country for everyone.” Ezatullah Kakar, a Pakistani refugee, told the Guardian he was still waiting for an interview for his resettlement. His roommate has left Manus for Port Moresby, ahead of flying to the United States next month. “We are still waiting. Of course it’s hard. And it’s the same game, like other people on our boats, we were all in Christmas Island and they went to Australia and we were sent to Manus.” Kakar said the US resettlement process would likely take months for those still waiting for initial interviews. “It’s very hard; I can’t believe they are wasting all this time.” Last week, Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton said the resettlement process was the bailiwick of US authorities, but that the process was progressing. “I am hoping there can be an uplift as soon as possible but that is an issue for the United States ... and interviews continue, the background checks, and all of that process that the United States is involved in continues.” Department sources say there is increasing confidence the US will accept close to the 1,250 refugees it has previously publicly suggested could be settled, and that that figure could be reached by the end of its current annual intake, which resets in October. The 1,250 would not be enough to clear Australia’s offshore islands of refugees. There are about 1,600 refugees currently held in both Nauru and PNG. Asylum seekers found not to meet the criteria for protection under the refugees’ convention are not being considered for US resettlement. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said the latest cohort to be accepted for resettlement was “great news” for those selected. “But it also exposes all the problems that exist with the US deal: the selective nature of the agreement; the travel ban having an impact. People have been waiting over four years, but so many still don’t know what is going to happen to them. “The US deal is not going to provide enough places for all the people found to be owed protection. That has created enormous anxiety and distress.”"
2017-10-01T07:00:11Z,The Road to Mandalay review – potent migrant drama,"This potent drama about two migrants who meet as they flee the civil war in Burma for a new life in Thailand hits many of the expected beats of stories about the stateless displaced. Even so, the stylistically bold approach that director Midi Z brings to the struggle of Lianqing and Guo, the boy who loves her, sets this apart. A combination of tender details – the way Guo carefully picks the fibres from his girlfriend’s skin after a gruelling shift at the factory – and a strikingly surreal approach to a scene in which Lianqing prostitutes herself for the first time makes this unflinching picture a notable addition to the ever-swelling list of films that deal with migration."
2017-11-30T13:05:40Z,Voluntary evacuation planned for migrants as Libya battles slavery claims,"A plan for a voluntary evacuation of migrants in Libya government-controlled detention camps has been put at the heart of an emergency migration plan for Africa. Leaders from the European Union and the African Union arrived for a summit in Ivory Coast on Wednesday vowing to take action following CNN’s shocking video footage of slave auction houses in Libya. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, described the abuse of migrants as “a crime against humanity” and said that the EU and AU would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks”. In an interview with France 24, Macron said he was not advocating sending foreign troops to Libya, adding: “It’s not about declaring war, Libya is a state in political transition ... but there’s reinforced police action that needs to be done to dismantle those networks. We’ll do it.” He also called for “individual, financial and physical sanctions” against human-trafficking networks, which he said were closely linked to terror groups in the region. The plan, which could see up to 15,000 people flown out of Libya, requires the government to allow the UN’s evacuation planes to land, as well as for source countries to come to a holding centre in Tripoli and take back their citizens. Migrants without documentation would be held until their case is resolved. The EU is likely to provide the funding, which in effect dramatically speeds up a voluntary repatriation scheme already being run by the International Organization for Migration. Opening the summit, the Ivorian president, Alassane Ouattara, said: “Given this wretched drama which recalls the worst hours of human history, I would like to appeal to our sense of responsibility to take all urgent measures to put an end to this practice, which belongs to another age.” Some African leaders also expressed anger at the Libyan government, with the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, claiming it was appalling that his compatriots were being sold “like goats”. In a rare press conference on Thursday, the Libyan embassy in London said every effort was being made to investigate claims of slavery auction markets, adding anyone found guilty would be charged under a 1953 law banning slavery. Mohamed Alkoni, the Libyan charge d’affaires, insisted throughout his life he had “never seen or heard any signs of racism in Libya”, and added any proven allegations of slavery “is an act of an individual, and not a systematic practice”. The practices, if proven, “contravene all the values, traditions and customs of the Libyan people”, he said. No cases had been put before the Libyan courts prior to the CNN allegations, he said, suggesting that the news of the slave auctions had come as a surprise to ministers. He also said the Libyan state lacked the resources to oversee the detention centres fully. “You are talking about a large number of detention centres and it is not easy to control them”. Migration was already at the top of the agenda for the first AU-EU summit since 2014, but the footage of markets in Libya injected immediacy into the issue, spurring French government calls at the UN on Tuesday for sanctions against identified traffickers, the closure of migrant detention camps and renewed calls for Europe to accept more African migrants on a managed basis. More than 3,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Italy this year, it was confirmed this week. AU states are eager to ensure that the Libyan crisis does not detract from an agenda to address the long-term causes of migration, including poor governance, climate change and absence of private sector investment. They also want EU commitments on the number of migrants it is willing to take. France has promised to accept at least 3,000 from Niger and Chad over two years. Both Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have promised to make Africa a priority, but details of EU funds for Africa are often opaque. Macron is on a three-day tour of Africa and, in his first major address on the continent before a crowd of university students in Burkina Faso on Tuesday, said he wanted Africa and Europe to “help populations trapped in Libya by providing massive support to the evacuation of endangered people”. Conscious that France, by backing the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, is seen as having a large share of responsibility for Libya’s current political disarray, Macron reiterated his criticisms of French intervention in Libya under Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011. “I would not have supported the intervention in Libya,” he said, “because there was not a diplomatic vision or diplomatic solution.” Taking questions from the students in Burkina Faso, Macron downplayed the idea of European countries opening their doors to more direct migration from Africa. “If you say, ‘I’ve got a right to total access without conditions’ ... I can’t explain that to my [lower middle class], who have worked, who pay their taxes,” he said. “What do I tell them?”"
2017-12-22T16:07:09Z,Graffiti about sex with refugees stunned me – but I wasn’t surprised | Jade Jackman,"As our cities’ skylines spiral upwards, we have grown accustomed to increasingly bad street art. For self-preservation, we train our eyes to dull the slogans that cover the buildings that gentrification means many can no longer afford to enter, but the white words painted on a wall in Shoreditch, east London, will stay with me: “Sex with refugees is jasmine-scented and beautiful”. The words, which have now been painted over, stunned me. Artist Robert Montgomery says that the words were ripped from another piece of his. This reads: “The refugees are beautiful, they bring ancient music and desert sweets and jasmine-filled sex”, which he happily posted for us all to see. On Facebook he denied creating the Shoreditch graffiti. But either version of the sentiment shows ignorance over the words and social misconceptions about the current refugee crisis. It is with a deep bitterness that it has to be spelled out that neither love nor sex is the solution. My mother was born in Malaysia, and this language echoes the colonial narrative that makes me feel sick. Throughout history, women of colour have been presented as alluring and tantalisingly exotic. The repercussions of this are felt through porn, advertising and experiences that women of colour have while dating. This piece of art mirrors that. The choice of language presents sex with another human as essentially different, foreign or fetish. This is not a great basis for relationships nor a way to bring about racial equality. As Jinan Petra, a campaigner against immigration detention, tells me: “To write such racist, orientalist, harmful bullshit about people who have been through so much – including sexual violence – in migration ... there are very few words. I’m a Syrian woman and in my professional and personal life I know that these views exist; the sentiment and the entitlement don’t surprise me.” From my own work with female refugees, I am painfully aware of the sexual violence that vulnerable people face. While preparing to teach film-making to young asylum seekers and undocumented youth, we were faced with the grim reality that assault and rape were common. Not only is the journey notoriously perilous, the dangers don’t stop when you arrive in Britain. Without secure status, you are at the whim of those around you. For some, this has meant staying in abusive “romantic” relationships, while others have faced sexual violence from guards inside detention facilities. Even if you do happen to be in a loving relationship, Theresa May’s “hostile environment” can make it difficult. One evening, as the sun set, I awkwardly looked away as a man told his wife he loved her inside Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre. “Don’t touch her,” a guard barked. They dropped their hands, wondering if this is what intimacy meant now. All the love in the world means nothing without money for a visa. While the Shoreditch “artwork” is disappointing, its obliviousness comes as no surprise. In British schools, we are not taught the true legacies of colonialism nor how people’s livelihoods have been damaged by our warfare. This accounts for people’s shock over the treatment of migrants in Libya. Often, the charity campaigns surrounding the refugee crisis are no better. Take the Save the Children advert that attempted to garner sympathy through the narrative of a white young girl, asking what if this happened in Europe. It ignored and erased the historical reasons as to why this is not happening here. Similarly, statements such as “refugees are welcome” is a powerful rallying cry but ignores that the UK has one of the biggest and most cruel detention facilities in Europe. Refugees can be held indefinitely. This is how our government “secures” our borders; it isn’t something we can shag away. From the perspective of Aleksandra Bilic, a film-maker who came to this country as a child refugee herself: “It is hard to realise that problems cannot be solved without confronting the greater factors at play and that these issues are beyond ourselves. But this is not a topic for artists to literally fuck with, as these are real issues. If you are going to speak on them, you should try and understand them.” This isn’t to say artists shouldn’t tackle political causes in their work. We need political art with teeth. But our talk of politics comes at a high cost. We have a responsibility to do our research, know the context that our work operates in and be genuinely informed about the cause we seek to amplify. If you do, it’ll prevent wasting time painting over shallow and harmful statements that nobody asked to see. • Jade Jackman is a documentary film-maker and writer based in London"

2017-12-08T13:00:03Z,Who are the charities we're supporting with our 2017 charity appeal?,"The Guardian and Observer 2017 charity appeal is supporting three charities working with young homeless people and asylum seekers, refugees and migrants facing destitution. Here’s a brief guide to what they do. Depaul UK Depaul UK is a national charity that works to end homelessness and change the lives of those affected by it. Its services include supported housing for homeless young people, family mediation, and leading the Nightstop emergency accommodation network across the UK. Nightstop operates in 34 towns and cities, giving young people a safe place to stay for the night in the spare room of volunteer hosts. Last year the Nightstop network gave 1,390 young people in desperate need a safe place to stay for the night. For many Nightstop guests, their first night in a volunteer’s home is the beginning of their journey out of homelessness as staff work to find safe and sustainable long-term accommodation following their stay. Depaul UK provides support with getting into education, training and employment for all the young people who live in its supported accommodation to help them rebuild their lives. Depaul UK helped 3,107 young people last year but the demand for new services is great. The No Accommodation Network (Naccom) Naccom’s mission is to end destitution among asylum seekers, refugees and migrants with no recourse to public funds living in the UK. It helps member organisations to develop their services and advocate for changes in the system. The network includes more than 40 full-member charities and projects that provide accommodation (including housing, night shelters and hosting schemes) to people who cannot access mainstream support and accommodation. In the last year it accommodated 1,907 people. Naccom will use its share of the Guardian and Observer appeal donations to capacity-build the network and support frontline projects via a selective grants process that will be open to its full members. Members are supported to gather and share data and stories that illustrate the extent and impact of destitution and the positive outcomes that can be achieved. Naccom works with others to ensure collaborative working where appropriate and shared learning across the wider homelessness and refugee and migrant sectors. Centrepoint Centrepoint is the UK’s leading charity for homeless young people. It supports more than 9,200 16- to 25-year-olds each year. It works directly in London, Yorkshire, Manchester and the north-east of England, and partners with other organisations across the UK. It provides a range of accommodation services for young people depending on their needs, including specialist services for single parents, young people leaving care and those escaping violence and abuse. Centrepoint aims to give young people the skills and resilience they need to live independently. The charity employs a team of counsellors and therapists to support young people with mental health and wellbeing issues. It runs healthy living and nutrition workshops and a sports programme to inspire confidence and positive change in young people. Young people are helped to enter or continue with education, training and employment, with support tailored to their needs. It works with young people to influence government policy with the overall aim of ending youth homelessness. Support our three chosen charities by donating here"
2017-11-27T03:37:04Z,China: 'ruthless' campaign to evict Beijing's migrant workers condemned,"More than a hundred Chinese intellectuals and scholars have decried a “ruthless” campaign to evict thousands of migrant workers from Beijing. The latest round of evictions began in the wake of a fire on 18 November that killed 19 people in an industrial neighbourhood in south Beijing, and 17 of the victims were migrants. City officials have declared a 40-day campaign against “illegal structures”, which for years have housed the millions of migrant workers who run Beijing’s restaurants, delivery companies, construction sites, retail shops and a host of small factories. The open letter, which was addressed to the country’s leadership and circulated on Chinese social media, called the evictions “a serious trampling of human rights”. Signatories included professors, researchers, poets and artists and more names continued to be added. It criticised the lack of due process and rapid speed at which the campaign was being implemented. Videos and photos posted on social media showed streets clogged with clothes and other belongings after migrants were given just minutes to pack up. Many who had lived in the Chinese capital for years were only allowed to take what they could carry before police sealed entire buildings. Authorities reportedly cut water and electrical service in some cases. “Any civilised and law abiding society cannot tolerate this, we must clearly condemn and oppose these actions,” the letter said. The haphazard nature of the mass evictions make it difficult to determine exactly how many people have been displaced. Migrants are being forced from their homes at the start of Beijing’s winter and temperature have hovered around freezing for the past week. China operated a national “household registration” system designed to control internal movement, meaning migrant workers lack many of the rights compared to native Beijingers. The system has been widely criticised for years and officials have pledged reform but have made little progress. Beijing officials have targeted a 15% cut in population of the downtown districts from 2014 levels within the next two years. That amounts to a reduction of about two million people, and authorities have also plan to demolish 40m square metres of illegal housing. International rights groups also condemned the campaign. “It’s somewhat astounding that the large numbers of migrant workers could be evicted so quickly, but this is in part because the Chinese authorities have systematically eroded all the ways people can protect their rights,” said William Nee, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong. “And, of course, China maintains the world’s largest censorship apparatus, so that it’s hard to meaningfully debate issues of injustice.” But Beijing officials denied they were targeting migrant workers at all, and said it was focused on safety. “It is irresponsible and groundless to say the campaign is to evict the ‘low-end population’,” an official from the Beijing Administration of Work Safety told local media."
2017-10-31T07:00:59Z,The refugees are in a state of terror on Manus | Behrouz Boochani,"Behrouz Boochani is a journalist and an Iranian refugee held on Manus Island since August 2014. The Guardian invited Boochani to keep a diary of the countdown to the closure of the Australian-run detention camp that is closing on Tuesday. Tuesday 31 October Last night the refugees were up until the early hours of the morning. You see, the department of immigration posted a document on the fences in the prison warning us that we only have until 5pm to exit the camp. If we remain we will be confronted with soldiers from the navy. This is a serious warning. It is a warning of impeding danger that has sent the refugees spiralling into terror. This is what has impelled the refugees to stay up until the morning. At 5am all the local and Australian guards have abandoned the camp. For the whole day there has not been a single person inside or around the parameters of the camp to protect the refugees. The situation has descended into an even worse crisis. At the same time we are receiving news from outside that the soldiers and police have armed themselves. The whole precarious situation has been militarised in a terribly perverse manner. However, no one knows for sure if the police and navy want to attack the refugees, or if they want to set upon the locals who have stolen everything from around the rim of the camp. Many of the locals have now entered the camp and are taking away whatever they can. The situation is perilous, it is volatile to such an extent that the refugees have been forced to lock the gates from the inside because of the possibility of an attack at any moment. The refugees are in a state of terror, but they have announced that they refuse to quit and leave the camp for Lorengau. After a few hours Senator Nick McKim and an ABC reporter enter the camp. Their presence here has instilled a sense of safety among the refugees. A number of refugees represent the drama that is unfolding here; they shed tears as they stand face-to-face with the ABC cameras. The other refugees feel that those few are reflecting the anguish felt by everyone else, those few shed tears that channel the sorrows of hundreds of refugees. The senator and ABC reporters have now left the camp, and the refugees once again have to grapple with the isolation. As I write, the refugees are engaged in a large meeting inside Delta camp; they have all decided not to leave the prison and continue resisting through peaceful means. The situation has reached a critical juncture, right now there is not enough food and water here – at 5pm they will also cut off the power. The hours that await us are going to be extremely harrowing intensely dangerous. Right now, the atmosphere in the camp is particularly unstable – an attack by the police and navy is imminent. The refugees are drawing on all their resources, their ingenuity and their sense of brotherhood to protect themselves from danger. Everyone realises that they have been abandoned and that this system, and this system alone, will dictate their fate. Constant anxiety, constant terror, constant aggression, constant affliction, unrelenting affliction. There is nowhere to go and various threats encircle the incarcerated refugees – we sense the malignance of the navy, the fury of police, we sense the unpredictability and volatility of the locals. We’re facing all these threats at the same time as feeling a deep sense of abandonment. Recently the refugees have repaired the fences that had been destroyed by the fallen tree in order to restore some security. But the fear of locals entering the camp has become a reality now with numerous people entering the prison and looting it. Security is the greatest danger that we face right now – no one feels safe in any way whatsoever and the threat of an attack looms over the prison and is deteriorating the fortitude of the refugees. Everyone here has gathered in Mike camp to discuss options and strategies – there is no choice but to gather here and find ways to support each other. The only thing left to do is find ways to resist if something were to happen suddenly. We have heard that around 200 locals have also gathered in East Lorengau outside the camp. They are protesting against our transfer to this new facility. They are shouting and protesting against removing us out of the current prison and into their community.

2017-11-29T23:33:51Z,"Muslim population in some EU countries could triple, says report","The Muslim population in some European countries could triple by 2050 while it will barely change in others, according to new projections released by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre. The report, Europe’s Growing Muslim Population, shows a stark west-east divide. The Muslim share of Germany’s population could grow from 6.1% in 2016 to 19.7% in 2050 if high migration continues, whereas over the border Poland’s share would change from 0.1% to 0.2% in the same scenario. Even if all current 28 EU members, plus Norway and Switzerland, closed their borders to migrants, the Muslim population share in the west would continue to grow owing to a younger age profile and higher fertility rates, but remain very low in the east. According to Pew’s data, Muslims made up 4.9% of Europe’s population in 2016, with an estimated 25.8 million people across 30 countries, up from 19.5 million people in 2010. The number of Muslim migrants arriving in Europe surged after 2014 to almost half a million annually, largely due to people fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Researchers considered three scenarios: zero migration between 2016 and 2050; medium migration, in which the flow of refugees stops but people continue to migrate for other reasons; and high migration, in which the record flow of migrants between 2014 and 2016 continues indefinitely with the same religious composition. In the zero migration scenario, the Muslim population in Europe is expected to rise from 4.9% to 7.4%. Apart from Cyprus, which has a high Muslim share (25.4%) due to the historical presence of Turkish Cypriots in the north of the island, France would have Europe’s biggest share of population with 12.7%, up from 8.8%. In the medium migration scenario - perhaps the most likely - Sweden would have the biggest share of population at 20.5%. The UK’s share would rise from 6.3% in 2016 to 16.7%. Finland’s Muslim share would grow from 2.7% to 11.4% and most western European countries would face a big jump. If high migration continues until 2050, Sweden’s Muslim share will grow to 30.6%, Finland’s to 15% and Norway’s to 17%. In eastern Europe, most countries will continue to have a relatively low Muslim share of population, with only Hungary and Greece seeing significant increases from 2016. Apart from migration, the number of Muslims in Europe is set to grow considerably through natural increases. Europe’s Muslims have more children than members of other religious groups, or people of no religion, the study shows. The European average fertility rate is 2.6 for Muslims compared to 1.6 for non-Muslims. The Muslim population is also much younger than non-Muslims. The proportion of Muslims under the age of 15 is 27%, nearly double the proportion of under-15 non-Muslims at 15%. “While Europe’s Muslim population is expected to grow in all three scenarios - and more than double in the medium and high migration scenarios – Europe’s non-Muslims, on the other hand, are projected to decline in total number in each scenario,” says the Pew report. Historically, a relatively small share of migrants to Europe were refugees from violence or persecution, with most coming for other reasons. Nearly half of all recent migrants to Europe were non-Muslims, with Christians making up the next largest group."
2017-11-23T17:00:20Z,Slovenia PM facing impeachment over support for refugee,"The prime minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, one of the few liberal leaders in central and eastern Europe, is facing impeachment over his support for a Syrian asylum seeker who is facing deportation. Should the country’s rightwing opposition party be successful in their motion, Cerar, the leader of the centrist moderate party, could be dismissed from office by the Slovenian MPs, although government sources insist the prime minister has enough support in parliament to vote down the motion. The future of Ahmad Shamieh, a 60-year-old man who arrived in Slovenia in 2015, where he learned the language and became an example of successful refugee integration, has nevertheless become a key dividing line in the country’s politics, whatever the outcome of the impeachment process. Government sources claim the opposition to Cerar’s support of Shamieh is a “staged case” designed to destabilise the government in the run-up to national elections next year. Many tens of thousands of refugees have passed through Slovenia since the refugee crisis began, leading Cerar to claim two years ago that without action to control Europe’s frontiers, the EU would collapse as individual member states took unilateral action. The issue of immigration remains highly controversial in the country. Shamieh’s case took hold of the public imagination when his asylum claim was rejected this summer by the Slovenian courts, which ordered that he should be deported in order to make his application for asylum in Croatia, his first port of call in the EU after leaving Syria. Two prominent MPs, Jan Škoberne, from the leftwing SD party in the coalition government, and Mihe Kordiš, an MP from the leftwing opposition Levica party, took Shamieh to Slovenia’s parliament building to prevent the police from taking him away. When pushed in a press conference last week on his own response to the case, Cerar, who has been prime minister since 2014, suggested that he also wanted to find a way to grant Shamieh residence on the grounds of his integration into Slovenian society. His response prompted claims from rightwingers in the Slovenian parliament that Cerar, a constitutional lawyer, had sought to interfere in the affairs of the independent judiciary. On 15 November the opposition Slovenian Democratic party (SDS), led by Janez Janša, a rightwing former prime minister, announced they would seek to impeach Cerar. Janša, who was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges in 2013, only for the case to be later dismissed by the constitutional court, has previously accused Cerar of being anti-Slovenian, for putting foreigners first. While other eastern European states have boycotted an EU scheme to disperse refugees, Slovenia has taken in 335 people from Greece and Italy out of its EU quota of 567. Cerar has 30 days to answer the charges before a vote in parliament, where the opposition will require a two-thirds majority to carry the motion and force a public court hearing. Only three impeachment motions have been submitted to parliament in the history of the country, founded in 1991 from former Yugoslavia, but none as yet have received a sufficient backing to proceed to the constitutional court. In the course of events, Shamieh has suffered a nervous breakdown and is currently in a psychiatric hospital. He is still expected to be deported to Croatia once he is better, where he will be able to apply to return to Slovenia. Senior Slovenian government sources said, however, that Shamieh’s ill-health may also offer him a right to appeal to the Slovenian court. Slovenian government sources further claimed that the issue had been politicised by both the left and the right to destabilise Cerar’s government in the lead-up to next’s years parliamentary elections. “It is a tragic case,” said one source. “Left and right have used him for their own purposes and the government was squeezed in between. This is a staged affair.”"
2017-08-11T03:09:58Z,Iraqi and Syrian refugees will be settled in Armidale from next year,"The New South Wales regional city of Armidale has volunteered to resettle 200 refugees from Iraq and Syria as part of Australia’s humanitarian migration program next year. The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce announced the move – to his electorate – would begin from February next year. “Armidale is a good fit as a new regional settlement location for humanitarian entrants to Australia,” Joyce said. “It has a strong, welcoming community demonstrated by the fact that this push for the city to be a settlement location for refugees was driven by the community itself. “I have absolutely no doubt that Armidale will work closely with the refugees settling here to ensure they can take up all the opportunities available to those who choose to embrace the great lifestyle available in regional Australia.” Joyce said that many of those settling had endured “unimaginable circumstances which have torn families apart” but that Armidale had the necessary services to support them in integrating in their new country. The overwhelming majority of migrants to Australia – including those who come as refugees – settle in major cities. But refugee resettlement in rural and regional areas has been credited with revitalising country towns socially and economically: in particular places such as Mingoola in northern NSW, which has welcomed three families from Burundi and Congo, and Nhill, which has had more than 160 Karen refugees from Myanmar settle. NSW takes the majority of refugees resettled in Australia, and the bulk of those move to Fairfield City Council in Sydney’s west. That council has said it has struggled to cope with the additional influx of people over the past year. NSW co-ordinator general for refugee resettlement Peter Shergold told a resettlement conference in Sydney that efforts to help settle refugees in rural and regional areas would ease pressure on Fairfield and neighbouring Sydney councils. He said NSW and Australia’s refugee intakes were “eminently manageable”. NSW took more than half of the additional intake of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, in addition to its regular refugee resettlement program. Refugees made up a tiny percentage – 0.14% - of population growth in NSW, Shergold said. “But refugees don’t just distribute across NSW. In this last year, relatively few refugees have gone to Wagga, or Albury or Coffs Harbour, or even to Newcastle or Wollongong. To a very large extent these additional refugees have come to western Sydney… they’ve come to Fairfield. That’s the challenge.” Shergold said the issues facing Fairfield City Council were “acute”, and that a broader spread of resettlement would ease pressure in that area, and, critically, assist refugees in finding employment. “What refugees want is a job. And that has been the most challenging, helping refugees do what they want to do most, which is get employment. “Refugees as a whole bring very significant economic skills... they are risk-takers… they are entrepreneurs. When the ABS does its census it finds the group of Australians most likely to set up family business are people who arrived as refugees.” Shergold welcomed the Armidale announcement, saying the regional city had the necessary infrastructure and support services already in place to help refuges. “This decision has the potential to boost Armidale’s local economy, create new business and most of all, become a template for the kind of Australian mateship the world needs to see.” The new migrants will be housed by Settlement Services International, which is contracted by the Department of Social Services. SSI will also help to find jobs for migrants once they settle in the region."
2017-12-10T03:53:18Z,MPs split as ‘hijacked’ inquiry urges cancellation of young offenders' visas,"Migration benefits Australia economically and socially, however, more English lessons, cultural orientation and community support hubs would help new arrivals and make their settlement easier, a parliamentary inquiry has reported. But, in a disputed recommendation, the inquiry has also called for mandatory cancellation of the visas of migrants, including children, who commit serious crimes. About 190,000 people move to Australia each year under the migration program for skilled and family migrants, split roughly into two-thirds in the skilled streams, and one-third in the family intake. In addition, Australia’s humanitarian migration program accepted 17,555 people in 2015-16. The chairman of the parliamentary joint standing inquiry on migration, Jason Wood, said Australia’s migration program was inarguably a success “and the thousands of people who make their home here each year make a real contribution to society”. “If we are to continue this, we need to focus on early intervention and support programs for new arrivals to make sure they have the best start possible in their new homeland.” Wood, the MP for La Trobe in Melbourne’s east and a former policeman, focused significant attention of the inquiry on the so-called Apex gang, allegedly formed by Sudanese youth, that rose to notoriety in Melbourne after rioting at the Moomba festival in 2016. But Victoria police told the inquiry the gang was a “non-entity” and the majority of its members were born in Australia. Giving evidence, the Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said that, at its peak, the gang consisted of about 130 people loosely affiliated and who came from a broad range of backgrounds. “Predominantly, a large cohort of that gang was, in fact, Australian-born offenders,” he said. Patton said police had “broken the back” of the gang. “We have charged the leaders of that gang and imprisoned them,” he said. “We would call them a non-entity in terms of a gang.” Labor and the Greens criticised the emphasis, saying the entire inquiry had been “hijacked to highlight issues specifically affecting the chair’s own electorate … as such, the report does not reflect the evidence received and ignores the wider context of Australia’s migration situation”. The committee recommended that any visa holder convicted of a crime before a court should be issued with a warning that their ability to become an Australian citizen could be jeopardised by further offending. The committee also recommended that the migration act be amended to mandate the cancellation of the visa of young offenders – aged between 16 and 18 – convicted of a serious violent offence, such a car-jacking or serious assault. “We need to make it clear to those who commit serious and violent crimes that their actions will have consequences,” Wood said, “whether it’s a community protection intervention order, forfeiting eligibility for citizenship or even deportation.” But this recommendation was opposed by Labor and the Greens. Labor argued it “does not objectively reflect the evidence… ignores crucial contextual details and places an undue emphasis on others”, while the Greens said the entire inquiry sought to “demonise particular groups of new migrants”. The committee also recommended broadening and strengthening the scope of section 501 of the migration act, the section used to cancel the visas of people who commit serious crimes in Australia or who, in the view of the minister, fail the “character test” to stay in Australia. The use of section 501 to cancel visas on character grounds has grown exponentially in the past four years, increasing more than tenfold to 1,284 last year. This recommendation was also opposed by non-government committee members. Recommendations from the committee’s report that attracted unanimous support included allowing all migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds access to the government-funded adult migrant English program (Amep) of 510 hours of English lessons and giving migrants longer to enrol, and longer to complete their classes. “Amep’s services need to be more flexible in order to meet the needs of migrants from diverse backgrounds and circumstances,” the report said. “This can be done, in part, by adjusting and extending the eligibility requirements of the Amep, which will improve English language outcomes for migrants.” The inquiry said the community hubs program – 57 hubs are operating across the country – that provides support to newly arrived migrants and other initiatives such as the neighbourhood migrants mothers’ outreach program should be given extra federal government funding. Community hubs improved English skills and child literacy, the inquiry heard, and “also made migrants feel more connected to their community and school and increased their knowledge of community services”."

2017-11-22T07:00:13Z,"'Shocking' political rhetoric on refugees aims to poison debate, UN official warns","The language used to describe people caught up in the migration crisis has been attacked by a special representative of the UN as “deliberately invidious” and aimed at poisoning public debate. Using terms such as “illegal” rather than “irregular” migrants, or “hordes, waves and swarms” rather than simply “large numbers”, conveniently obscures the vulnerabilities that come from being a foreigner, said Louise Arbour, the UN secretary general’s special representative for international migration. Giving a speech at the Overseas Development Institute in London, before member state negotiations on the first global compact on migration, Arbour said it was “quite shocking to see how use of language in an invidious way has poisoned the debate”. British politicians were accused of using racist language about migrants and migration during last year’s referendum on leaving the EU, while former prime minister David Cameron provoked international condemnation when he described migrants in Calais as a “swarm”. In the US, Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has gone even further. Two years ago, he claimed Mexican immigrants were rapists, drug dealers and criminals, a view recently countered by the acting director on immigration and customs, Thomas Homan, who said undocumented immigrants do not commit more crimes than native-born Americans. Arbour, a former UN high commissioner for human rights and former chief prosecutor of war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, said she believed 2017 had brought the “beginning of a change of narrative” on migration. “In this field, as in many others nowadays, reality is much better than perception,” she said. But she criticised “political decision-makers” who were “not particularly well informed” about important, positive aspects of migration, in particular remittances sent home by migrants working overseas. Remittances compete with foreign aid as one of the largest financial inflows to developing countries. “Outside informed circles … knowledge about the impact of remittances, for instance, is often limited,” she said. Politicians often did not know that remittances amounted to more than 20% of GDP in some countries, she said. Neither did they know that in 2016, migrants contributed $429bn (£325bn) in remittances to developing countries – a sum that represented more than three times the total official development assistance. They often had no idea, she went on, that the cost of money transfers could be reduced from 7.5% to 3%, that the UN had promised to achieve that, or what the impact would be of such an achievement on developing countries. “This is something that political decision-makers should be right on top of,” she said. “But I believe this is now starting to be good news. Because this reality, among others, brings the conversations about migration to much better place. In making sound policy, the foundations have to be fact, not perception, fiction myths and stereotypes. “Migration is here to stay and, in absolute numbers, it’s here to grow – and it has to be in everybody’s interest that human mobility is better managed than it is today.” Negotiations on the global compact on safe, regular and orderly migration, one of two compacts agreed by member states as part of the New York declaration in 2016, will start early next year, and should be agreed by July. It is set to be adopted an intergovernmental conference in December 2018."
2017-12-17T23:27:56Z,Refugee advocates blockade Melbourne port in protest at offshore detention,"Protesters have blockaded Melbourne’s container port in opposition to Australia’s offshore immigration detention regime. The port – Australia’s busiest – was blockaded at three entrances on Monday morning, with protesters blocking road entrances and unveiling a banner that read: “All refugees in detention are political prisoners.” Three climbers suspended themselves above three road entrances to the port and refused to come down. “Today we are taking action against Australia’s border policy, which remains open to corporate profits, yet is violently closed to those seeking safety,” said SOS Manus spokeswoman Charlotte Lynch. “We support the calls made by refugees and ex-detainees for international sanctions to be placed on Australia until the people on Manus are free.” The protest has caused significant traffic delays around the port. Victoria police are at the site. A spokeswoman for Victoria police said there would be a police presence at the rally to maintain public safety. “People have every right to protest. However, we ask that they do so peacefully and without impacting on the rest of the community,” she said. “Police will be monitoring the rally to ensure there are no breaches of the peace or crimes occurring.” The deal to resettle refugees from Australian detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru in the United States is progressing on both sides. Close to 200 refugees – about 60 from Manus and 130 from Nauru – will move to the US in January. Fifty-four refugees were moved in September. But the newly reinstated travel ban imposed by the US president, Donald Trump, excludes people of certain nationalities, including Iranians and Somalis, from resettlement. Iranians are the largest national group on both Manus and Nauru. The US could take up to 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore camps – not enough to clear them – but it’s unclear precisely how many it will ultimately accept. Australia’s return obligation – to take central American refugees from refugee camps in Costa Rica – has also begun. Thirty people from seven families have moved to Australia after several months of assessment by the immigration department. It is understood they fled gang-related violence in El Salvador and had been living in hiding before being transferred to Costa Rica. The number of refugees fleeing criminal violence in the “northern triangle” countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has escalated in recent years: nearly 10% of the 30 million people who live in those countries have fled across borders because of extortion, rape and forced gang recruitment after decades of civil war and conflict. Most of those displaced are fleeing north towards Mexico and the US. The US runs refugee camps in Costa Rica and has brokered assistance in resettling people from there. The US refugee deal was agreed between the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and former US president Barack Obama in November 2016. Trump has described the arrangement as a “dumb deal” and lambasted Turnbull over it during a fractious phone call in January. His administration, however, has insisted the deal will be upheld."
2017-07-04T19:01:48Z,The Guardian view on the return of the migrant boats: Europe’s problem | Editorial,"High summer is migrant season in the Mediterranean. In rising numbers, men, women and children set off in the flimsiest of craft for Italy. So far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration, at least 2,000 people have drowned in the attempt. This is made all the worse by the equivocation and even the hostility of EU states which make little show of solidarity; today Austria announced it was ready to send troops and tanks to stop migrants crossing the border from Italy. The Mediterranean is already the world’s worst maritime cemetery. Italy, which finds itself on the receiving end of this migration, urgently needs more European support than is currently on offer. Lest anyone doubt it, this applies to the UK government too: last year, only 13,000 asylum claims were granted. The numbers are not as staggering as they were, but this year’s migration crisis is no less tragic and no less diplomatically fraught. The number entering Europe by sea so far is 100,000, half last year’s number for the same period. Four-fifths of them arrived in Italy. Migrant centres are overwhelmed. The Italian government says the situation is “unbearable”. Last week it threatened to close its ports to ships used by NGOs to rescue migrants. It wants other coastline states – Spain and France – to offer points of arrival. A flurry of EU meetings – with another one due on Thursday in Tallinn – has so far produced little concrete help, while a proposed EU “code of conduct” for NGOs risks limiting their action. NGOs are furious that their humanitarian work has been described as creating a “pull factor”: they say that is finger-pointing rather than tackling the real issues. It is to Italy’s credit that, in 2013, it became the first European country to launch a life-saving operation, Mare Nostrum. Since then, search and rescue operations have been internationalised. But little has been done to make the welcoming effort a genuinely Europe-wide one. Refugee relocation plans have been more of a concept than a reality. To date, an EU plan originally intended for tens of thousands has led to the resettlement of only 7,354 people from Italy. Yet, although Italy’s frustration is understandable, blocking humanitarian ships cannot be the right answer. There are more sustainable solutions. It is lack of political will that makes them unattainable. EU migration policies need to be overhauled. Fear of a populist backlash leaves governments wary of creating the safe, legal routes that would allow an orderly processing of asylum claims. Not all migrants are entitled to asylum, but all asylum claims must be fairly examined. Crisis management that centres on border control, even if it is pushed back to Libya’s southern borders, is not enough. Outsourcing the problem to Libya’s coastguards or militias only makes it worse. The UNHCR says there is “no slowing down” of migrant movements to Libya. That is likely to mean ever larger numbers trying to travel the central Mediterranean route to Europe. Last year’s EU-Turkey agreement managed to stem migrant and refugee movements across the Aegean Sea, but to a large extent it has only displaced the problem. It is no surprise that Libya, a country of three competing governments, plunged in internal chaos, has become a network of ruthless and sometimes murderous traffickers, and the new flashpoint. The mounting concerns of the centre-left government in Rome may not be motivated only by human tragedy, but also by the fear that uncontrolled migration will help either the far right or the Five Star movement make gains in the coming elections. Europe has a collective interest in thwarting such an outcome, just as it does in upholding its commitment to the principle of asylum. That can only be done through coordination across the EU. Migration is a long-term problem. But with the so-called summer season under way, pledges of solidarity must urgently be translated into action. Italy’s problems are not only Italian but European too."
2017-12-13T15:41:58Z,Artist hangs refugees' clothing in London church to highlight crisis,"A baby’s bright red bib emblazoned with the words “My 1st Christmas Ever!” Pyjama tops with sleeve ends intertwined like holding hands. A pair of jeans upside down as though their owner is falling from a height. Shoes, socks, mittens, hats. A long, winding, blue patterned scarf. These are among 700 items of refugees’ clothing salvaged from beaches and olive groves on the Greek island of Lesbos and hung in an installation by the British war artist Arabella Dorman in the nave of St James’s church in Piccadilly, London. Dorman has called her artwork Suspended, reflecting both the powerful and poignant display of clothing and the state of limbo experienced by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and misery. Dorman first visited Lesbos in 2015, after earlier spending time on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. “But nothing compared me for the human drama on those beaches. It was so shocking to see the level of trauma, especially among children, the innocents caught up in war,” she said. “There were thousands of items of clothing discarded by refugees. I was struck by the concept of the empty garment, evoking the hidden presence of the person who had worn that item. These clothes reveal what is now being forgotten.” Two years ago, the image of the body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy, on a beach in Turkey focused global opinion on the plight of refugees. Now, said Dorman, “there is a deepening and worsening crisis but it no longer occupies news headlines. People find it easy to turn away and forget – partly because they feel so helpless.” Suspended aims to bring the refugee crisis back into focus, particularly around Christmas, and to raise funds for the Starfish Foundation, a charity helping refugees. “Christmas can very easily be bankrupt of meaning,” said the Rev Lucy Winkett, the rector of St James’s. “So as a church we’re saying there’s no better time to talk about this big issue. “Christmas is a story of a child born into danger, it’s a story of perilous journeys, fleeing persecution and violence, rootlessness. So when you see the children’s clothes, baby clothes [in the installation], the link with the Christmas story is absolutely undeniable.” The Labour peer Alf Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, said it was impossible not to be moved by Suspended. “Every one of these items of clothing represents a life, it’s very poignant.” He called on the government to honour its commitment under the Dubs amendment to provide safe passage to the UK for 480 unaccompanied minors living in refugee camps. To date, 202 children have been brought to the UK, including two from Greece this week. “It’s critical that we hold the government to account and ensure that we don’t close the door now to children seeking sanctuary in our country,” Lord Dubs said. “Every child that comes is a victory – it gives that child the chance of a decent life.” Brexit had “set the clock back”, he added. “It’s taken all the headlines and most of the energy of government ministers. The public has a short memory. So it’s really important that faith organisations have been so solid on this issue.” Dorman said she had been “ruminating on this project for two years – it’s been a slow burn”. She shipped 1,400 items of clothing in 27 boxes from Lesbos, and then selected those she felt told the most moving stories. All had to be dry-cleaned and made fire-retardent. “I’ve tried to convey the chaos, the explosion of people’s lives. It’s about the fragility and vulnerability of human beings,” she said. In 2015, St James’s hosted an earlier art installation by Dorman, Flight, which featured a refugee boat salvaged from Greece and hung in the church’s nave. “It’s not the church’s job to write immigration policy, but it is our job to speak up for people who are suffering,” said Winkett. “So I don’t mind at all being political with a small p. We’re saying the government should take the Dubs children.” Suspended will be on display until 8 February."
2017-08-20T19:01:12Z,Solidarity must extend far beyond the victims of terror | Editorial,"Spain has been a model of solidarity in the three days since the terror attacks that killed 14 people in Barcelona and Cabrils. That number is now known to include the seven-year-old Julian Cadman, who had dual British-Australian nationality and whose engaging image has been on front pages. He had been missing since the savage vehicle attack on Thursday afternoon. On Sunday morning the king and queen led the mourners at a service in La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona’s basilica, which, perhaps paradoxically in the circumstances, was conceived by Antoni Gaudí as a paeon to faith and nationalism. More than 1,500 people packed the church, while nearby Las Ramblas continued to be a focus for grief and resistance. But behind the solidarity, Spain’s national cohesion faces more stresses than in most European countries. At least eight of the terrorists appear to have grown up in one small town, Ripoll. Their horrified families are blaming Abdelbaki Es Satty, the imam of one of the town’s mosques, for radicalising their sons. The small community, where one in 10 residents is a migrant, is in a state of shock to discover that football-loving kids who appeared entirely comfortable with their Spanish identity set out on such a murderous course. Police, who are investigating what they now say was a plot to launch a huge terror attack, are trying to establish whether the imam died in a gas explosion that destroyed a house last Wednesday. Yet this is a region that is uncomfortably familiar with conflicts of identity. Catalonia’s president, Carles Puigdemont, attended the Sunday service with the king and queen, but it was a rare joint appearance with the monarchs for the republican politician, who is the architect of the unofficial referendum on independence that is scheduled to take place in less than six weeks’ time. Madrid continues to insist the plebiscite is illegal and that it will do everything it can to stop it happening. The last Catalan president who organised a similar referendum has been banned from public office for two years. Thursday’s attack is likely to be used by Madrid to add to the pressure on the regional government. The argument has already been rehearsed in the national capital’s newspaper El País, which said it was a wake-up call for the Catalan government, described independence as a fantasy and called on the regional politicians to “ditch the democratic nonsense … and start working for our real interests”. There are plenty of people, not just in the darker corners of social media, who believe there is a link between terror and refugees. Late last year, Europol reported Islamic State was deliberately trying to radicalise vulnerable refugees in order to inflame the migration crisis and turn EU citizens against refugees seeking asylum. That makes the challenge Barcelona faces now, to sustain the qualities of a multicultural cosmopolitanism, the youthful and open approach that has made it so beloved, the more important. It has a fine record: its recent hostility to rapidly growing tourism, partly aggravated by the way Airbnb has driven up rents in the city, is more than matched – as banners during anti-tourism protests showed – by its readiness to welcome refugees. It describes itself as a “refugee city” and it has an impressive plan for comprehensive reception and resettlement facilities. But Barcelona’s offer of welcome is not shared absolutely everywhere in Spain, and, last week, the UN refugee agency warned the country was struggling to cope with the 9,300 refugees who have already arrived this year. That number will only increase as the route from Libya becomes ever more dangerous and some of the tens of thousands who risk the crossing to Italy seek a safer route. The past year has seen terror strike half a dozen European countries. Events in Spain were still unfolding when a man went on the rampage in the Finnish town of Turku, murdering two women. His ethnicity, like that of the Spanish terrorists, was Moroccan. These brutal murders have played a part in poisoning the atmosphere against migrants. While Angela Merkel of Germany stoutly upholds her commitment to refugees, the EU collectively has failed at every turn, unable even to ensure that members honour the commitments they have already made to ease the burden on the frontline states of Greece and Italy. This is a desperate tragedy for millions fleeing endemic violence and insecurity. It threatens, too, the precious cohesion of neighbourhoods. And it is a kind of victory for the terrorists of all sides who seek to undermine Europe’s universal values. • This article was amended on 22 August 2017.

2017-12-09T08:00:01Z,Perfect match: website gives academic refugees chance to connect,"When a record number of asylum seekers and refugees arrived in Germany two years ago, Carmen Bachmann was one of many in the country who felt compelled to help the newcomers settle in. She did not rush down to greet them with welcome signs or pledge to volunteer at refugee camps. Instead Bachmann, 41, a Leipzig University professor, turned into something of a matchmaker. She created a website, Chance for Science, to connect refugee academics with German counterparts across a broad range of disciplines. The site uses the template of a dating service and allows users to register as a refugee academic or a German professor or researcher, stating their location and field of study, so people can be matched together with others doing similar work. There are now 720 registered users, including 224 refugees. The links made via the website could lead to a job, although Bachmann said that was not the main aim. “The primary thinking is to encourage work collaboration, the sharing of ideas or to help refugee scientists gain access to the latest research. Alongside it, we have also been running educational workshops for the past year with government funding. They help newcomers understand how the German academic system works,” she said. “We also want to make people feel like they are staying in touch with the academic world. Being an academic is part of their identity and when refugees come here they lose that. It is important for them to be in an environment where they can be a specialist again and people recognise them as such. People can come together and share ideas, discuss and create networks.” As a result of the project, Bachmann is now working with Günay Karli, 45, a computer scientist who specialises in artificial intelligence. He worked at Fatih University in Turkey before it was one of several institutions closed down by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, over alleged links to the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen and an attempted political coup. Karli, who arrived in Germany from Bosnia three months ago, said: “I was surprised to hear about the project because it is so selfless … This project is important for refugees because we do not have anything related to our academic fields or system. We don’t know anyone who knows how things work and we have a desire to continue our research, learn and to share ideas.” Bachmann and Karli are working together on taxation. One aspect they are looking at is whether it is possible to predict the future performance of a company and its key performance indicator (KPI) by analysing social media. Karli is helping with data analysis and using computer software. While Karli waits to hear the result of his asylum application, he is happy to continue doing academic work. Although he cannot take paid employment, everything he does will be useful for his portfolio of work. “I am a refugee but this is only a small part of who I am. I am also still an academic,” he said. “No matter what situation I find myself in I have to continue with my research still. We cannot stop our brains from working.” Bachmann and her small team recently held a conference, Academics on the Flight, where eight refugees spoke on stage about their work and others presented posters. “Lots of the refugees have no affiliations any more and Chance for Science is an intermediate affiliation, so people feel they can belong to something, even if their home university does not exist any more,” she said. Bachmann got a year’s worth of money from the government to run the workshops and conference but it runs out in December. “I would like more funding as it has become a second full-time job for me … I need support because there is lots of potential in this idea and it is growing fast. It could also work for other professions.” She said the biggest challenge of the project had been overcoming the bureaucracy of the German system. “I did not ask permission from anyone to set up the website, just the president of the university, because it would have taken too long to do it officially. These are people who would have nothing to do and I wanted to start it quickly.” Her inspiration came from a chance meeting with an academic at a refugee camp. “I met a man and all he had with him was his diploma. He was so happy someone was paying attention to it because, understandably, the volunteers there were just making sure everyone had shelter and food. “From that moment it became very personal for me and it helped me realise what being an academic is. I have learned just as much from this process as those I have been helping.”"
2017-12-13T15:41:58Z,Artist hangs refugees' clothing in London church to highlight crisis,"A baby’s bright red bib emblazoned with the words “My 1st Christmas Ever!” Pyjama tops with sleeve ends intertwined like holding hands. A pair of jeans upside down as though their owner is falling from a height. Shoes, socks, mittens, hats. A long, winding, blue patterned scarf. These are among 700 items of refugees’ clothing salvaged from beaches and olive groves on the Greek island of Lesbos and hung in an installation by the British war artist Arabella Dorman in the nave of St James’s church in Piccadilly, London. Dorman has called her artwork Suspended, reflecting both the powerful and poignant display of clothing and the state of limbo experienced by hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and misery. Dorman first visited Lesbos in 2015, after earlier spending time on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. “But nothing compared me for the human drama on those beaches. It was so shocking to see the level of trauma, especially among children, the innocents caught up in war,” she said. “There were thousands of items of clothing discarded by refugees. I was struck by the concept of the empty garment, evoking the hidden presence of the person who had worn that item. These clothes reveal what is now being forgotten.” Two years ago, the image of the body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy, on a beach in Turkey focused global opinion on the plight of refugees. Now, said Dorman, “there is a deepening and worsening crisis but it no longer occupies news headlines. People find it easy to turn away and forget – partly because they feel so helpless.” Suspended aims to bring the refugee crisis back into focus, particularly around Christmas, and to raise funds for the Starfish Foundation, a charity helping refugees. “Christmas can very easily be bankrupt of meaning,” said the Rev Lucy Winkett, the rector of St James’s. “So as a church we’re saying there’s no better time to talk about this big issue. “Christmas is a story of a child born into danger, it’s a story of perilous journeys, fleeing persecution and violence, rootlessness. So when you see the children’s clothes, baby clothes [in the installation], the link with the Christmas story is absolutely undeniable.” The Labour peer Alf Dubs, who arrived in Britain as a child refugee on the Kindertransport, said it was impossible not to be moved by Suspended. “Every one of these items of clothing represents a life, it’s very poignant.” He called on the government to honour its commitment under the Dubs amendment to provide safe passage to the UK for 480 unaccompanied minors living in refugee camps. To date, 202 children have been brought to the UK, including two from Greece this week. “It’s critical that we hold the government to account and ensure that we don’t close the door now to children seeking sanctuary in our country,” Lord Dubs said. “Every child that comes is a victory – it gives that child the chance of a decent life.” Brexit had “set the clock back”, he added. “It’s taken all the headlines and most of the energy of government ministers. The public has a short memory. So it’s really important that faith organisations have been so solid on this issue.” Dorman said she had been “ruminating on this project for two years – it’s been a slow burn”. She shipped 1,400 items of clothing in 27 boxes from Lesbos, and then selected those she felt told the most moving stories. All had to be dry-cleaned and made fire-retardent. “I’ve tried to convey the chaos, the explosion of people’s lives. It’s about the fragility and vulnerability of human beings,” she said. In 2015, St James’s hosted an earlier art installation by Dorman, Flight, which featured a refugee boat salvaged from Greece and hung in the church’s nave. “It’s not the church’s job to write immigration policy, but it is our job to speak up for people who are suffering,” said Winkett. “So I don’t mind at all being political with a small p. We’re saying the government should take the Dubs children.” Suspended will be on display until 8 February."
2017-11-10T08:43:00Z,Tony Abbott fundraiser surrounded by pro-refugee protesters,"Hundreds of pro-refugee protesters have surrounded a fundraising event for former prime minister Tony Abbott in Sydney and heckled attendees. A vocal crowd of about 200 wrestled with police as they attempted block cars with guests entering the event in Redfern. They confronted guests, including Abbott’s sister Christine Forster. She was forced back from the entrance to the event before police formed a ring around her and pushed their way through the crowd. Protesters shouted “Refugees are welcome here” and “Shame on you” to event attendees as bands played in the background. The protest is being held to oppose Australia’s offshore detention system, with immigration minister Peter Dutton attending the fundraiser. In Melbourne on Friday evening, more than 1,000 protesters supporting the plight of refugees on Manus Island brought the CBD to a standstill. The demonstration, which set off from the State Library, caused major delays for trams and cars as protesters move through the city down Swanston Street. Dozens of police, including some on horseback, lined the street to prevent the rally from heading towards the city’s busiest intersection outside Flinders Street station. Police earlier said they were aware of the planned action, adding they respected the rights of protesters but “will not tolerate people breaking the law or endangering the safety of the community”. On Friday, Papua New Guinean immigration officials and police started destroying makeshift shelters built by about 600 refugees and asylum seekers who refuse to relocate from the now closed Manus Island detention centre. They also destroyed the rubbish bins that were used to store water. The initial efforts to dismantle the camp started on Friday, a day before a slated deadline for forcible removal that Prime Minister Peter O’Neill warned of on Thursday. Almost 60 refugees and asylum seekers had already voluntarily boarded buses and trucks to be taken to new accommodation on Friday as a result of the operation, said Police Chief Superintendent Dominic Kakas."
2017-10-02T07:25:36Z,"'Young migrants in Ireland are treated as children, not asylum seekers'","When the first group of unaccompanied child migrants arrived in Ireland from the Calais refugee camp earlier this year, their progress through Dublin airport was impeded by well-wishers who wanted the youngsters to know they were welcome. “I vividly remember not one but two elderly Irish gentlemen, 10 minutes apart, who each insisted we tell the kids they were really glad they were here,” says Thomas Dunning, principal social worker with the team for separated children seeking asylum at Tusla, Ireland’s child and family agency. “That reflects the marked change in feeling we’ve seen in the past 12 months.” Last November, the Irish parliament responded to public clamour by making an all-party commitment to accept up to 200 children who’d been living in the (by-then dismantled) Calais camp. Extra resources were promised for Tusla, which oversees a well-established programme for child migrants that is regarded as a model of good practice around the world. In late October, the Irish programme will be one of the approaches discussed at a conference in Stockholm, organised by the European Social Network, on meeting the needs of migrant children and young people. Sweden has been dealing with some of the largest numbers of child refugees, receiving more than 35,000 in 2015 alone. “Our numbers are small by comparison – we had 126 last year,” says Dunning. “But we are proud of what we do and we have a ‘child first’ ethos – they are treated as a child, not an asylum seeker – and an equity of care principle that’s almost unique in Europe.” This principle guarantees that child migrants are given the same level of care and support as Irish children in the care system. It was introduced in 2009 after providers had been overwhelmed by the numbers of unaccompanied young people arriving in the early years of the decade – a peak of 1,085 in 2001 – and resorted to accommodating them in dormitory-style hostels. The last hostel was shut in 2010 and migrant children are now placed in foster care or small children’s homes, each accommodating no more than six. The child will enter the asylum process “if and when appropriate”, sponsored by the social worker assigned to them on arrival in loco parentis. The social worker accompanies them through the process even if they turn 18 and legally become an adult. The number of child migrants arriving in Ireland is growing again, including those being admitted from shelters in Greece via the European resettlement scheme. The UK has reportedly taken none from Greece this year, citing procedural difficulties. Dunning, himself a migrant from the US, is confident that Ireland can deal with the rising numbers. “I feel we are ready for it,” he says. “I can go and say, ‘I need this Irish child to get that, and this child from Ghana needs to have it too’. I am listened to and the resources are put in place.” Dunning’s team of 17 at Tusla is complemented by a separate, 11-strong children’s service at the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (ETB), which is led by manager Jessica Farnan, who will be speaking at the Stockholm conference. On arrival, children go straight into a programme designed to prepare them for mainstream schooling. The programme was first envisaged to last six weeks, but low education levels among the current wave of young migrants – and typically limited English – means they usually need longer preparation, sometimes a year or more. “In some cases they have little by way of reading or writing skills in their own language and we are really starting from scratch,” says Farnan. “It can be a case of ‘learning to learn’. Those who have been in Calais may have to learn how to go to school and how to get up in the morning.” Most arrivals from France are boys, originally from Afghanistan or Somalia. Their needs may be quite different to those coming from Syria via Greece, says Farnan. “The ETB first researched the needs of unaccompanied minors 15 or so years ago, but we have changed what we do as the system has changed. We carry on doing that.” Join the Social Care Network for comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox. Follow us on Twitter (@GdnSocialCare) and like us on Facebook.

2017-11-02T06:01:47Z,Climate change 'will create world's biggest refugee crisis',"Tens of millions of people will be forced from their homes by climate change in the next decade, creating the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen, according to a new report. Senior US military and security experts have told the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) study that the number of climate refugees will dwarf those that have fled the Syrian conflict, bringing huge challenges to Europe. “If Europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years,” said retired US military corps brigadier general Stephen Cheney. “See what happens when climate change drives people out of Africa – the Sahel [sub-Saharan area] especially – and we’re talking now not just one or two million, but 10 or 20 [million]. They are not going to south Africa, they are going across the Mediterranean.” The study published on Thursday calls on governments to agree a new legal framework to protect climate refugees and, ahead of next week’s climate summit in Germany, urges leaders to do more to implement the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement. Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, told the EJF: “What we are talking about here is an existential threat to our civilisation in the longer term. In the short term, it carries all sorts of risks as well and it requires a human response on a scale that has never been achieved before.” The report argues that climate change played a part in the build up to the Syrian war, with successive droughts causing 1.5 million people to migrate to the country’s cities between 2006 and 2011. Many of these people then had no reliable access to food, water or jobs. “Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences,” said EJF executive director, Steve Trent. “In our rapidly changing world climate change – and its potential to trigger both violent conflict and mass migration – needs to be considered as an urgent priority for policymakers and business leaders alike.” Although the report highlights to growing impact of climate change on people in the Middle East and Africa, it says changing weather patterns – like the hurricanes that devastated parts of the US this year – prove richer nations are not immune from climate change. But Trent said that although climate change undoubtedly posed an “existential threat to our world” it was not to late to take decisive action. “By taking strong ambitious steps now to phase out greenhouse gas emissions and building an international legal mechanism to protect climate refugees we will protect the poorest and most vulnerable in our global society, build resilience, reap massive economic benefits and build a safe and secure future for our planet. Climate change will not wait. Neither can we. For climate refugees, tomorrow is too late.”"

2017-11-04T01:27:39Z,UN attacks Australia's 'inhumane' refugee-processing system,"The United Nations human rights commission has denounced the Australian government for withdrawing support to former Manus Island detainees as the stand-off over the provision of services to more than 600 men enters its fifth day. It comes as detainees on Nauru call for an investigation into the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker, who was killed in a road accident on the island nation on Thursday. In a statement, Rupert Colville, spokesman for high commissioner Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, said the UN’s human rights committee had “serious concerns about the welfare, safety and wellbeing” of the men who remained at the centre in Papua New Guinea, which was formally decommissioned on Tuesday. Water to the centre and essential medical services were also cut off on Tuesday, while electricity was disconnected on Wednesday morning. The men have been digging for water. Colville said the men were “too frightened to leave”. “We call on the Australian government, as the party who interned the men in the first place, to immediately provide protection, food, water and other basic services which have been cut off since authorities shuttered the facility on 31 October,” he said. The commission repeated its criticism that Australia’s offshore refugee processing regime was “unsustainable, inhumane and contrary to its human rights obligations” and said asylum seekers and refugees should be immediately transferred to Australia for processing. Rallies in support of the Manus refugees were held in Canberra and Brisbane on Friday and planned for Melbourne and Sydney on Saturday. Colville said Australia and PNG had responsibilities under the 1951 Refugee Convention to protect and provide for the men. “The men have said they fear they will be subjected to violence at the hands of locals if they leave the compound – and, given there have been violent incidents in the past, we believe these fears should be respected and satisfactorily addressed,” he said. ‘All migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, are human beings. Like all of us, they have a right to a safe and secure environment, a right to an adequate standard of living and to participate in the decision-making process that is affecting their future. “Human dignity should be ensured throughout the entire processing of their asylum claims. We urge the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea to fully respect their human rights, including their specific rights under international refugee law, and to enter into a dialogue with the men to ensure these rights are duly respected, protected and fulfilled.” The Australian government has rejected claims it abandoned the detainees, saying water, power and medical services are available at three alternative accommodation facilities that can be “accessed at any time,” and that comfortable and secure transport to take them to those facilities is also “standing by”. The government has not addressed a report made by the UN high commissioner for refugees, which inspected the alternative accommodation this week and said one of the units was not ready for occupation. On Nauru, police reportedly arrested a man connected to a fatal crash that resulted in the death of a 29-year-old asylum seeker from Bangladesh, but detainees at the Nauru regional processing centre were concerned about the circumstances of the accident. The man, who has been in Nauru for more than three years, died in a collision between the motorcycle he was riding and another vehicle on the road to Fly Camp, the detention centre for single men, about 2pm local time on Thursday. Guardian Australia has attempted to contact the Nauruan government and the Australian immigration department to confirm the arrest. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul has called for a full investigation to determine the circumstances of the crash. “There is a lot of suspicion about what has happened,” Rintoul told Guardian Australia. “The fact that refugees are routinely hated just heightens their concerns even more.” The government of Nauru released a statement on Thursday saying “reports on social media alleging this was more than an accident are false”. “Police are investigating the accident and no other details are yet available,” the statement said. “The Government of Nauru extends its sincere sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased.” On Friday, opposition leader Bill Shorten urged prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to accept a renewed offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore processing camps, saying it was similar to the US resettlement deal brokered with former US president Barack Obama. Australia rejected the offer when it was first made by former New Zealand prime minister John Key in 2013, saying people smugglers would see it as a way to provide backdoor entry to Australia. Turnbull is scheduled to meet New Zealand’s new prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, this weekend."
2017-11-20T04:59:51Z,Making the no vote about migrants ignores a fundamental thing | Naaman Zhou,"Within minutes of last Wednesday’s historic yes vote for marriage equality, the narrative was about western Sydney. Twelve electorates there recorded a majority no vote. Some, like Greenway, did so by a bare 53%, but others like Blaxland, held by Labor’s Jason Clare, hit 75% – the highest in the country. The finger was quickly pointed at the multicultural community, with these electorates having a higher-than-average, but by no means astronomical, proportion of residents from non-English speaking backgrounds. The link between migrants and the no vote – which is fairly flimsy mathematically – has been handled as though it were gospel truth. The result has been pitched as some kind of crisis in progressive politics: a brewing clash between racial tolerance and LGBTI rights, where only one can win. But this analysis ignores a pretty fundamental thing about statistics and about people. They change. Poll western Sydney again in six months and opposition will be down. Poll Australia once it has lived under legalised marriage equality and opposition will be down. I’ll bet my bottom dollar. The no campaign spoke the language of hypotheticals and nightmares. They targeted migrant communities and said same-sex unions would ruin existing marriages. That small business owners would be prosecuted by litigious gay couples demanding cakes. That you simply could not know what would happen. Once people realise same-sex marriage hasn’t ruined their lives, once they see the joy it brings to friends and family with no detriment to others, opposition will naturally drop. I don’t expect a backlash, I expect acceptance. This isn’t blue-sky, optimistic thinking – it’s a process that happens to any law or policy. We seem to have forgotten how opinion polls work. If you survey the nation in November about an unenacted law, then ask again once people have lived under it, minds will have changed. Across Australia – among the multicultural communities, the religious, and those who voted no but had the good fortune to be Anglo-Saxon or middle-class enough to not be immediately made the talking point – acceptance of marriage equality will come sooner than we think. The idea that these 12 electorates were the sole stronghold of the no vote is obviously artificial, and just bad maths. The opposition to marriage equality was high on the government benches. The opposition among One Nation candidates is well above the 75% in Blaxland. So why are we picking on the multicultural community? Statistics show that the factor most correlated with voting no was religion, not overseas birth. People have conveniently ignored that some of Australia’s most multicultural electorates, such as Wills in Victoria, Moreton in Brisbane, and Sydney’s Grayndler, Kingsford Smith and Bradfield all registered yes votes over 60%. It’s also demographically wrong to treat western Sydney as though it is purely non-white. Put bluntly, Anglo-Australians voted no too. The Anglican church gave the no campaign $1m. Homophobia in migrant communities is of course an important, worthwhile and entrenched issue – but it is much too complex for this blunt instrument of a survey. A discussion should be had, but not one based on a six-week poll pushed through the post and buffeted by a campaign of deliberate uncertainty. Some say the yes campaign should have worked harder in western Sydney. That may be true, but it shouldn’t be seen as some great moral failing, nor should it affect the legitimacy of the yes win. When Malcolm Turnbull won the 2016 election on a one-seat majority, no one pointed to the 74 electorates that registered a majority no vote against him. But if yes were a political party, it would have won 133 seats out of 150. There are millions and millions of multicultural Australians who voted yes – my queer friends, myself, my mum, my grandmother. It speaks of an insane double standard we push onto marginalised communities – not only do they have to win, they have to win a majority in every seat and in every mind. It’s not enough that the multicultural community voted, with the rest of Australia, overwhelmingly for marriage equality, if a few supposedly “ethnic” electorates did not. Those who push this multiculturalism against LGBTI rights angle are creating an exaggerated conflict between tolerances and are rarely on the side of either. Ethnic Australians are not a static, unthinking monolith. They are humans who listen to their children and grandchildren. Who can recognise joy and love when they see it. Who can change their minds. Some won’t – but that happens everywhere, not just in western Sydney. Opinion polls and elections divide communities. It’s what they are designed to do. But the one constant across history is that tolerance is a fairly universal language –maybe the message got lost this time, or maybe the case wasn’t made properly. Maybe it wasn’t listened to. But it will be. Naaman Zhou is a reporter for Guardian Australia"
2017-11-08T20:54:13Z,Greens unveil plan for diversity targets and multicultural commission,"The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has released a proposal to strengthen multiculturalism in Australia, including an independent multicultural commission and diversity targets in government departments. Di Natale will release draft legislation on Thursday that proposes making government departments and agencies publicly report on diversity within their organisations. The draft plan also includes the establishment of an independent multicultural commission, and is aimed at strengthening protection for culturally and linguistically diverse communities and promoting multiculturalism. It comes after proposed legislation to overhaul citizenship laws and make it harder for migrants to become Australian citizens was struck down by the Senate last month, amid concerns that legislation unfairly targeted those with English as a second language. Di Natale will address the Migration Institute of Australia conference in Melbourne on Thursday to map out his party’s proposed reforms. A draft of his speech, obtained by Guardian Australia, says the government was failing to give migrants certainty about their status or make them feel welcome. “The proposed changes to the citizenship laws can only be described as another attack on migrants,” Di Natale’s speech will say. “They required university level English and an increased wait of four additional years to apply for citizenship. This is a government where deterrence is at the heart of our refugee policy. “It relies on conditions being as bad as the conditions people are fleeing. And it harms the innocent to send a message. Since 31 October, 600 men on Manus have been left to fend for themselves. The lives of these men are in serious danger and the new facilities are not fit for human habitation. They are being denied medical care and clean drinking water.” It was this treatment of refugees and asylum seekers that prompted the Greens to draft their “federal multicultural act”, which the party believes will enshrine multilateral support for multiculturalism in the law. The exposure bill states the proposed legislation will “promote full participation by Australia’s diverse communities in the social, cultural, economic and political life of Australia; promote access by Australia’s diverse communities to services made available by governments and other bodies,” and “encourage all of Australia’s diverse communities to retain and express their social identity and cultural inheritance and to promote mutual respect.” The bill also aims to promote unity, understanding and harmony among Australians and promote the social and economic benefits of diversity. The legislation would require government organisations and departments to provide an annual report to the minister detailing action taken to promote multiculturalism, the use of interpreting and translating services, and the extent to which people from diverse backgrounds were represented on boards and committees. Di Natale’s speech will say that reforms are needed “because multiculturalism is too important to play politics with”. “An Australian multiculturalism act would set up a scaffolding effect that supports multicultural Australia,” he will say. The Greens will consult with the community on the exposure bill and will aim to introduce it to the Senate before the parliamentary term."
2017-12-22T16:56:53Z,Efforts to resettle child refugees under Dubs scheme 'completely inadequate',"The Home Office is facing fresh criticism after confirming it is yet to fill all the spaces it reserved for unaccompanied child refugees from Europe under the Dubs scheme. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, described the government’s approach as “completely inadequate” after it set out its position in its formal response to a report published by the committee earlier this year. Cooper also said her committee would hold fresh hearings on the subject in the future, saying that government claims to be serious about tackling modern slavery “look hollow” in the light of its unwillingness to help unaccompanied children at risk of trafficking on the continent. In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by Lord Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. At the time it was expected that around 3,000 children would benefit from the scheme, but when the government announced details in February 2017 it said only 350 spaces would be available. That number was subsequently increased to 480. On Friday, in its response to the home affairs committee’s report, the Home Office said the number of children who had arrived in the UK under the Dubs scheme was “over 200” and that Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has written to her counterparts in France, Greece and Italy inviting more referrals from eligible children. To be eligible, children have to have arrived in Europe before March 2016 and it has to be in their best interests for them to come to the UK. Priority is supposed to be given to those deemed vulnerable, including at risk from trafficking. In its response to the committee, the Home Office also said the total number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in local authority care in the UK was over 4,000 – around 10 times as many as may eventually be accepted under the Dubs scheme. Dismissing the Home Office response as complacent, Cooper, a Labour MP, said ministers should be doing much more to take advantage of the spaces for unaccompanied child refugees that were available. “Contrary to speedily delivering the Dubs scheme, less than half the places councils offered at the beginning of the year have been filled even though unaccompanied refugee children are spending another winter in camps or other unsuitable shelters in Greece and Italy,” she said. “All the government’s commitments to tackle modern slavery look hollow when they are still resisting implementing a scheme to prevent teenagers being exploited and trafficked in Europe. “This remains a policy failure by the home secretary and the committee will revisit this issue in the future.” The government came up with 480 as the total number of children it could accept after consulting with local councils to see how many they could take. The home affairs committee report earlier this year suggested that a further 4,000 places could be available if councils received appropriate funding from central government. But the Home Office response on Friday said that this figure was wrong because it was based on the assumption that a threshold for the maximum number of child refugees any single authority is supposed to take could become a target for all of them to meet."
2017-12-24T00:05:36Z,We can’t break a promise to take in child refugees | Barbara Ellen,"Is the plight of lone child refugees yesterday’s news for this government? Is it hoping that the public will simply stop caring and the outrage, the headlines and the problem are just going to melt away? It appears that the Home Office isn’t filling the spaces reserved for unaccompanied child refugees under the Dubs scheme. This year, the places, which were expected to number around 3,000, were announced to be limited to 350. After a public outcry and intervention from the House of Lords, this was increased to 480. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, now says that the number of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK specifically under the Dubs scheme is “over 200”, which sounds carefully vague. (The government has been steadfastly unco-operative about committing to numbers.) Yvette Cooper, in the role of chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says that government promises are looking “hollow” regarding unaccompanied child refugees (who are at grave risk of trafficking and other exploitation) and that the Home Office response is “completely inadequate”. It also sounds chaotic, the mess further complicated by the government saying that there were already around 4,000 lone asylum-seeking children in care in the UK. This figure, if accurate, was brandished at Cooper and the committee as if it were someone else’s doing – that it somehow wasn’t the government’s fault that there was such widespread disorder. Similarly, when Cooper pointed out that 3,000 unaccompanied child refugee places could still be made available by local councils, should further central government funding become available, the response was that this wasn’t an actual target, just a figure relating to the maximum number of child refugees who could be helped. But, or so went the implication, they sure as hell wouldn’t be. Well, thanks for clearing that up. Merry Christmas! It bears repeating that the figure of 3,000 lone child refugees wasn’t plucked out of the “handwringing do-gooder” ether. It was part of the original campaign for the Dubs amendment – in that it was deemed fair and appropriate for Britain to help 3,000 of the estimated 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees, in the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. (Of course, there are innumerable other child and adult refugees.) To give it some context, around 200,000 asylum seekers were accepted into the UK over a three-year period after the break-up of Yugoslavia. When the figure of 3,000 was so drastically reduced, there was widespread public disgust bordering on national shame. How could the UK restrict the Dubs scheme to helping such a small number of vulnerable, unprotected children? Let’s be clear, nobody, among campaigners or the public, said: “Let everybody in the world come here if they want to”; “Ignore British citizens in need – I prefer helping foreign people!”; “I insist that you let in grown men with beards, and wives, as ‘child refugees’ under the Dubs scheme.” Or write your own ludicrous rightwing smearing of “woolly liberals” that kicks off whenever helping refugees is on the agenda. Rather, there was a very specific reaction to the predicament of lone child refugees – kids who’d gone through so much and were at such high risk. This seems to be the very gut instinct that this government would prefer the British public to forget it ever had. Which makes it even more important for them to be held to account, not just by the Commons committee, but also by public vigilance. The government can’t make insincere “oh dear” noises about lone child refugees and then not even meet the puny total it permitted via the Dubs scheme. It should also respond to ongoing concern about all the other child refugees languishing in dangerous, unsuitable camps and shelters across Europe. As 2017 draws to a close, it would be nice to think that the lone child refugee crisis is top of the agenda for 2018."
2017-12-19T12:01:33Z,Asylum seekers record festive single to raise awareness of refugees' plight,"They escaped persecution, violence and torture in some of the most brutal countries in the world. Now, a group of asylum seekers have come together with professional musicians to record a single for the festive season, an uplifting rendition of Bill Withers’ Lean On Me. The One Heart Refugee Choir, made up of 24 refugees from countries including Zimbabwe, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Jamaica and Kazakhstan, decided to record the track as a symbol of the resilience of the human spirit, and to offer a message of solidarity. Tamara McFarlane, one of the singers in the choir, said: “Refugees’ and asylum seekers’ voices are rarely heard in this country. “Usually we are hidden. We have all been through terrible things, but our spirits are strong. We hope that the song’s message, urging human beings to unite, is one that people across the UK can get behind.” Less than 1% of the world’s 2.2 million refugees make it to the UK to claim asylum, yet those who do often struggle to overcome the stigma placed on asylum seekers and experience social and institutional hostility. As a Guardian video revealed, they often live in filthy, overcrowded and dangerous conditions in Home Office accommodation. Those in the One Heart choir have escaped rape, torture and forced female genital mutilation. One of the singers had to flee Zimbabwe for resisting Robert Mugabe’s regime, while another from South Africa was subjected to “corrective rape” after it was found she was a lesbian. The choir said the song gave them an opportunity to present an antidote to the negative associations often placed on asylum seekers. Lean On Me was originally written by Withers in 1972 as a testament to the power of community spirit that he had known growing up in a poor coalmining town in West Virginia. One of the professional singers involved in the collaboration, Nina Miranda of the band Smoke City, said she had encouraged fellow musicians to get involved because “the message of human solidarity, especially in times of adversity, has never been more important”. “Everyone had a wonderful day recording the song and it was a real pleasure to perform with the talented members of the One Heart choir. We hope the song will raise awareness and funds for asylum seekers and refugees,” she said. The song is also being used to raise awareness and funds to help refugees. Proceeds will go to Refugee Action and donations can be made here."
2017-11-07T17:00:21Z,Appeals tribunal cases increase 600% and flood 'coming down the pipeline',"The tribunal that allows refugees, veterans and welfare recipients to challenge government decisions has been burdened by a vast increase to its workload, new figures show. The administrative appeals tribunal is an important part of the federal justice system, allowing the most vulnerable to challenge administrative decisions made by government. That includes migrants and refugees who have had a visa denied or cancelled, welfare security recipients who have been issued a debt, or veterans who have been ruled ineligible for support. A total of 6,581 matters were lodged with the AAT in 2014-15, which increased 600% to 41,432 in 2015-16, largely as a result of its amalgamation with several other tribunals. But the increase to its workload continued last financial year. It had 51,426 matters lodged in 2016-17, an increase of 24%. The number of cases finalised and still ongoing also increased by significant amounts. One tribunal source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the increase in workload had not been accompanied by increases to resources. The source warned the new caseload, when matters began to reach hearing, would place a significant burden on the tribunal. “It usually takes even with accelerated matters, six to nine months to take matters into a hearing,” the source said. “So we haven’t had too many of them in hearings before the tribunal yet. “But the flood is coming down the pipeline, as it were.” The growth is largely driven by migration and refugee cases, which account for 52% of the total cases lodged last financial year and 71% of the matters on hand. Ben Lumsdaine, a solicitor with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said delays in the tribunal were worsening and had stretched out beyond six to nine months for a hearing. “A lot of the matters for our clients have taken a lot longer than that,” he said. “It is quite variable but it’s not unusual for it to take longer than that. “It seems like the waiting time has been increasing.” Appeals against national disability insurance scheme decisions have also quadrupled in a year, placing additional weight on Australia’s already overloaded administrative appeals tribunal system. The number of appeals against NDIS decisions rose from 46 in 2015-16 to 186 the following year, according to the national disability agency’s annual report. The AAT cases largely relate to decisions to deny access or not fund certain support services for people with a disability. The increase in appeals is explained by the rapid rise in the number of NDIS participants, from 30,281 in 2015-16 to 90,638 the next year. “As the number of NDIS participants increases, it is not unreasonable to also expect growth in related activities,” a National Disability Insurance Agency spokeswoman said. “These activities include new access and planning decisions, routine scheduled reviews, as well as complaints and/or appeals. As the roll out of the NDIS progresses, the NDIA will continue to put the best outcomes for participants at the core of our decision-making.” NDIS cases are a fraction of the tribunal’s workload. But the tribunal source said the NDIA often fails to invest enough resources into running its cases, making them more difficult to deal with. “We’ve had a disproportionately large number of [NDIS] appeals to the tribunal,” the source said. “And they show every sign of not coping very well with the influx in applications for support. “On a number of occasions, to be frank, the NDIA has not adequately resourced themselves for the matters that have come before the tribunal. They’ve been all over the shop.”"
2017-08-14T13:47:04Z,Three NGOs halt Mediterranean migrant rescues after Libyan hostility,"Three NGOs have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because of the increasingly hostile stance of the Libyan authorities and coastguard. Save the Children and Germany’s Sea Eye have joined Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) in halting operations because they feel their crews can no longer work safely in what Sea Eye called a “changed security situation in the western Mediterranean”. Libya has asserted its right to operate well beyond the territorial limit of 12 nautical miles, defending the move as necessary in order to control the rescue operations. Coastguard ships have repeatedly clashed with NGO vessels on the edge of Libyan waters, sometimes opening fire. The crew of a rescue ship belonging to the Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms reported last week that the Libyan coastguard had fired warning shots while the vessel was in international waters. The Libyan coastguard told the ship not to come “or we will shoot you”, the charity said. Marcella Kraay, a coordinator with MSF onboard Aquarius, a vessel chartered by the German-French charity SOS Méditerranée, told the Guardian: “Obviously these incidents are something that concern us. “Shooting in the air is actually a very common message of crowd control – it’s used to calm people down. What happened last week with Proactiva is not a big departure from the concerns we had before. We take this stuff very seriously in our security analysis.” But Kraay said the crew’s main concern was for people being sent back to “lawless, violent” Libya, and for those who remain trapped there. Migrants and refugees who have spent time in detention camps in Libya have reported appalling treatment including forced labour, beatings, torture and rape. “This is the real issue,” Kraay added, saying fewer boats had appeared to be leaving in the past couple of weeks and there was evidence that many were being turned back. “People in Libya are suffering immensely, their only way out is via the sea.” A Libyan coastguard official, Ayoub Qassem, said that in general, the country “does not reject the NGOs’ presence, but we do demand from them more cooperation with the state of Libya. They should show more respect to Libyan sovereignty”. Sea Eye said it had reached its decision “with a heavy heart”. In a statement on the group’s Facebook page, its founder, Michael Busch Heuer, said it would “leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean”, adding that Libya had made an “explicit threat” against NGOs operating around its coast. Save the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would stay in Malta until it received assurances from the Libyan authorities. “The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,” said the group’s operations director, Rob MacGillivray. Tensions have also been mounting for weeks between the aid groups, whose vessels have rescued nearly one-third of the 100,000 migrants who have landed in Italy this year, and the government of Italy, where public opinion is increasingly turning against migrants. The Italian navy is providing technical and operational assistance to Libya’s coastguard to increase its capacity to intercept migrant boats and return their passengers to Libya, while some politicians in Rome have suggested that certain NGOs may be actively facilitating people smuggling. Rome has drawn up a strict code of conduct for NGOs at sea and prosecutors in Sicily have begun investigations against some they suspect of colluding with people smugglers. The Italian foreign minister, Angelino Alfano, said Libya’s growing involvement was reducing people smuggling. In an interview in La Stampa on Sunday, Alfano said Rome aimed to avoid deaths at sea by “reducing departures” from Libya. The government’s policy was of “taking away criminal earnings from traffickers, because fewer persons departing mean the traffickers earn less”, to finance aid agencies working with refugees and migrants to “assure respect for human rights in Libyan camps”. The vast majority of refugees and migrants reaching Europe this year have landed in Italy, according to the International Organisation for Migration. At least 2,242 people are thought to have died this year attempting to cross the western and central Mediterranean."
2017-11-15T20:06:31Z,Arson drives Syrian refugee family from their Merseyside home,"Police are appealing for information after the home of a Syrian refugee family was set alight in Merseyside and they were forced to flee in the middle of the night. Police confirmed the fire was an arson attack in which an accelerant, probably petrol, was pushed through the letterbox of their St Helens home and set alight. The attack occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning while the family of five were inside. Neighbours raised the alarm and helped them escape. The family, a woman, who is pregnant, a man and their three children, aged five, three and two, arrived in the UK under the government’s Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme (VPRS), and have been living in St Helens since January. The family suffered from smoke inhalation and significant damage was caused to the property. Police confirmed they were keeping an open mind about the motive of the attack, but were considering hate crime along with other motives including mistaken identity. They said the family had not been targeted before this incident, and that officers would be “relentless” in their pursuit of the perpetrators. DI Louise Birchall said: “The occupants of this home, a Syrian family with three young children, were thankfully not more seriously hurt. The swift response from the emergency services ensured that everyone was brought to safety. “I am sure that the community will be appalled that an innocent family would be subjected to such a frightening attack in their own home, and we will be relentless in identifying those responsible and bringing them to justice.” The family are currently living in a hotel and are being supported by neighbours and Refugee Action. “This obviously has been a really distressing incident for them and one that will create great anxiety for them and other refugees in that area and elsewhere,” said Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, which has been supporting the family since they arrived in the UK. “This happened in the middle of the night, neighbours raised the alarm and were very quick in supporting them to get out of the house,” said Hale. “It really is a horrendous incident. Obviously there’s huge support among communities where we work and people are keen to support refugees, but there are a tiny minority of people who think differently and are perpetrating acts like this. The police are saying we can’t know motives at this time but it’s a deeply concerning act and hugely traumatising for the family.” St Helens council committed to receiving 60 refugees as part of the Syrian VPRS, which will see 20,000 refugees brought to the UK from camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan by 2020. Police are urging anyone with any information about the attack to call 101, quoting incident number 181 of 12 November, or to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
2018-11-28T18:33:30Z,Refugee agency accused of helping deport relatives of migrant children,"The federal agency tasked with caring for asylum-seeking children separated from their parents at the US-Mexican border has officially taken on a new, little-publicized role in recent months: helping to deport relatives of the young migrants. More than 40 potential sponsors of detained migrant children in the US may be deported because a government agency that is supposed to help refugees instead uses minors to glean information on their US-based relatives, activists warned on Wednesday. Civil rights advocates said in a letter to top Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Wednesday that this data is being employed to “arrest and deport those families”, making these relatives “too scared to step forward to sponsor children”. The initiative – described as an information-sharing accord that was “quietly” solidified in April – reflects a novel role for the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which comes under the HHS umbrella. The HHS section is supposed to help unaccompanied migrant children by reuniting them with family until their immigration cases are decided. “Children are being turned into bait to gather unprecedented amounts of information from immigrant communities,” Becky Wolozin, a Legal Aid Justice Center lawyer, said in the letter. From July to September, at least 41 family or household members of children who have been separated from their parents were detained for deportation due to this information-swapping. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) official recently told Congress that more than 80% of potential sponsors lived in the US illegally. Potential sponsors’ fingerprints and other personal information are entered into a DHS system. While this database was initially meant to track criminal records, it was modified in May to assist with immigration verification. Because authorities at local, state and federal levels of the US government have extensive access to this data, would-be sponsors could be put under unprecedented scrutiny. While federal authorities maintain this initiative is geared toward protecting migrant children from abusers and traffickers, migrant children entering the US unlawfully are spending increasing amounts of time in federal custody. Bob Carey, who ran the resettlement agency for nearly two years until January 2017, said the average time in custody for unaccompanied children “hovered around 33 days the entire time I was there”. Now it’s closer to 70 days, HHS says. Trump administration officials show no signs of budging. The Associated Press asked the Office of Refugee Resettlement how the new policies square with its mission to place children as quickly as possible with relatives or other sponsors. The office did not respond directly, but in an emailed reply called the longer stays “a symptom of the larger problem, namely a broken immigration system that encourages them to make the hazardous journey”. Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School says the arrangement effectively puts prospective sponsors in an “active queue” for deportation because their case files appear prominently when Ice enforcement agents open the database. DHS privacy policy says Ice can also share the information with “appropriate federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, foreign or international government agencies”. The revelations come amid ever heightening tensions over the US’s handling of asylum seekers – and increasingly rancorous debate over immigration policy. Dozens of people rushed toward the border crossing at Tijuana and San Diego on Sunday. A handful tried breaching the border fence, and US customs agents fired teargas to stop migrants from approaching. Mexico, which deported at least 100 migrants following the incident, announced plans to expel some 500 accused of trying to “illegally” and “violently” cross the border. American authorities said on Monday that they had arrested 42 migrants on the US side of the border."
2018-07-20T14:23:05Z,Libya rejects EU plan for refugee and migrant centres,"Libya has rejected a EU plan to establish refugee and migrant processing centres in the country, adding that it would not be swayed by any financial inducements to change its decision. The formal rejection by the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, is a blow to Italy, which is regarded as being close to his Tripoli administration. In June, Italy proposed reception and identification centres in Africa as a means of resolving divisions among European governments. The impasse came as the EU said it was willing to work as a temporary crisis centre to oversee the distribution of refugees and migrants from ships landing in Europe from Libya. Italy has said it is not willing to open its ports and may even reject those rescued by the EU Sophia search and rescue mission, a position that has infuriated other EU states. Speaking to the German newspaper Bild, Serraj said: “We are absolutely opposed to Europe officially wanting us to accommodate illegal immigrants the EU does not want to take in.” He dismissed accusations that Libya’s coastguard had shot at aid workers in ships trying to rescue people from the Mediterranean. “We save hundreds of people off the coast of Libya every day – our ships are constantly on the move,” he said. In practice, Libya is already running detention camps, largely as holding pens, but they are not run as EU processing centres for asylum claims.European foreign ministers agreed at a meeting on Monday to do more to train the Libyan coastguard by setting up the EU’s own training team inside Libya. The European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, said after a trip to Niger, one of the chief funnels for people into Libya, that the EU needed to plough more money into the Sahel region to reduce the need to leave the area. He said the number of people reaching Libya from Niger was collapsing. Tajani said: “Until 2016, 90% of irregular migrants travelled through the Niger to Libya and Europe. In just two years, Niger reduced migration flows by 95%, from over 300,000 to about 10,000 in 2018.” He said he would host a European conference in Brussels in October to support democratic elections in Libya scheduled for December. At the same time, Italy is to host a further conference in Rome in September seen as a follow-on to a conference held in May by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that led to a commitment to hold elections this year."
2018-08-01T18:04:03Z,Art project listing names of dead refugees and migrants is destroyed,"An art project featuring a list of the 34,361 refugees and migrants who lost their lives trying to reach Europe has been destroyed in Liverpool. The list, which the Guardian published as a special supplement in June, was produced for World Refugee Day. It was posted on hoardings outside a building site in Liverpool’s Chinatown as part of the Liverpool Biennial art festival. On Wednesday the festival tweeted: Some people suggested a council worker may have mistaken the artwork for illegal flyposters and taken it down, but a spokesman for Liverpool city council said he had checked and was “100% sure” the list had not been removed by anyone employed by the local authority. The list was posted on the hoardings with the permission of the developers who own the site. They were trying to look at CCTV footage to see if their cameras had caught the culprit, the council spokesman said. Compiled and updated each year by United for Intercultural Action – an anti-discrimination network of more than 560 organisations across Europe – The List traces information relating to the deaths of 34,361 refugees and migrants who have lost their lives within or on the borders of Europe since 1993. In collaboration with art workers and institutions, the Istanbul-based artist Banu Cennetoğlu has produced up-to-date and translated versions of The List since 2007 using public spaces such as billboards, transport networks and newspapers. The Liverpool Biennial said in a statement: “It is timely and important to make The List public during a global refugee crisis. We were dismayed to see it had been removed on Saturday night and would like to know why. The List has been met with critical acclaim and we are doing everything we can to reinstate it.” Liverpool Biennial is the UK’s largest festival of contemporary visual art. Every two years, it commissions international artists to make and present work in the context of Liverpool in public spaces, galleries, museums and online."
2018-12-13T21:00:23Z,Coalition plans inquiry into integration and employment of refugees,"The federal government has announced an inquiry into the “integration, employment and resettlement” of refugees and humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review, to be led by Professor Peter Shergold, has broad ranging terms of reference that would allow the investigation of welfare and support services, employment requirements and work rights, and any other factor that relates to the improvement of outcomes for resettled refugees and the community. Shergold, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, has been tasked to develop recommendations to improve policy and “better ensure refugees and humanitarian entrants can make valuable contributions to our society and our economy,” said prime minister Scott Morrison. It can invite submissions and seek information, and is expected to report back by late February. Guardian Australia understands the terms of reference allow Shergold significant freedom to examine all aspects of support services and employment issues for refugees and humanitarian migrants. “The review should seek out best practice case studies of how Australians can work together to encourage integration of refugees and humanitarian entrants in the wider community, including identifying significant barriers to success,” said one term of reference. Shergold told Guardian Australia the focus of the review was those settled in Australia as refugees, who have equivalent rights to citizenship, rather than asylum seekers. “It’s generally seen that refugees come with many skills and experiences, and refugees tend to be risk takers, entrepreneurial,” he said. “They are the group of Australians most likely to derive income from setting up family businesses. They problem is … it’s the hardest thing to do because you have to overcome language barriers, you need your overseas qualifications and experience accepted, and your first experience in the Australian labour market.” He said assisting this was something governments struggled with the most, and the JobActive employment program “isn’t working particularly well”. Shergold, who is coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW, will be joined on the review by Kerrin Benson, chief executive of Multicultural Development Australia, and Margaret Piper, the former executive director of the Refugee Council of Australia. “I think it’s important that almost from the day refugees arrive, we start to talk to them from day one, about what are their aspirations for employment … and provide them with the advice they need,” he said. “It’s no use waiting for two or three years and then talking to them.” Shergold declined to comment on recent cuts to support for asylum seekers on temporary visas, who would potentially become refugees accessing the support services the review will recommend. Last year the government began stripping services and welfare payments from a large cohort of asylum seekers currently on short term bridging visas, giving them work rights but removing housing support and other payments. The decisions, which have continued to roll out this year, have been condemned by refugee, migrant and community services sectors, who say it will force people into homelessness and poverty, and appears to have been applied arbitrarily to people including the ill and elderly, despite their lower capacity to support themselves. Earlier this month parliament passed legislation forcing another group of migrants – those on permanent skilled or family visas – to wait up to four years for some welfare support services and payments. The review was announced via press release from Morrison and the immigration minister, David Coleman. “We want to make sure we are doing everything we can to help people get jobs and integrate into the community,” Morrison said. “Having a job gives people financial independence, increases their personal connections and is one of the quickest ways to improve language skills.” Coleman said Australia had clear responsibilities in building a stronger and “more socially cohesive” society. “This review will ensure refugee and humanitarian entrants, those that have already arrived and those not yet here, are best placed to succeed and contribute to the Australian way of life.” Labor questioned the need for the review when the joint standing committee on migration had already investigated settlement outcomes for migrants, including refugees. The committee recommended the Jobactive program include employment support services specifically designed for newly arrived and longer term migrants. The government “noted” but did not accept the recommendation, saying it was already “taking steps to provide better support for newly arrived refugees”. Labor’s immigration spokesman, Shayne Neumann, questioned the timing of the announcement. “Why is Scott Morrison trying to rush this review through the Christmas period?” Neumann said."
2018-07-13T09:00:10Z,Moscow refugee tournament throws stark light on Russia’s migrant policy,"A few hours before England’s World Cup game against Colombia in Moscow, a very different series of football matches was under way on Red Square. There was no penalty shootout drama but off the pitch the stakes for some of those involved were much higher. The five-a-side tournament, held just outside the walls of the Kremlin, pitted teams of refugees against each other, and was meant both as a celebration of diversity through football and as a message to the Kremlin over Russia’s restrictive asylum policy. Some of the players had fled conflict in Africa or the Middle East, while others were aspiring footballers from African countries who had been trafficked to Russia with the promise of a playing contract. One was Joshua Olumide, an 18-year-old from Ondo State in Nigeria, who said his father had taken out a loan to pay a man who promised him a contract with a European club. He was given a Fan ID, the document that allows visa-free travel to Russia for the duration of the World Cup, and told he would be met at the airport in Moscow. Nobody met him and another Nigerian who had also made the journey with a promise of a contract. He spent five days living in the airport and has since been living in makeshift accommodation in Russia trying to get money together for a ticket home. “It’s very sad but I am going to have to go home. My father took out a big loan to help me come here,” he said. Russians have welcomed with open arms the hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have descended on the country but it is feared the effect may be only temporary and is unlikely to extend to those seeking sanctuary rather than just arriving for a few weeks of football. Svetlana Gannushkina, one of the leading Russian rights activists working with migrants and refugees, said Russia’s basic position on asylum is “nobody is given status and we pretend that refugees don’t exist”. She said only 592 people had been given refugee status in Russia in recent years. The one exception has been those fleeing the conflict in eastern Ukraine, who have a relatively easy path to either temporary residency or citizenship. For Syrians, of whom Gannushkina estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 seeking refugee status in Russia, the process is much harder: she said only two had been granted status. The tournament on Red Square was a reminder that many refugees are talented and hard-working and she hoped the “celebratory, friendly mood” of the World Cup would continue after the tournament is over. “It’s really symbolic to have these games played here,” said Piara Powar, the executive director of Fare, an umbrella organisation promoting diversity in football that helped set up the tournament. “To see these guys, some of whom have no papers, whose kids are being fed and educated by volunteer groups, playing football in the shadow of the Kremlin is quite something.” He said assurances had been sought and given by Russian authorities that the refugees would not face document checks or arrest if they came to Red Square for the tournament. Alexei Smertin, the former Chelsea and Russia midfielder, and the anti-racism inspector for Russia’s World Cup committee, played in one of the games, which took place on a five-a-side pitch set up on Red Square for the duration of the World Cup. Other games have included a match between England and Russia fans, which the Russians won 15-1."
2018-10-02T11:28:02Z,Pro-refugee Italian mayor arrested for 'aiding illegal migration',"The mayor of an Italian town that has won praise and TV publicity for integrating thousands of refugees has been placed under house arrest on suspicion of abetting illegal migration. Riace mayor Domenico Lucano – hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders – is also accused of fraudulently awarding contracts for waste disposal as well as organising “marriages of convenience” between local men and foreign women. His partner, Tesfahun Lemlem, faces the same charges and has had her residency blocked. The investigation against Lucano began more than a year ago, although more serious allegations of embezzlement and fraud were dropped. His arrest comes a week after Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, announced a series of anti-immigration measures that included slashing funds for migrant reception and integration. It also follows the suspension by the public broadcaster, Rai, of a TV show about Riace, which had been lauded as an exemplary model for integration. Salvini shared news of Lucano’s arrest on Twitter, alongside a comment that also made a dig at the anti-mafia author, Roberto Saviano, a staunch critic of his policies. “Damn, who knows what Saviano and all the other do-gooders who want to fill Italy with immigrants will say now,” the far-right League leader wrote. The Guardian was unable to reach Lucano for comment. His migrant integration project began more than a decade ago as a way to repopulate and revive the economy of the Calabrian town whose population by 2004 had dwindled to 500 from about 3,000 before the second world war. Thousands of migrants are estimated to have passed through since then, with about 500 making up today’s population of 1,500. Gioacchino Criaco, a writer from Calabria who knows Lucano well, said he foresaw the mayor’s arrest even before the investigation began. “He showed how it was possible to do concrete things with limited means,” Criaco said. “Efficiency and humanity are not welcomed in a cynical system. This is a system that only takes consensus from politics of fear. In this respect, examples of virtuousness must be eradicated.” Criaco said Lucano was an honest man but that the “rules on the reception and management of migrants are too tangled, and often administrators can find themselves caught in a dilemma between a humanitarian choice and a legal one”. Salvini has cracked down on immigration since becoming interior minister in June, closing off the sea ports and pledging to “end the gravy train” for those working in the migrant reception business. Lucano received a show of support on his Facebook page, with Riace locals calling on each other to rally together in solidarity. Sergio Bontempelli, a migrant rights campaigner with the Association of Rights and Borders, said that Riace had become too well known as an example of good integration and had been under attack for years. He said other integration projects undertaken by hundreds of people in other Italian towns were now at risk."
2018-11-29T11:00:06Z,Calling this exodus a 'migrant caravan' obscures the heart of the matter | Mark Isaacs,"When I first heard of the “migrant caravan” I thought it was a grossly inadequate way to describe this mass movement of people. The more I have learned about the movement, the more convinced I am of its inappropriateness as a definition. Thus far, I have been using it for social media purposes but I want to break down the terminology. The term “migrant” is a misnomer. It gives the impression that these people have similar situations to us. It implies they can apply for a visa, get a job and relocate their families the legal way just like an Australian might migrate to the United Kingdom for work. It is misleading to use the term migrants for a group of people who are fleeing criminal violence, authoritarian governments, corrupt security forces, economic failure and extreme poverty. It is misleading to imply that these people have the same opportunities to migrate as people from Australia, the US or other wealthy nations. While there are legal visas from Central American people to travel, live and work in the US, the likelihood of these “caravan” people – who are for the most part members of the impoverished working class – being allowed legal entry to the US is low. Their “flight risk” would be considered high and as a result they would most likely not be awarded visas or be allowed into the country. There is also the challenge of their own capability to navigate the immigration system, obtain passports, visas and flights. That’s why for many the decision to join the caravan was impulsive. They took what they saw as an opportunity when it arose, not really understanding the immigration process. Many have been learning about migration law, the asylum-seeking and refugee process, and repatriation rights on the road to the US thanks to the work of UNHCR and other such organisations. Perhaps I wouldn’t feel so strongly about this term if I hadn’t seen “migrant” used negatively before. European countries used the same language when describing the influx of refugees fleeing Syria and Afghanistan as a “migrant crisis”. Such language masked the fact that these people were running away from war zones and violence and justified European countries’ desire to refuse assistance. Many of those European countries were directly responsible for the conditions that precipitated the mass movement of people throughout the region. If US and Nato had properly stabilised and rebuilt Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US and Nato invasion, then the next decade and more of conflict in Afghanistan wouldn’t have forced so many “migrants” to the European continent. Similar geopolitical dynamics are being played out in the US currently. This is a mass exodus of people from Central American states that have been the victims of US political interventions for decades. Ongoing US intervention in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala has destabilised and militarised the region, leading to an increase in people migrating to the US. Blaming immigrants for fleeing poverty and violence is a simple response to a complex problem. A better way to stem the future flow of migrants might be to re-examine US foreign policy in Central America. President Trump is happy to ignore this history, or perhaps he never learned the lessons of US foreign policy. He has been using the “migrant caravan” as a political tool, ramping up his already virulent anti-migrant rhetoric to stoke fear and suspicion of the members of the caravan and militarise the border. His manipulation of the issue shows how important language can be when talking about displaced people. The reality is that many of these people face dire threats to their life, whether that be directly due to violence or indirectly due to poverty and political instability. Many people in the caravan intend to ask for asylum when they reach the border of the United States. Many have already asked for asylum in Mexico and have been awarded refugee visas. Many people have told me that they are leaving their countries because there is no work but even then I don’t believe the term migrant is necessarily the appropriate terminology to use. In these cases, it is impossible to separate the poverty of the country from the deteriorating political situation and violence that also exists in the country. Often loss of work or inability to find employment precipitates the decision to leave a country, but often the decision to leave one’s country is multifactorial. My argument is not that none of the members of the “caravan” are migrants. My argument is that calling it a “migrant caravan” creates a blanket evaluation of all these people’s stories and allows judgment and suspicion to creep into the minds of the general public. Perhaps there needs to be a new definition for such people, one that acknowledges the dire circumstances which cause them to leave their homes. Perhaps calling them a humanitarian migrant might help.

2018-11-21T17:28:50Z,What is the current state of the migration crisis in Europe?,"More than three years after Europe’s biggest influx of migrants and refugees since the second world war, tensions between EU member states over how to handle irregular immigration from outside the bloc – mainly from the Middle East and Africa – remain high. What is the scale of migration? Numbers are sharply down from their 2015-16 peak because of a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, new border fences in the Balkans, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people are still trying to reach Europe. The UNHCR says Spain has taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea so far this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500. Overland arrivals in Greece have climbed sharply to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period last year. The underlying factors that have led to more than 1.8 million migrants coming to Europe since 2014 have not gone away; most observers believe it is only a matter of time before the number of arrivals picks up significantly once more. Why is it a problem? Everyone agrees Europe needs to urgently overhaul its asylum and immigration rules. At present Spain, Italy and Greece take most of the strain owing to their geographical position on the Mediterranean Sea and the fact that, under EU law, asylum seekers must lodge their applications in the first EU country they enter. However, no one can agree on what to do: some countries want tougher external border controls, others fairer distribution of new arrivals. Any solution will have to balance the concerns of “frontline” southern states with those of wealthier northern “destination” states, while dealing with the refusal of hardline central and eastern ones (such as Hungary and Poland) to accept any migrants at all. What is the wider political context? With anti-immigration sentiment on the rise across the continent, the presence in Italy’s government of the far-right League party of Matteo Salvini, which campaigned on a pledge to send 500,000 irregular migrants home, is making itself felt. The similarly rightwing, populist Freedom party is sharing power in Austria. In Germany – which welcomed more than 1 million migrants in 2015 under Angela Merkel’s open-door policy – the rightwing Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party has kept immigration firmly at the top of the political agenda. After a series of electoral setbacks, the chancellor has said she will not stand again. Polling shows immigration and terrorism remain EU citizens’ top concerns. Where do things stand? The death toll on the central Mediterranean route to Italy has fallen in the past year, but the number of those drowning as a proportion of arrivals has risen sharply to 2,054 so far this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Amid a string of high-profile cases of migrant rescue boats left drifting at sea, NGO vessels have all but disappeared from the main migration routes to Italy following Salvini’s announcement after taking office this summer that he was closing Italian ports to non-Italian rescue vessels. European leaders papered over their divisions at a crunch summer summit but have so far dodged any formal agreement on refugee quotas, with central states rejecting any form of mandatory action. What will happen now? Merkel is on record as saying the future of the European Union hinges on whether it can find answers to the “vital questions” posed by migration, but although leaders agree on the need to ease the burden on Italy and Greece, details are scarce. Efforts will be shared, but only voluntarily. Members are to take in rescued migrants and establish centres to assess asylum claims on their soil, and the bloc will explore regional processing platforms in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. But so far none of these countries have agreed to help, while a couple have ruled themselves out. Meanwhile Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, is leading a call among some states for a “strong border” to stop an “invasion”. Nothing is yet settled."
2018-12-20T13:44:25Z,Spanish rescuers find 11 dead migrants on boat near Almería,"Spain’s maritime rescue service has found the bodies of 11 people, among them a pregnant woman, on a small boat off the country’s southern coast. The discovery came at the end of a two-day search for the migrant boat and its 55 passengers, who had gone missing about 11 miles (18km) south of the city of Almería. A spokeswoman for the rescue service told the Associated Press that a Spanish navy scientific research vessel had found the drifting boat in the area, east of the strait of Gibraltar, in the early hours of Thursday. Twenty-nine men and four women were still alive onboard, but one of the men later died in a hospital in Almería. Another 11 people remained missing. The service has also been looking for three more boats in the Alboran Sea, two of them carrying more than 55 migrants each. The Almería branch of the Spanish Red Cross called it a “sad and tragic day”, adding that the survivors and the bodies of the dead had been brought into the city’s port. According to local government officials, three young men were still under observation in hospital. Figures from the International Organization for Migration showed more than 55,200 migrants and refugees had reached Spain by sea so far this year, while 743 died in the attempt. “Already this month, more men, women and children have arrived via sea from North Africa than did in any of the year’s first four months,” the IOM said in a recent bulletin. “Migrant sea arrivals to Spain have exceeded 150 per day since 1 November. For the first third of 2018, Spain’s average was under 40 arrivals per day.” The record number of arrivals to Spain – partly driven by the closure of other European routes – has placed huge strains on the country’s migrant reception infrastructure."
2018-10-15T06:00:26Z,Hate speech has silenced the voices of those risking death on Europe's seas | Regina Catrambone,"According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), at least 1,778 people have perished this year in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the world’s deadliest migratory route. But European political leaders rarely mention this figure as they celebrate the results of their current migration policies. This is the highest percentage of fatalities ever recorded along this route. Since last year, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been represented increasingly as numbers, their ordeals under-reported or minimised, their lives used as statistics, not flesh and blood. But when the official narrative is limited to numbers and figures, people disappear. So what’s happening to vulnerable mothers and children stranded, for instance, in Libya? What about elderly people? Who is taking care of them? Are medical conditions being treated? Violence in Libya has escalated recently, further exacerbating a volatile environment that puts at stake the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people trapped amid chaos. There are a number of detention centres, the locations of which vary, where access is mostly forbidden to humanitarian organisations. The UN has often declared that working in Libya is extremely difficult and dangerous, and its staff on the ground can’t cover all humanitarian needs. Last December, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) could see at first-hand the dangers of the situation on the ground and assisted the UNHCR’s staff during an evacuation flight to Niger, where 51 children, 22 women and one man found shelter after a long stay in Libya. Nonetheless, the resettlement plan didn’t work as expected, and many people are still waiting to start their new life in another country. As migration flows intensified in 2013, public opinion showed indignation and empathy, political leaders promised to take immediate action to prevent further deaths and humanitarian organisations consolidated more efficient patterns to welcome rescued people at disembarkation ports. All eyes were focused on the survivors of desperate journeys, but the sea was still killing an unknown number of children, women and men. At that time, Moas was created to mitigate the loss of life and to allow journalists to document what it meant to be in distress out at sea. The impact of these life-saving search-and-rescues was unparalleled for three main reasons: fewer and fewer people died, journalists joined us and we gave voice to the rescued. But, our missions were not limited to rescue. We also provided post-rescue care to migrants and refugees. During their time spent on board, the people rescued didn’t receive only food, water, clothes and blankets, but also comfort and care from the Moas team. No one could say they didn’t know what was going on out at sea. Our mission helped people to share their stories – of trafficking and of hope. Now, it’s all over. Since the end of 2016, the process of dehumanisation has progressively escalated, its peak coming in 2017 when fake news and hate speech reinforced a criminalisation of solidarity. The lack of European empathy and the failure of relocation schemes profoundly changed the way we can operate, and reduced the capacity to perform rescues at sea. Almost all humanitarian boats were forced to suspend or redeploy their missions elsewhere. Merchant ships no longer perform rescues because, they say, they are afraid of being left adrift while waiting to be notified of a disembarkation port while those who survive almost fade away. The evolution of migration flows and policies has constantly silenced the voices of migrants and refugees. We have never known so little about them. Official figures are likely to be underestimates, so we don’t know how many people perish crossing the desert or the sea. We fail to help them if they end up in Libya and we neglect their lives when they step off the boat. They become invisible because we talk about them, but never talk to them, to listen to their stories. It’s easy to dehumanise people whose lives, faces and dreams are unknown. We don’t need much strength to offend and be cruel about people who are just represented by a number. Numbers don’t have feelings, scars or wounds. But behind those figures there is a person with flesh and bone, with dreams and a soul, in search of a peaceful future. Regina Catrambone is the co-founder of Migrant Offshore Aid Station, an organisation that specialises in search and rescue and has saved tens of thousands of people from the Mediterranean"
2018-12-05T22:00:13Z,"Conflicts and poverty drive big jump in global migration, finds report","Rising instances of conflict and poverty have propelled a 20% increase in the number of international migrants over the space of four years, according to a major report from the UN showing the scale of global migration. According to the UN’s International Labour Organization the total number of people who left their home country in search of work, to join family, or to flee conflicts and persecution increased to 277 million last year from 232 million in 2013. In what is the most authoritative attempt so far to chronicle the growing number of people on the move across the planet, the ILO said rising levels of inequality in many parts of the world were having a significant impact, which governments could not ignore by adopting populist policies. Manuela Tomei, the director of the ILO’s conditions of work and equality department, told the Guardian that migration was becoming a “defining feature” of the modern world and that the issues it posed could not be solved by individual nations acting alone. “The way in which migration and labour migration in particular has been dealt with until now is a recipe for disaster. There is a need to place it seriously and highly on the global agenda,” she said. The report comes as support rises for rightwing populist parties in several major economies around the world, fuelled by anti-immigrant sentiment and the hollowing out of the middle class from weak wage growth and austerity policies used after the global financial crisis. Tomei said that scapegoating migrants and imposing tougher border controls was not the answer to solving the socioeconomic and political pressures posed by rising levels of migration, adding that the ILO’s work was carried out to bring facts to a debate that often relies on perceptions and misinformation. “If you’re saying there are hordes of migrants that are invading us, and the numbers are unrelated to reality, this may trigger a syndrome of anxiety and insecurity and the response would be ‘let’s keep them out’,” she said. Some of the increase in the number of international migrants is down to a rising world population, which is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and the better quality of data used to make the ILO’s estimates. However, the organisation did single out the impact from rising inequality and a growing number of conflicts around the world, such as the war in Syria, as well as droughts and other environmental issues. Of the 277 million, 19 million are refugees, 234 million are over the age of 15, and 164 million are workers, according to the ILO estimates, with a particular rise for people moving to improve their economic life chances. Migrant workers were found to overwhelmingly move to wealthier nations, with three-fifths of all migrants concentrated in three regions: North America (23%), south and west Europe (24%) and the Arab states (14%). Arab countries had the largest percentage of migrant workers as a proportion of their overall workforce and had seen big increases in arrivals in recent years as more workers moved to work in major cities like Dubai, Riyadh and Doha, which are experiencing building booms. Across nine out of 11 regions analysed by the ILO, the percentage of migrants in work was higher than that of the local population, showing that when people move abroad they tend to do so for work, rather than other reasons. Migration due to rising inequality comes after the World Bank estimated that almost half of the world’s population – 3.4 billion people – live on less than $5.50 (£4.30) a day, and struggle to meet basic needs. Tomei said: “The widening of income inequalities within countries, and among countries, is a very, very important factor in explaining the reason why so many millions of people are moving across borders to find better working and living conditions.”"
2018-12-16T20:05:23Z,Anti-migrant protesters clash with police in Brussels,"At least 90 people have been arrested after anti-migration protesters clashed with police outside EU institutions in Brussels. Authorities fired teargas and used water cannon as around 5,500 people demonstrated against a UN migration pact signed last week in Marrakech, Morocco, at a rally organised by the Belgian far-right party Vlaams Belang. The non-binding international agreement to manage the global migration crisis has proven politically divisive in Belgium, prompting ministers from a Flemish nationalist party to quit the government last week. Authorities broke up the demonstration after firecrackers and projectiles were thrown on Sunday, according to reporters on the ground. A counter-rally, which drew around 1,000 protesters, and the anti-migration demonstration had initially been banned by Belgian authorities over fears of unrest, but the country’s supreme administrative court overturned the decision. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, was given permission to form a minority administration following the resignations of ministers from the New Flemish Alliance over the UN migration pact. The pact was agreed in July by all 193 UN members except the US, but only 164 formally signed it at the meeting last Monday."
2018-10-20T17:25:39Z,Trapped at the border: the forlorn Hondurans hoping to reach the US,"Dozens of Hondurans fleeing poverty and violence abandoned their efforts to cross through Mexico to the US amid mounting fear and exhaustion, more than a week into the gruelling journey north. As many as 4,000 Hondurans, including pregnant women and children, remain trapped at the Guatemala-Mexico border awaiting permission to continue the long journey to the US. The caravan of thousands started as 160 people nine days ago but its numbers have swelled as more have joined in an attempt to leave poverty and violence behind them. Now a minority have turned back, using transport organised by Guatemalan security forces. “I’m going back because I’ve had enough, and this might be my only chance to go back safely, guarded by policemen,” said 17-year-old Byron Espina from Copán. Espina worked as a coffee picker in a small village called La Entrada, making only pennies, he said, and had hoped to find work in the US. Free buses started arriving late on Friday night, just hours after Mexican riot police had hurled teargas bombs into the frustrated crowd after some migrants broke through a riot-shield cordon to enter Mexican territory. Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, said on Saturday that the caravan of people could seek asylum or enter with the right travel documents, but “irregular entry” would not be tolerated. Fearing further repression and long delays, some started boarding the buses destined for the Honduran border town Agua Caliente, where police have stopped hundreds of migrants from leaving the country to join the exodus north. The escalating intervention by security forces is seen as a direct response to threats by President Trump to cut off millions of dollars of aid to Central America and Mexico if they fail to stop the caravan – the second this year – reaching the US border. Migration is not a crime, and a regional agreement allows free movement for citizens of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua travelling with national ID cards. The director of the Americas for Amnesty International, Erika Guevara Rosas, tweeted: “Honduran migrant caravan is not a security threat, but an act of survival by 100s of people escaping extreme violence, poverty, exclusion, and the inability of their government to protect their rights. The response to this human drama should be one of solidarity and compassion.” The migrants and refugees are mostly fleeing a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption. On Friday night at least eight people were killed during shooting in a bar in Tegucigalpa, Honduras’s capital, one of dozens of similar incidents so far this year. Fewer than one in 10 crimes are prosecuted. Honduras is the most unequal country in the region: two-thirds of people live in poverty. The bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico over the Suchiate river has become a makeshift refugee camp, with thousands of people, including entire families, forced to sleep, eat, and play outside, just metres from growing piles of rubbish. Despite the risks, most are determined to continue. “This uncertainty is part of the trip,” said Fresbindo Carvajal, 24, from Tegucigalpa, who walks with a cane due to a congenital defect in one leg. “I’m still on my way up. No doubt. It’s better to suffer for a moment than a whole lifetime. And if we go back to Honduras we’ll suffer until the day we die. Even if we have to survive on beans and coffee, I’m going.” Protests in support of migration have broken out in cities across Honduras, including outside the US embassy in Tegucigalpa where journalist and ex-congressman Bartolo Fuentes – who was illegally detained and deported from Guatemala last week while accompanying the caravan – spoke to the crowd. “I have seen mothers cry about the bodies of their children. Parents receive the coffins. I hope this stops. Meanwhile, we must accompany our fellow countrymen,” he said on Friday. Marta Sánchez, founder of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, which organises an annual caravan of mothers searching for their children who disappeared while trying to reach the US, said: “This is not a caravan, it’s an exodus. “It’s a popular uprising against the government by people who can take no more of the terrible conditions in Honduras. I’ve never seen anything like it.”"
2018-12-24T20:00:04Z,"Global migration figures higher than previously thought, study finds","Over a five-year period, about one in 80 people around the world migrate to another country, researchers have revealed, in a study that shows more than a quarter of that movement is down to people returning to their country of birth. Global migration is difficult to measure, with data often lacking for developing countries and inaccurate for others. But a pair of researchers in the US say they have come up with a model that provides the most reliable “big picture” view of human migration yet. Crucially, they say, it takes into account the “churn” of people moving into and out of countries, something previous global estimates had not included. “Policies that are set based on a quota of a number of people who enter the country miss out on the fact that you should also be expecting a lot of the existing migrant population to be leaving the country,” said Dr Jonathan Azose, a co-author of the study from the University of Washington. The study, published in the journal PNAS, reveals a model for estimating migration around the world between 1990 and 2015, broken down into five-year chunks. The team say they were able to show the model worked by comparing its results with high-quality migration data from Europe. A key problem with the previous leading global migration estimates, says Azose, is that the approach looked at overall changes in the net number of immigrants in a country over time, without taking into account that many individuals left and others arrived, resulting in underestimates of movement, something the new model tackles. It suggests that between 67 million and 87 million people, including refugees, migrated for each five-year chunk – far higher than previous global estimates of 34m-46 m migrations – and corresponding to 1.13%-1.29% of the global population. The team note that while absolute numbers of people migrating appear to have risen, there has been little change in the proportion of the world’s population who are on the move. That said, key origins and destinations change over time: for example,movement of Syrians in Saudi Arabia to Turkey between 2010 and 2015 were a leading contributor to “transit” migrations, while migration of Syrians from Syria to Turkey and Lebanon were among the largest emigration movements in that period. The new study suggests that while migration to a new country makes up the biggest proportion of human movement, return migration – in which individuals return to their country of birth – accounted for between 26% and 31% of migration in each five-year period. However, the team admit the new model has limitations, including the fact that different countries require individuals to stay there for different lengths of time to be registered as a migrant, and figures for the total number of migrants in each country might not be accurate to start with, meaning possible errors in the data used. But the team say their work could help researchers delve deeper into what causes people to migrate and help them build predictive models for this. Dr Nando Sigona, an expert in international migration and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “Estimating migration flows is extremely difficult. Data are limited and incomplete, especially in less economically developed countries. This contributes to a perception in the west that all migration flows are directed towards the global north,” he said. While the new model had limitations, he added, it offered a more rounded view of global migration, including showing movements between countries in the south and highlighting the large proportion of return journeys. “Finally,” he said, “it shows a world which is more dynamic and on the move than previously thought.”"
2018-12-22T06:00:21Z,How many migrant children are detained in US custody?,"On 8 December, after less than two days in the United States, Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin died in the custody of US border patrol. The seven-year-old girl from Guatemala had crossed the US-Mexico border with her father. They left behind a life in which their family of seven lived on just $5 a day and where she’d never owned a toy or a pair of shoes. Initial reports from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) say that Jakelin died of dehydration and shock but the family have asked for the media to not speculate about the cause of death until a formal autopsy is done. There are many other vulnerable children currently in the custody of US immigration authorities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has nine facilities available to detain children who they have been separated from adults, including family members, or who were unaccompanied when they crossed the border. The average length of stay for a child detained ranges from 100 to 240 days, and these children are often held far from family members and without legal representation. Up-to-date numbers showing how many children are currently being held by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aren’t readily available. Even more shockingly, the DHS itself doesn’t have an accurate database for tracking children whom officials have separated from their parents. In April, they lost track of the whereabouts of 1,475 migrant children and a similar incident happened this September when they weren’t able to account for 1,500 migrant children. Despite all this, estimates have been obtained by journalists. The New York Times reported in September that 12,800 children were in federally contracted shelters based on information that had been reported to members of Congress. Updated estimates published earlier this week now put that number at 15,000. Contractors who were asked to inspect these detention facilities had been warning the DHS for years about the harm they cause to children. Immigration officials have also been arrested for the sexual abuse of children in their care. But the Ice detention center that employs them claims it is not responsible for these abuses. Many businesses involved in the detention of migrants at the southern border have political connections, and have been donors to both the Republicans and the Democrats. In January 2017, the private corrections firm Geo group gave Trump a quarter-million-dollar donation. It also spent $1.7m on lobbying government in 2017 (more than any other private prison contractor) and gave $225,000 to a pro-Trump Super Pac during the election. The Trump administration subsequently gave Geo group over $1.3bn in Ice contracts. In a statement to the New York Times, Geo Group said that its family center “cared exclusively for mothers together with their children since 2014 when it was established by the Obama administration”.

2018-12-25T17:03:43Z,Children among dozens of migrants rescued crossing Channel,"Two children were among dozens of people rescued trying to cross the Channel in the early hours of Christmas Day. A group of 40 migrants, some of whom said they were from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, were picked up by authorities in five separate incidents over a period of around only seven hours. A child was one of the 13 – 11 of whom are understood to be Iraqis and two Iranian – on board a dinghy off the coast of Deal which was spotted just before 7am. A Border Force cutter and lifeboat were dispatched from the Kent coast to rescue the group. An Afghan girl was among eight people, including seven Iranian men, who arrived in Folkestone, Kent, at about 2.40am. Border Force said it was alerted to the group by Kent police ports unit after two of the migrants had arrived at a hotel asking for help explaining their boat was in the harbour. The children will be looked after by social services while the adults have been sent to immigration officials for interview after being checked over by medical staff, the Home Office said. Border Force assisted a French maritime vessel between 5am and 6am rescuing nine migrants, who have been transferred to a coastguard tent in the UK for assessment. A Border Force vessel was also dispatched at 5.50am to help a dinghy travelling towards the UK with eight migrants, including one woman, on board. They have been medically assessed and transferred to immigration officials for interview, the Home Office said. Border Force was alerted at 9.20am to a further two people on board a small boat bound for the UK and said it was being assisted with the help of the Maritime &amp; Coastguard agency. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Border Force has intercepted a number of boats containing migrants attempting to cross the Channel overnight and this morning (Tuesday 25 December), and has deployed resources to deal with these incidents. “The evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. “We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk.”"
2018-12-10T15:58:07Z,UN states agree historic global deal to manage migration crisis,"The first ever international deal on the migration crisis was signed on Monday by a majority of UN states, despite vociferous objections led by the United States. The historic, non-binding global pact seeking to better manage migration was approved by delegates from 164 nations following 18 months of debate and negotiation. German chancellor Angela Merkel hailed it as an “important day”. The UN’s global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration, signed in Marrakech, is aimed at coordinating action on migration around the world. It was rejected by President Donald Trump a year ago. Since then Austria, which holds the EU presidency, has pulled out of the process, along with Australia, Chile, the Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Slovakia and the Dominican Republic. Merkel, who welcomed hundreds of thousand of refugees from Syria and Afghanistan into her country, received a standing ovation on Monday after an impassioned speech in which she said the UN was founded after the second world war and spoke of the “incredible suffering on humankind” wrought by the Nazi regime. The compact, she said, is about “nothing less than the foundation of our international cooperation”. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, said the pact was being misused by some political parties to spread disinformation. Michel, whose coalition government split over his support for the pact, said in Marrakech that the text had sparked “lively debate” in Europe but was being exploited by political parties “to spread lies and mistruth”. He insisted that signing the compact would place “my country … on the right side of history”. Critics argue the accord could challenge national sovereignty and say they fear an influx of migrants. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday it was a myth that the agreement infringed on the sovereignty of member states. Six countries, among them Israel and Bulgaria, are debating whether to quit the deal, a UN spokesman said after the pact was adopted. Thirty out of the 193 UN countries that agreed on the pact did not attend the conference. Marta Foresti, director of the human mobility initiative at the Overseas Development Institute, described the accord as “very significant” and “remarkable”, given the current political landscape. In Europe, legitimate fears of migrants coming into countries have been hijacked by far right groups and in the US, Trump has not only pulled out of the compact, but made strong efforts to convince others to do so. On Friday, the US described the pact as “an effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states”. Foresti said the accord’s status as not legally binding did not mean it would not work. The Paris climate change agreement, she said, was a hybrid of legally and non-legally binding. She said: “Over the last few years we have seen just how badly governments all over the world have failed to put in place policies that protect the lives of migrants and allay public concerns over messy and incoherent approaches to border management. “The global compact for migration will help governments work together to better manage migration and ensure that people making cross-border journeys can do so in a legal, orderly and safe way.” The idea of the agreement was to create a political platform for states to cooperate, she said. The global pact lays out 23 objectives to open up legal migration and discourage illegal border crossings, as the number of people living outside their country of birth globally has surged to more than 250 million. Unicef described the pact as a “historic achievement” for children and states alike. Laurence Chandy, of Unicef, said: “Today, more than 100 countries still have policies of migration detention for children. Imagine if alternatives to migration detention for children were adopted globally, and the number of detained children fell from a million today to zero. Imagine if we could close the gap in access to education and health for migrant children so that such inequities did not exist.”"
2018-11-19T07:00:23Z,'Cages are more dignified': Colombia brings cold comfort for Venezuelans,"The feet of Estilita López, 78 years old, are bloodied and bruised from the arduous journey from Yaracuy, in northern Venezuela, to Bogotá, the Colombian capital. Together with 460 fellow compatriots, she now lives in a new, city-funded migrant camp that has just sprung up on a football pitch near the airport. “I had to leave Venezuela, but this is all there is for us here,” says López, taking shelter from the beating sun in the yellow tent she shares with her daughter and grandchildren as clothes soaked by an earlier downpour dry out on the grass nearby. “We’re waiting to eat something, and I need to see a doctor about my feet.” Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with rampant shortages in staple foods and basic medicines. Hyperinflation has rendered the currency practically worthless, and crime is widespread. The dire situation has triggered an exodus of Venezuelans, arguably the largest mass migration in Latin America’s history. Three million have now fled Venezuela, with more than a million in neighbouring Colombia, where opportunities are scarce according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. City officials estimate that more than 250,000 Venezuelans are living in Bogotá. Just a few blocks from the bus terminal, where many people arrive with only what they can carry, roughly 300 refugees and migrants had established a shantytown overlooking a sewage-strewn canal. Concerned by reports of crime and disease outbreaks, the authorities shut down that camp and opened the new one, where López now sleeps, on Tuesday. “I lived in the old camp for two weeks,” she says. “I was getting more sick every day there, it was disgusting.” Despite better conditions in the new camp, which has showers, portable toilets, and visiting doctors, the field floods during downpours. With the rainy season approaching, some worry about about the health of the refugees. “It’ll turn into a quagmire when the rains come,” says Ricardo Moscoso, who lives in an upmarket apartment building overlooking the camp. “There’s no heating and no real sanitation there … there are cages that are more dignified than this.” María Gabriela Ruiz, 22, fled Venezuela last year with her boyfriend and had been living in an apartment while working odd jobs across the city. Now, seven months pregnant and unable to find work, she lives in the camp. “I don’t feel like a refugee, I feel more like a prisoner,” she says as a group of boisterous teenagers play tag around her. “We have to wait to be given food, and sometimes it doesn’t even arrive … last night, I went to bed hungry.” The camp is not accepting new arrivals, leading many homeless Venezuelans to beg officials at the gate to bring them some food. Despite the hardship, camp residents say it is still better than what they left behind in Venezuela. “There’s no food on the shelves back home, at least here we have food and water,” says Jesus Rafael Brazón, 45, who fled Monagas, in eastern Venezuela, three months ago with 14 members of his family. He too made much of the journey on foot. “In Venezuela I started working as a taxi driver, but now there aren’t even the parts available for repairs.” Brazon, though grateful for the reception he has received in the camp, says he is desperately seeking the right to work. “It’s the only thing that will really help us,” he says. “We need to be able to work, to support ourselves.” Enrique Peñalosa, Bogotá’s mayor, has called on the government to nationalise Venezuelans. “It would be a huge help, not just from a humanitarian point of view but also an economic one,” says Cristina Vélez Valencia, Bogotá’s secretary for social integration. “Many of the people arriving are young people, so it would be a huge demographic boost to have them in the workforce.” Vélez added that the plan is to shut the camp down in January, though what happens after that remains uncertain. “We’re looking at other options,” she says, adding that more permanent refuges for short-term residents are being set up in buildings across the city. “What we don’t want is to keep opening more and more camps.”"

2018-12-30T13:45:57Z,UK migrant ‘crisis’ bears no comparison to EU's 2015 influx,"The recent rise in the number of people attempting to cross the Channel to England from France has been referred to as a “migrant crisis”. However, the numbers are minuscule compared to the height of the EU’s 2015 crisis, when 10,000 people landed in a single day in Greece. More than 220 people have attempted the Channel crossing since the start of November, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary, cut short a family holiday to deal with what he has called a “major incident.” Charities and international humanitarian groups say they have witnessed an increased number of Iranians trying to make the crossing in recent months. In the latest incident, six Iranian men were found on a beach in Kingsdown, near Deal in Kent, on Sunday. Three years ago, Europe’s biggest inflow of migrants and refugees since the second world war was taking place. Up to 220,000 people arrived in Europe by boat in 2014, and more than 900,000 in 2015. The number of people landing in Greece rose from 43,000 in 2014 to more than 750,000 in 2015, while arrivals in Italy dropped slightly from 170,000 to roughly 144,000. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees forced Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras to beg for help as islands equipped to deal with a small annual influx of tourists were overwhelmed. The numbers started to fall after a 2016 EU deal with Turkey, and a 2017 bilateral arrangement between Italy and Libya, but tens of thousands of people each year are still trying to reach Europe. By November, Spain had taken in 56,200 irregular migrants arriving by sea this year, Greece 28,700 and Italy 22,500, according to the UNHCR. The pressure on Greece may have subsided slightly since 2015, but overland arrivals in the year to date have risen to 14,000, a three-fold increase on the same period in 2017. The Channel numbers are also small in the context of wider UK immigration and asylum statistics. According to Home Office data released at the end of November, 7,444 people claimed asylum in the third quarter of this year, of whom people crossing the Channel made up a very small percentage. Far larger numbers arrive by plane seeking asylum from countries like Uganda and DRC but get little media coverage."
2018-12-01T08:00:16Z,Migrants at Mexico border face an uncertain future on their own,"Authorities in Tijuana have started to relocate more than 6,000 Central Americans to a new shelter, after the rundown sports centre where they have been camped out for more than two weeks descended into squalor. Torrential rains this week have compounded the migrants’ misery, flooding the crowded sports complex where they sleep shoulder-to-shoulder in tents and shelters made from cardboard, garbage bags and blankets. Gustavo Alocer, a representative from Mexico’s human rights commission, described the situation as a humanitarian crisis, while UNICEF has said that it is “deeply concerned” for the well-being of more than 1,000 children who arrived in the string of migrant caravans. Meanwhile, the collective momentum which brought the migrants safely through Mexico has dissipated, as caravan members face the dawning realisation that they may be stuck here for months – and that they will make their next steps alone. “Some of the people have opted to go back home, but many are in the process of applying for visas to stay in Mexico or are planning to wait for asylum in the United States – and they need to be cared for,” said Alocer. Around 350 migrants have opted to be deported back to their home countries. But most are planning to stay in Mexico while they plot their next steps. Many of the migrants admit frankly that, when they set out, they had no real strategy beyond reaching the US border. “I didn’t really have much of a plan when I left Honduras: everyone said that we would be able to cross the border – I thought it would be easier,” said 29-year-old Yocelyn Alvarado as she picked up her 3-year-old son Fernando to stop him wondering into vast puddle of stinking floodwater and sodden trash. They were among the last to arrive at the centre, and the only spot they could find was next to a stinking row of portable toilets. “My son is always sick here,” said Alvarado. “if he’s not vomiting, he has diarrhea and a persistent cough. I want to wait for asylum, but now I’m thinking I’ll arrange my paperwork to stay in Mexico and get a job.” Many of the migrants headed North to escape gang violence or political intimidation in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, and had hoped to apply for asylum in the US. But US border authorities limit asylum applications at the San Ysidro border crossing to between 40 and 100 per day, and thousands of people are trapped in the bottleneck. Even before the caravans arrived, an unofficial waiting list managed by migrants themselves had about 3,000 names, and the waiting time to start an asylum application was about a month. Now, the list has ballooned to over 5,000 and the waiting time has doubled Not all the migrants plan to apply for asylum – either because they cannot prove that their lives are in danger or because they are fleeing economic hardship rather than violence. Many of those are now weighing staying in Tijuana, turning back home, or crossing the US border illegally. Outside the shelter, Carlos Alfaro, a 33-year-old construction worker said his neighbourhood in San Salvador, was on the front line between territory claimed by rival gangs. “You can’t cross the street because if you move from one gang’s territory to the other, they’ll kill you. Because I live on the line, they both want to kill me,” he said. But he had no way to prove his story, and knew that he had little hope of claiming asylum. “I guess I’ll stay in Tijuana and find a job. Then we’ll see – at this point I’d rather be in jail in the US than in my country.” Some migrants – unwilling to wait two months to start an asylum application or unable to pay a $3000-$10,000 smuggler’s fee price, have simply been trying to cross into the US on their own. Several groups have trekked down to Tijuana beach, hoping to find a way to slip through holes in the border fence, or clamber over the extra layers of concertina wire the Trump administration has added in recent weeks. Relocating the migrants to the new shelter, has made such efforts more difficult. Situated in one of Tijuana’s most dangerous neighborhoods, the building – a disused concert venue – is more than 15 miles from the US border."
2018-05-29T16:53:05Z,Hungary to criminalise migrant helpers with ‘Stop Soros’ legislation,"Viktor Orbán’s government has introduced a controversial set of laws to the Hungarian parliament, known informally as the “Stop Soros” plan, that would impose jail terms on people or organisations deemed to be aiding illegal immigration. The legislation was a key promise of Orbán’s Fidesz party before elections last month. Fidesz won with a two-thirds majority, meaning the bill and a number of constitutional amendments can be passed without hitches. The bill is known as “Stop Soros” because it targets some organisations funded by the financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom Orbán’s government has demonised for the past year as the main backer of illegal migration to Europe. Rights activists have been worried about the bill because of the potential for any NGOs working to give legal or other aid to migrants arriving at Hungary’s borders to fall under the definition of supporting illegal migration. The text of the legal amendments, published late on Tuesday, did not contain a number of controversial provisions from previous drafts, which stipulated that NGOs working on migration would be subject to national security checks and a 25% tax on foreign funding. However, it is unclear, given that the new law speaks of prison terms for those deemed to be aiding illegal migration, if the absence of those provisions indicates a climbdown. “Those who provide financial means … or conduct this organisational activity on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison,” read part of the law. “This is a legal framework and it will be up to the courts to decide how they will qualify certain activities,” said Csaba Dömötör, state secretary, at a press conference on Tuesday. Additional provisions make it impossible for anyone to claim asylum in Hungary if they passed through a country deemed safe prior to their arrival. The UN’s refugee agency said the package of laws, if passed, would “deprive people who are forced to flee their homes of critical aid and services, and further inflame tense public discourse and rising xenophobic attitudes”. Human Rights Watch has called for Fidesz to be expelled from the European People’s party grouping in the European parliament if the package is passed. The EPP, made up mainly of centre-right parties, has been tolerant of Orbán’s centralising impulses and populist campaigns, but its leaders have reportedly told the party’s leadership that there are certain red lines, including the closure of a Soros-founded university in Hungary. Since 2015, when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through Hungary en route to western Europe, Orbán has based his political programme on harsh anti-migrant sentiment. He ordered the construction of a fence at the border between Hungary and Serbia, and his Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament last month after campaigning almost exclusively on an anti-migrant platform. Earlier on Tuesday, Soros spoke in Paris to a gathering of foreign policy experts and suggested Europe needed to do more to support democratic governments in Africa to reduce the number of migrants fleeing them. He described a Europe in crisis, but accused populists of exploiting the situation. “The whole of Europe has been disrupted by the refugee crisis. Unscrupulous leaders have exploited it even in countries that have accepted hardly any refugees. In Hungary, Victor Orbán based his re-election campaign on falsely accusing me of planning to flood Europe, Hungary included, with Muslim refugees,” Soros said."
2018-10-25T08:00:03Z,Is the US in an 'illegal' immigration crisis? Border patrol data suggests otherwise,"Donald Trump rails against an “onslaught of illegal aliens” possibly including MS-13 gang members and “Middle Easterners” poised to invade the US; news organizations cover the slow progress of a migrant caravan heading through Mexico as if it were a looming hurricane; humanitarian workers from California to Texas struggle to provide shelter for an unprecedented number of families released from border patrol holding cells. Going by the headlines of the day, you might be forgiven for thinking that the US is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis of illegal migration across its southern frontier. But illegal border crossings have declined significantly from record highs in the early years of the 21st century. According to the latest statistics from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), 396,579 undocumented people were apprehended after entering the country illegally in 2018. Another 124,511 people presented themselves at ports of entry, many seeking humanitarian protection, but immigration officials found them inadmissible. In 2000, however, more than 1.6 million illegal border crossers were apprehended. In 2001, the figure was 1.3 million. In the early 2000s, the largest group of undocumented migrants caught entering the US were Mexican men crossing to work. When caught, border patrol sent them back without long-term detention or court proceedings. Many crossed again and again and some eventually succeeded in evading border enforcement. The high apprehension numbers certainly include many individuals caught and counted more than once. Small ups and downs in the flow continued until a significant drop off at the end of the decade – from 556,041 in 2009 to 340,252 in 2011 – coinciding with the great recession, and the disappearance of the jobs many migrants came for. In the following years, apprehension numbers continued to fluctuate between 350,000-500,000, with a low of 310,531 in 2017. Observers attribute that steep decline to economic growth in Mexico, ramped-up border enforcement, and the “Trump effect”, which deterred some migrants. But as the numbers of Mexican immigrants decreased, more Central Americans – including unaccompanied teenagers, single parents with children and entire families – crossed the border, many of them fleeing conditions of extreme violence. Young people fled gang recruitment, persecution by police working with organized crime, and threats of rape and death. Mothers and fathers undertook the arduous journey to escape the dangers posed by corrupt officials, gangs and security forces. Families also fled conditions of extreme poverty, multiple crop failures exacerbated by climate change and moribund economies void of jobs. Unlike adults crossing the border looking for work, families with children and individuals seeking asylum cannot be deported quickly; asylum takes months and years in immigration court. Adults are often detained for the duration of the legal process, but current law forbids the government from detaining children for long periods. The government can detain families together, but it doesn’t have nearly enough space to hold all of the families now coming. CBP apprehension statistics released on Tuesday for fiscal year 2018 show steep increases in recent months – mostly families with children – a total of 16,658 people in September alone. Here on the border, Trump’s hardline rhetoric collides with the reality of thousands of refugee families already here who cannot be imprisoned indefinitely, nor can they be quickly removed, at least according to current law. Churches and other volunteers gladly shelter those set free because the government’s immigration prisons are full. Having failed to build his wall, Trump will ramp up construction of detention camps for families and children. Radical anti-immigrant bureaucrats in the executive branch will find new ways to criminalize refugees, separate children from parents, and deploy military personnel on the border. People will keep walking – and they will follow a northern star. Molly Molloy is a border and Latin America specialist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico"
2018-09-03T09:41:49Z,"Sharp rise in proportion of migrants dying in Mediterranean, says UN","Fewer people are making the journey across the Mediterranean to Europe, but the proportion of those losing their lives while trying has risen sharply, the UN refugee agency has said in its latest report. The UNHCR said 1,095 people died on the central Mediterranean route, mainly from Libya to Italy, between January and July this year, amounting to one death for every 18 arrivals. This compares with 2,276 last year, or one death for every 42 arrivals. In June, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals, the agency said, adding that there had been 10 incidents so far this year in which 50 or more people died, most of them after leaving Libya and seven of them since June. “The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,” said Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean. More than 300 people had also died so far in 2018 along the sea route from North Africa to Spain, the UNHCR said – a 50% increase on 2017, when 200 deaths were recorded for the whole year. In April, when more than 1,200 reached Spain by sea, the death rate was one in 14. “With the number of people arriving in Europe falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives,” UNHCR’s Europe bureau director, Pascale Moreau, said. Migration into Europe is down sharply from its 2015-16 peak, but the bloc remains divided over how to handle new arrivals. The interests of “frontline” southern states, such as Italy and Greece, are diametrically opposed to those of northern “destination” states, and some hardline, populist leaders are refusing to take any refugees at all. Italy’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has said his country will “no longer be Europe’s refugee camp”, and sparked a series of diplomatic rows by refusing to allow migrant rescue ships to dock in Italian ports unless other EU states agreed to take in those onboard. Salvini and the equally hardline Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said after meeting in Milan last week they were “walking down the same path” in opposing what they called the “pro-migration policies” of the European commission and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. The UN migration agency, IOM, has demanded a “predictable, regional approach” for the rescue and disembarkation of people recovered in the Mediterranean, and the UNHCR is calling for Europe to provide increased access to safe, legal pathways for refugees by boosting resettlement places and cutting obstacles to family reunification. Cochetel said Europe needed to come together and “take the lead”, avoiding anti-migrant rhetoric and understanding that numbers were sharply down and migrant flows manageable at current levels. The UNHCR also outlined the dangers refugees face travelling to or within Europe by land, saying 78 deaths had been recorded so far this year along land routes in Europe or at Europe’s borders, compared with 45 in the same period last year."
2018-12-20T18:04:24Z,Medical colleges criticise charging migrants upfront for NHS care,"Representatives of more than 70,000 doctors have urged ministers to suspend regulations that force hospitals to charge overseas visitors upfront for NHS care. Three royal medical colleges and one faculty say the charging regime is harming people’s health by deterring them from seeking NHS help when they fall ill. Payments in advance are “a concerning barrier to care”, they say. They have voiced particular concern about pregnant women being denied care and children missing out on treatment for life or death illnesses. Their plea is the strongest opposition yet from the medical community to hospitals in England being compelled to charge migrants up to tens of thousands of pounds before they treat them. The statement has been signed by the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Faculty of Public Health. They want Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, to suspend regulations brought in in 2015 and 2017 that specify when overseas visitors should be charged for receiving NHS care. Charges should not be enforced until a full independent review is undertaken of how they are affecting migrants’ access to healthcare, the four groups say. Citing evidence of mothers-to-be and children being left without medical aid, the colleges say: “We do not believe that regulations that lead to such situations are appropriate. They are having a direct impact on individual health and have potential implications for wider public health. “Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to improve patients’ outcomes and – in the case of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV – to protect public health.” Some patients have been wrongly charged because they could not prove they were entitled to free care, the statement adds. Charging migrants in advance for care threatens to weaken the bonds of trust that should exist between doctors and patients, the four groups say. “The role of doctors in this process has the potential to damage the vital trust between us and our patients, and is likely to lead to poorer outcomes and contribute to already low morale in our profession.” Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the British Medical Association and the former NHS England chief executive David Nicholson have all previously voiced their unease about the regulations. Groups campaigning against the charges, such as the health NGO Medact and Doctors of the World, welcomed the colleges’ move. “These short-sighted, poorly implemented policies around upfront charging are a step backwards in the fight for good public health and universal healthcare. Everyone has the right to healthcare, regardless of immigration status, and intimidating patients to stay away from hospital under the guise of cost-saving on the back of eight years of under-funding has no place in the NHS,” said Joanna Dobbin, a junior doctor and a member of Medact’s migrant solidarity group. Prof Shirley Hodgson, a cancer specialist, said the “harsh” charges were in breach of the NHS’s founding duty to provide universal healthcare. “It is unconscionable to ask health workers to act as gatekeepers for medical services, putting them in a position to decide who is eligible for healthcare and who is not,” she said."
2018-06-29T18:05:48Z,"EU's migrant centres could breach human rights, say campaigners","Secure migrant processing camps that may be set up in Europe under a deal reached by EU leaders risk becoming de facto detention centres breaching basic human rights, campaigners have said. The summit’s vaguely-worded conclusions after marathon talks in Brussels gave no details of what the “controlled centres” would look like or which states might volunteer to host them, but diplomats said they could resemble “improved versions” of existing – and heavily criticised – EU “hotspots” set up in Greece and Italy. “Rapid and secure processing” at the proposed EU-funded centres would allow economic migrants to be identified and returned home, the statement said, while those identified as “in need of international protection” would be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them “on the principle of solidarity”. Arrivals across the Mediterranean have fallen by more than 90% compared with 2015, but a political crisis has erupted across the bloc, with deep divisions emerging among member states about how to handle the problem. Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights programme director for Amnesty International, said the latest plan looked like “more of the same”. The proposals made the prospect of “lengthy and indefinite detention” look more likely, he said, in potential breach of EU and international law and the convention on human rights. Catherine Woollard, the secretary general of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, said her organisation’s prime concern was that the centres could become permanent detention hubs, particularly for migrants whose asylum claims have been rejected but cannot be returned. “We would also be concerned about them possibly becoming magnets for smuggling and trafficking groups,” she said, adding that some potential host countries the EU might approach, such as Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia or Serbia, had “serious problems” with organised crime. Further issues, including ensuring refugees’ rights to legal assistance and appeal, could arise if the EU gets into the business of processing asylum claims under EU asylum law in countries outside the EU or trying to join. The European commission introduced its controversial hotspots – intended as hubs where arrivals in so-called frontline states would be fingerprinted, identified, registered and moved on – as part of an effort to streamline the reception of asylum seekers at the height of the 2015 migration crisis. Ten centres, five in Italy and five in Greece, were opened, but EU member states failed to accept even a small fraction of the refugees they had pledged to take, so the centres rapidly turned into squalid, overcrowded camps. According to an official EU audit last year, migrants’ lives were plagued by a shocking lack of basic security, water, decent food, blankets and medical facilities. Sexual abuse and exploitation of the large numbers of unaccompanied minors in the camps was widespread, adding to concern about fundamental human rights violations including the deprivation of liberty. “In Greece, people have been held for a very long time, in terrible conditions, basically trapped and with no progress at all to resolve their asylum claim … or establish who is responsible for them,” Valdez-Symonds said. The Danish Refugee Council last year found evidence of a broad range of rights violations, including de facto detention. Humanitarian standards were branded appalling in some hotspots: the Moria camp in Lesbos, built to house 1,800 people, was holding 6,250 migrants and asylum seekers at one point, but only had one functioning latrine. Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, said on Friday after a five-day visit to Greece that the country must process asylum claims significantly faster and relocate asylum seekers from its islands, where many continue to live in cramped and dangerous conditions."
2018-08-28T18:19:30Z,Matteo Salvini and Viktor Orbán to form anti-migration front,"The Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, have said they are “walking down the same path” after discussing the formation of a common anti-migration front they said would oppose the policies of the French president. “We want to change Europe’s commission. We want to protect our borders. We are going to fight pro-migrant policies supported by [Emmanuel] Macron and [George] Soros,” Salvini said after the pair met in Milan. The talks between two of Europe’s most vocal hardline leaders followed a standoff with Brussels after Salvini prevented 177 asylum seekers disembarking from the coastguard ship Ubaldo Diciotti for almost a week as he called for guarantees that other EU member states would take most of them. After his request was refused, Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League, announced he would meet Orbán to discuss “alternative strategies”. “European elections are coming. We have to change a lot of things,” Orbán said on Tuesday. “There are two sides at the moment in Europe. One is led by Macron, who is supporting migration. The other one is supported by countries who want to protect their borders. Hungary and Italy belong to the latter.” It is not the first time Salvini has attacked the French president, who in turn has shown no sympathy for the Italian interior minister. Macron said in June that extremists in “neighbour” countries were betraying European values. Orbán, whom Salvini has described as a political role model, has been among the most hostile to immigration in Europe and appears to be a natural ally for Salvini. His Fidesz party was re-elected in April, promising to crack down on aid groups it said supported migrants. “Hungary has shown that we can stop migrants on land. Salvini has shown migrants can be stopped at sea. We thank him for protecting Europe’s borders,” Orbán said. “We must send migrants back to their countries. Brussels says we cannot do it. They also had said it was impossible to stop migrants on land, but we did it.” Despite sharing the same anti-migration platform, the two leaders appear to disagree on the relocation of asylum seekers. Salvini is pushing for their distribution among EU nations, whereas Orbán stands with Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in saying no. Orbán brushed off their differences before the meeting. “Me and Salvini, we seem to share the same destiny. He is my hero,” he told reporters. He again described Salvini as a “hero” after their talks, saying he “could win the elections in Hungary if he would decide to run”. Thousands of leftwing activists had gathered in Milan to protest against the two men. During the standoff over the Diciotti the Italian government threatened to suspend its EU budget contributions. Those stuck onboard were allowed to disembark on Saturday, with Ireland, Albania and Italy’s Catholic Church agreeing to take most of them. The European commission said threats were unhelpful and called on all countries to find a solution to help the people onboard. “The consequences of the Diciotti case and the way Italy is dealing with migration in general risks destabilising the equilibrium of a Europe that is still glued to its national interests,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “Italy has become a laboratory of European populism and risks moving away not only from Europe, but also from western democracies and getting closer, together with Orbán’s Hungary, to [Russia’s Vladimir] Putin, who enjoys Salvini’s manifestations of sympathy.” The meeting followed talks between the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and his Czech counterpart, Andrej Babiš, who has opposed relocating refugees and migrants. Conte would visit Moscow in October, Russian news agencies said on Tuesday. Salvini was placed under investigation last week by Italian prosecutors from Agrigento, Sicily, for potential abuse of office, kidnapping and illegal detention, relating to his refusal to allow those onboard the Diciotti to disembark. Their release will not stop the investigation into Salvini, who governs in coalition with the populist and anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after an election campaign this year in which he vowed to adopt tough polices on immigration. Salvini has repeatedly said Italy will “no longer be Europe’s refugee camp”, and as first evidence of the new government’s hardline approach closed all Italian seaports to rescue boats operated by non-government organisations in the Mediterranean."
2018-09-24T16:20:07Z,Italian government approves Salvini bill targeting migrants,"A series of hardline measures that will see the Italian government abolish key forms of protection for migrants and make it easier for them to be deported has been approved by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s cabinet. Drafted by Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister and leader of the League, the decree will also suspend the refugee application process of those who are considered “socially dangerous” or who have been convicted of a crime. Salvini, who has blocked NGO rescue ships from Italian ports to cut the number of migrants arriving in the country by sea, said the bill was a “step forward to making Italy safer”. He claimed it would also strengthen the fight against the mafia and people traffickers, give the police greater powers and “expel offenders and fake refugees”. Parliament has 60 days to debate and modify the decree before it becomes law. The plans include abolishing humanitarian protection, a form of protection for those not eligible for refugee status but who for various reason cannot be sent home, and replacing it with a special permits system that will limit eligibility to people such as victims of a natural disaster or those with a serious illness. Salvini pledged last week to stop giving permits to “crafty migrants not escaping war”. Christopher Hein, a professor of law and immigration policies at Luiss University in Rome, said the measures could have a dramatic impact on the lives of tens of thousands already in the country. The majority of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years have been granted humanitarian protection status, which is valid for two years and entitles them to a residency permit and enables them to work. “Far more people are on this permit than the number of recognised refugees – last year it was around 25% of all asylum seekers,” said Hein. Salvini’s move may, however, also lead to an increase in the number of irregular migrants. “If people do not have a chance to obtain this kind of protection, or they no longer make an attempt, or they get rejected, it does not mean that the next day they simply go home,” said Hein. “The ultimate aim is to have no refugees at all in Italy through a combination of efforts: closure of seaports, criminalising migrant rescue NGOs, enhancing collaboration with the coastguard and now, with this decree, they target those who are already here, or who may come in future and not get any kind of protection – it is a deterrent measure.” The plan to suspend the asylum requests of those considered “socially dangerous” could result in people being expelled on the basis of accusations of deviance rather than convictions. The decree did not include measures against the Roma community, although Salvini said he was in talks with the mayors of major cities to ensure that all camps were closed."
2018-12-05T19:08:54Z,Syrian aid worker who swam refugees to safety freed from Greek jail,"After 107 days of incarceration, Sarah Mardini – the Syrian human rights worker who saved 18 refugees in 2015 by swimming their waterlogged dinghy to the shores of Lesbos with her Olympian sister – has been freed from Greece’s toughest jail. The 23-year-old was released late on Wednesday from the high-security Koryallos prison in Athens, where she was being held in pre-trial detention on charges of people-smuggling. She was allowed to walk free after her lawyers posted €5,000 (£4,450) in bail. Sean Binder, a 24-year-old volunteer born in Germany and resident in Ireland, was also freed from custody in Chios along with two others from the NGO for which both had worked. “We are all incredibly happy, incredibly relieved,” said Dr Florian Becker, the managing director of Bard College in Berlin, where Mardini had been enrolled before her arrest in Lesbos in August. “But sadly this is not the end. While copious evidence has been produced to prove their innocence we still don’t know if the charges will be dropped against them.” Greece was strongly criticised by human rights groups following the aid workers’ arrests. Amnesty International and other organisations insisted the case embodied efforts to criminalise humanitarian work in a climate that has become increasingly hostile towards migrants and refugees across Europe. Mardini and Binder had faced prison sentences of up to 25 years after being accused of facilitating people-smuggling through membership of a criminal organisation. Charges of espionage and money laundering were also levelled at the activists. Both had been volunteering in search and rescue operations with the now-defunct Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI), an NGO based on Lesbos. In an unusually long statement following six months of inquiries, police said the activities amounted to “organised migrant trafficking rings” by people who had knowledge of “specific refugee flows”. Zaccharias Kesses, the lawyer heading the aid workers’ legal team in Athens, confirmed that Mardini would be free to return to Berlin, where her supporters have taken to the streets. Previously a judge had rejected appeals for the aid workers to be released, citing the risk of re-offending. “The release of all of them at the same time is proof that there is not enough evidence against them,” Kesses told the Guardian. “The arrests were clearly part of an organised plan to criminalise humanitarian aid and to a great degree it worked. Hundreds of volunteers have been discouraged and on Lesbos many have left. Their release today is a great success.” But Kesses said a trial was still likely to take place. “The charges may be amended but I think it very unlikely that the trial will be dropped. There is vast pressure in local society against NGOs, who are perceived to be pull factors for refugees at a time when few want them.” Although arrivals on Greek shores have abated since the peak of the migrant crisis at the height of Syria’s civil war, the influx has increased this year with growing numbers dying or being reported missing while attempting to reach Greece from Turkey in rickety boats crossing the Aegean Sea. Amnesty International’s Greece researcher Kondylia Gougou said: “Whilst we welcome the news that these dedicated humanitarians will be back with their families tonight after more than 100 days behind bars, the fact that they still face absurd charges and potentially long prison sentences is an outrage. To detain dedicated volunteer humanitarians who helped people in need defies logic … these baseless charges should be dropped.”"
2018-12-07T05:00:07Z,Vulnerable migrants made homeless after Italy passes 'Salvini decree',"Dozens of migrants, including victims of sex trafficking and a child with mental health problems, have been removed from so-called “welcome centres” in Italy as the populist government’s hardline immigration measures kick in. The “Salvini decree” – named after Matteo Salvini, interior minister and leader of the far-right League – won a vote in parliament last week and was formally endorsed by the president Sergio Mattarella on Monday. The main element of the bill, which abolishes humanitarian protection for those not eligible for refugee status but who cannot be sent home, was however retroactively applied by the interior ministry’s representative in Crotone, a province in the southern Calabria region, where last Friday 24 people were forced to leave a centre in the town of Isola Capo Rizzuto. The evictions are not only affecting those whose request for protection on humanitarian grounds is pending approval, but also those in possession of permits to stay, despite the law stipulating that their status should be maintained. The majority of migrants who have arrived in Italy in recent years have been granted humanitarian protection, with some 100,000 people estimated to hold the permit, which is valid for two years and enables them to work. Among those stranded in Isola Capo Rizzuto were a young couple with a five-month-old daughter, two victims of sex trafficking and a boy suffering from mental health problems. “When the police came to tell us that we couldn’t stay there anymore, I couldn’t believe my ears,” Blessing, a 31-year-old victim of sex trafficking from Nigeria, told the Guardian. “They took all of our belongings and escorted us out. There was a young girl in our group. This is outrageous. I have a legal permit to stay. And soon I may not have a roof over my head. I’m really frightened.” Blessing found temporary shelter in a Red Cross charity facility in Crotone while the rest have also been accommodated with the help of other charities and the town hall. “What happened here is crazy,” said Francesco Parisi, president of Crotone’s Red Cross. “You can’t just leave vulnerable people on the street. This is a violation of human rights. We are going to take care of these people now, but I hope things will change.” Alessia Romana, a social policies councillor in Crotone, said the local authority was trying to manage the situation. “The council has a moral obligation but also the juridical obligation to take care of these people,” she said. “Up until now, the system in Crotone worked well. We managed to give reception and there wasn’t any trouble; migrants and locals co-existed.” A similar measure was applied in Potenza, a city in the southern region of Basilicata, with the interior ministry prefect there announcing last week that “humanitarian protection holders” must be “invited to leave” welcome centres. Once humanitarian protection permits are received, people are supposed to leave centres on the first rung of the migrant reception system and move to an accommodation in which they can benefit from integration programmes. But slow-moving bureaucracy and limited space means that those with permits end up staying in the first-rung centres for longer. A dozen or so others have been asked to leave a welcome centre in Caserta, Campania, according to Italian press reports, while hundreds are expected to be evicted from Cara di Mineo, Europe’s second largest migrant reception centre, in the coming days. The number is likely to rise as the bill, which Salvini has described as a “gift to Italians”, takes effect. The loss of protection will also mean hundreds of people suddenly becoming “illegal” immigrants, with Italy’s national statistics office estimating that the decree will make 130,000 migrants illegal by 2020. “What we have been witnessing recently leads us to believe that there will be negative effects not only on vulnerable people, but also on Italian society generally as people enter into a formally illegal status,” said Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in southern Europe. “We fail to understand why, at this precise moment, even those individuals with legal protection have been told to leave. The decree is not retroactive, so why are they telling them to leave? Sending families away, women and children, pregnant women. It seems cruel.” Cities including Bologna, Turin and Rome, the latter two of which are managed by the Five Star Movement, the League’s coalition partner, have refused to implement the measures, arguing they will increase homelessness and risk social unrest. “We are really worried about a bill that is meant to manage immigration and increase security for citizens, but will instead create social marginality and destroy integration, while also creating social risks and the potential for radicalisation,” said Valeria Carlini, a spokesperson for the Italian Council for Refugees."
2018-12-19T18:11:07Z,UK and German immigration: a tale of two very different laws,"Two European countries announced radical overhauls of their immigration rules on Wednesday, but there the similarity ended. Britain, where concerns about long-term impacts of immigration helped drive the 2016 vote to leave the European Union, billed its stricter regime as “a route to strengthened border security and an end to free movement”. Germany, however, facing such a shortage of workers that is threatening economic growth, said it was easing immigration rules to attract more foreign job-seekers. In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the British home secretary, Sajid Javid, stressed that the Conservatives’ 2017 election manifesto had made clear the party’s “commitment to bring net migration down”. His counterpart in Germany, Horst Seehofer, said: “We need manpower from third countries to safeguard our prosperity and fill our job vacancies.” The economy minister, Peter Altmaier, hailed the new law – keenly awaited by business - as historic. Britain’s priority appears primarily to be establishing a system of tough controls capable of keeping certain people out. Business has accused the government of putting a political imperative for restriction before the needs of the economy. In contrast, by introducing looser visa procedures and reducing red tape Germany’s emphasis appears to be on making it easier for certain people to enter and to stay. Some in Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance and in the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have said such a move ignores public concerns about immigration. The UK’s system does not put a cap on numbers but aims to reduce annual net migration to “sustainable levels”. It requires skilled workers to earn a minimum salary, to be decided next year. After Brexit there would be no more special treatment for EU citizens; a transitional temporary worker scheme would allow them, and workers of any skill level from other “low risk” countries, to enter Britain without a job offer for up to 12 months. Business leaders have warned that the system will leave the UK poorer, depriving industry of a migrant workforce on which it has depended. The proposed £30,000 salary threshold for skilled workers would leave hospitals, the contstruction and hospitality sectors, manufacturing, agriculture and logistics desperately short of labour, they said. Germany’s Fachkräftezuwanderungsgesetz, or skilled labour immigration law, will allow skilled workers such as cooks, metallurgy workers and IT technicians to enter the country for six months to try to find a job, provided they can support themselves financially. More controversially, the law will offer the prospect of permanent residency to asylum seekers who have a job and speak good German but currently face deportation if their asylum applications are turned down. Immigration has been a key political issue in Germany since Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, when the country absorbed more than 1 million mostly Muslim refugees and migrants, sparking a xenophobic backlash and surge of support for the anti-immigration AfD in federal and regional elections. Ministers stressed the new rules were a “pragmatic solution” to a pressing economic problem. The AfD said they would fuel immigration, providing “a fresh incentive for people from around the world to come”. In Germany, however, those politics have not, so far, prevailed."
2018-12-27T12:43:22Z,Home Office tried to remove second migrant over Christmas period,"The Home Office attempted to remove from the UK a second vulnerable migrant over the Christmas period, the Guardian has learned. The 29-year-old woman, believed to be a victim of trafficking, was scheduled for removal by the Home Office on Boxing Day despite officials accepting she is at high risk of suicide. Her removal was deferred after her lawyer made urgent representations to the Home Office about the trafficking victim’s unfitness to fly. Her case followed that of the Congolese asylum seeker Otis Bolamu, 38, who was facing forced removal from the UK on Christmas Day. Bolamu’s removal was also deferred at the 11th hour after the Guardian reported his story, and following a petition launched by his supporters. The 29-year-old woman was trafficked from South America and detained in Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre after she was found to be working illegally. She disclosed that she had been trafficked and had been forced to hand over her wages to her trafficker, but due to minor inconsistencies in her account the Home Office rejected her trafficking case. The Home Office accepted that the woman is an “adult at risk” and placed her on constant suicide watch. Officials also placed her in segregation. However, despite the concerns about her mental health she was due to be removed back to her home country on Wednesday. Medical notes from Yarl’s Wood state that the woman’s “accounts of events are consistent with her scars and she could be a victim of torture”. She was assessed by an independent psychiatrist who found her to be in a state of “severe mental distress” and “at significant risk of suicide”. He said that she was not fit to fly. Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who is representing both the woman and Bolamu, expressed concern about the Home Office’s practice of removing vulnerable people during the festive season, when they are less likely to be able to access legal advice that could stop their removals. Bolamu was imprisoned and tortured by government agents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a result of his opposition to the government of Joseph Kabila. He had been living in Home Office accommodation in Swansea and volunteering at an Oxfam shop. He was seized in a dawn raid at about 4am last Thursday and, after first being held in Bridgend, was taken to Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick. Bell said: “The Home Office attempted to remove a potential victim of trafficking and domestic abuse who was segregated due to her active self-harm and suicidal ideation to the country where she was horrendously exploited. She was totally confused and terrified of returning, so much that she planned to take her own life. “The policy of Christmas removals is one that severely impedes full and entitled representation. We struggle to see how arresting Otis Bolamu in a dawn raid at 4am on 19 December and telling him that he was to be returned on Christmas Day can be considered reasonable and proportionate action. We are very happy removal was deferred and we will have time to work on his further submissions. “The holidays are supposed to be a time for joy and togetherness, not for the Home Office to take advantage to try to forcibly remove individuals to countries where they are fearful of return.” ﻿A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection. All asylum claims lodged in the UK are carefully considered on their individual merits against a background of relevant case law and up-to-date country information.”"
2018-12-02T04:14:37Z,Setback for Australian refugee football player arrested in Thailand,"A refugee football player who was hoping to return to Australia over the weekend after being arrested in Thailand has been put into detention instead and is facing deportation to the country he fled from. Hakeem Al-Araibi was arrested at Bangkok airport last week on an Interpol notice issued at Bahrain’s request. The 25-year-old told SBS News on Sunday that Thai authorities “discreetly” ordered him to book a flight out of the country. He booked a flight to Melbourne departing Saturday at 9pm. But three hours before the flight he was told he would not be flying to Australia and was taken to Bangkok’s immigration detention centre. Al-Araibi’s lawyer, Latifa Al-Haouli, told SBS News that authorities from the Bahraini government and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs were “pleading their cases” in regard to his detention. “I haven’t heard of Hakeem yet as of this morning. We’ve been told that Dfat is doing all that they can but I think they need to be doing more,” she said. The Bahraini embassy in Thailand issued statements on Twitter on Sunday saying they were “following up with the relevant security authorities” and that “the suspect is wanted for security cases”. Last week Al-Araibi told Guardian Australia he was arrested on an Interpol red notice for his conviction over an act of vandalism in Bahrain which he denies and says allegedly happened while he was playing in a televised football game. Since 2015 Interpol has said it would not allow red notices against confirmed refugees and asylum seekers from the countries they fled from. “When I arrived at immigration in Thailand they took me to detention and said you have a red notice from Bahrain,” he said from detention. “I told them I am a refugee in Australia. I said [Bahrain] is not allowed to take me … I have been in Australia for four-and-a-half years now. But they took me to detention.” Al-Araibi arrived in Australia in 2015 and was granted refugee status and permanent residency three years later. A former member of Bahrain’s national football team, he has previously described being tortured and beaten by authorities who had accused him and other football players of setting fire to a police station, and he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in jail. Al-Araibi denies the charge and claims he was playing in a televised football match at the time of the alleged incident. The players and their families are believed to have been targeted for their involvement in peaceful protests against the ruling family during the Arab Spring of 2011. A number of the players targeted alongside Al-Araibi were also reportedly granted refuge in Australia, where Al-Araibi now plays for a Melbourne team. He has since publicly spoken against Sheikh Salman Alkhalifa, cousin of the Bahraini king and current president of the Asian Football Confederation, doing multiple interviews with media while Alkhalifa campaigned for the presidency of Fifa. Last week a spokeswoman for Dfat told Guardian Australia: “Australian embassy officials in Bangkok are in direct contact with Thai authorities regarding this issue. Owing to our privacy obligations we will not provide further comment.” Al-Araibi’s support team have expressed concern that he would get less assistance from the Australian government because he is not a citizen, and called for urgent action to prevent his deportation to Bahrain. “I spoke to someone from the Australian embassy in Thailand. She said just wait for immigration in Thailand because she sent them more information,” said Al-Araibi. He said he checked with Australian and Thai authorities before leaving, and both had assured him of his safety. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said: “Interpol has violated its obligations, as Hakeem holds refugee status and returning him to Bahrain puts him at significant risk of torture and imprisonment. “His deportation would undoubtedly damage the reputation of Interpol’s newly elected president early into his tenure.”"
2018-10-24T17:29:25Z,The Guardian view on the migrant convoy: a heroic journey | Editorial,"The six or seven thousand people – men, women, and children – who have set out to walk 3,000 miles through Mexico to reach the US are brave, resourceful and determined to better themselves. They might become the kind of citizens that every country needs and whose support any politician should be proud of. Naturally, they are objects of loathing for President Trump, a man whose entire life has been cushioned by privilege. He has done his best to exploit their misery in advance of the midterm elections, claiming that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” are mixed in with them. There have been many such caravans before now, and there will be many afterwards. They are a natural reaction to the difficulties and dangers that lone travellers, especially women and children, face when they attempt to reach the prosperous world. The wise and sensible thing to do would be to treat them as an opportunity to manage migration – but the nativist reaction is to treat them as a giant jailbreak. For Mr Trump and, indeed, for some other western policymakers, the function of poor countries is to keep poor people locked up. Aid to the Central American countries from which the caravan has fled is conditional on their “doing the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the US” to quote another of his presidential tweets. This view of Central America as a prison colony is grimly reflected in the US justice system. Many experts point out that the chaos in Central America can in part be attributed to the mass deportation of gang members and suspected gang members from the US, whether or not they grew up there. These gangs originated inside the Californian prison system and among its clientele on the outside. They are not native to the countries they are now destroying. It is their victims who are fleeing on foot to the US. The murder rate in parts of Honduras is the highest anywhere in the world outside of war zones. Much of this violence is fuelled by drugs, and the money from the drug trade, which also comes in the last analysis from the US. The idea that these countries and their inhabitants can be walled off from US politics, and the US economy, is a poisonous fantasy. But it has served Mr Trump well and he will continue to exploit it. In theory there is a policy of enlightened self-interest that would help to mitigate the worst effects of this traffic. Sufficient aid to the countries from which they come would help to enable the development of both the economy and the kind of security and access to justice that they desperately need. This was the policy pursued under the Obama administration, which Mr Trump is now demolishing. Since 2015, “addressing the root causes of migration” has also been a key theme of official EU strategy. As a means of stemming the flow of refugees this will be effective only in the long term. Civil societies grow over time. They can’t be prefabricated abroad and helicoptered into place like disaster housing. But increasing aid to help stabilise societies is a policy still worth pursuing, though care must be taken not to undermine poorer countries’ ownership of development policies. In the meantime, these caravans should be treated as the humanitarian emergency they are, and their inhabitants welcomed for their courage and spirit."
2018-10-19T15:36:31Z,Trump baselessly claims Democrats are behind migrant caravan,"Donald Trump thrust a caravan of migrants heading toward the US border into the midterm election campaign, saying at a rally on Thursday night that the race will be “an election of the caravan”. A group that now numbers about 3,000 people has left Honduras and has reached Guatemala’s border with Mexico, with the ultimate goal of reaching the US – infuriating Trump. “It’s going to be an election of the caravan. You know what I’m talking about,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Missoula, Montana, declaring his intention to use the migrants’ journey as a bludgeon against Democratic candidates. There is evidence that Trump’s use of the caravan as a campaign issue may be effective among the Republican base. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 75% of voters who intend to vote for a Republican congressional candidate consider illegal immigration a “very big” problem for the country. That makes it the top-rated issue for Republican leaning voters. By contrast, only 19% of voters supporting a Democrat called illegal immigration a very big problem. Democratic voters instead called gun violence, the affordability of healthcare and college education, government ethics, the gap between the rich and poor, and a host of other issues very big problems. Trump claimed, without any supporting evidence, that Democrats were behind the caravan, and raised conspiracy theories that the Central Americans had been paid to come to the United States for political reasons. “Now we’re starting to find out – and I won’t say it 100%, I’ll put a little tiny question mark at the end. But we’re probably not going to need it, but we have the fake news back there,” he told the crowd, adding a familiar jab at news reporters covering his campaign appearances. “A lot of money’s been passing through people to come up and try to get to the border by election day, because they think that’s a negative for us. Number one, they’re being stopped. And number two, regardless, that’s our issue.” Trump appeared to be referring to a video posted by the Florida representative Matt Gaetz, which he claimed showed women and children being given cash to “storm the US border @ election time”. He suggested without evidence that the source could be “Soros? US-backed NGOs?” referring to George Soros, an American billionaire who is the frequent subject of rightwing conspiracy theories. A journalist who interviewed people on the ground where the video was taken reported that local merchants had collected money and given it out as aid to migrants. He located the site in Guatemala, not Honduras as the congressman had claimed. Gaetz later posted a tacit correction, saying he had believed the video was taken in Honduras because it was sent to him by a Honduran official. Speaking of Democrats, Trump said: “They wanted that caravan. And there are those who say that caravan didn’t just happen. It didn’t just happen.” Trump threatened on Thursday to close the US-Mexico border and deploy the military if caravan members approach the frontier. The Mexican government said it was in touch with members of the caravan, some of whom have arrived at the country’s southern border seeking refuge, and will process any legitimate claims for entry in an orderly manner. Mexican officials have said that anyone who enters illegally will be subject to deportation. Despite the extremist campaign trail rhetoric, the Trump administration has supported a Mexican government plan to work with the United Nations refugee agency to deal with the caravan, USA Today reported. The Mexican government plans to ask the UN high commissioner for refugees for help identifying legitimate asylum claims from migrants in the group. Those whose claims are rejected will be deported to their home countries. The Illinois representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat, slammed Trump’s stance on the caravan, as well as his support for the Honduran president’s regime, which she said has worsened already dire conditions in the country. “These people have faced the worst of the worst – gang violence, economic desperation, natural disasters, extreme poverty and in some cases, state-sanctioned violence and intimidation,” she said. “President Juan Orlando Hernández’s corrupt government has made what was already an uphill climb for impoverished Hondurans impossibly steep. President Trump and the state department have supported his government every step of the way, even going against the will of the Organization of American States to legitimize his illegitimate election.” Schakowsky continued: “Instead of admitting some responsibility in creating the violent situation in Honduras, President Trump is yet again scapegoating immigrants and refugees. He is painting a picture of this migrant caravan as a threat to our national security instead of the desperate group of refugees that they are.”"
2018-06-24T08:57:24Z,EU leaders' migration summit offers lifeline to embattled Merkel,"EU leaders gather for an emergency summit on migration on Sunday, with the aim of shoring up Angela Merkel’s government. The informal “mini-summit”in Brussels is seen as a lifeline for the German chancellor, whose CDU party is involved in a bitter dispute over refugee policy with its conservative sister party in Bavaria, the CSU. Following a row with Italy about the purpose of the meeting, Merkel is downplaying expectations. “The meeting on Sunday is a consultation and working meeting at which there will be no concluding statement,” she said. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, agreed to go to Brussels only after Merkel abandoned a set of pre-written conclusions. A pre-cooked summit communique that emerged last week angered Conte, who said it neglected the “emergency” of migrant arrivals in Italy. Migration has become a political football in Germany and Italy, despite a sharp drop in the number of arrivals. About 41,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2018, and 960 people are confirmed or suspected to have died, according to the latest data from the International Organisation for Migration. The arrival figures are 51% down on last year and 81% down on 2016. The issue has shaken Merkel’s government after the hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who is also the CSU leader, set a two-week deadline for her to come up with a policy to deal with asylum claimants arriving in Germany from other EU member states. Udo Bullmann, a German Social Democrat MEP, accused the CSU of provoking a crisis to bolster its chances in the state election this autumn. “The Bavarian CSU is doing what they always do when the face a crisis, they are organising a crisis with their sister party,” said Bullmann, the leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament. “They are frightened of losing their absolute majority. They see they are declining in numbers, so they think ‘where is my conflict with Berlin, where is my conflict with Brussels’. But in the real world, games can get out of control.” The summit guest list started with eight countries, but the leadersof 17 member states were expected to attend. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced his country and three other central European states would boycott the meeting, although none was expected or obliged to attend. Marta Foresti, the director of the Overseas Development Institute, said the EU was “in disarray on migration and the probability of reaching EU-wide consensus is at an all-time low”. “With the number of arrivals significantly decreased, but a higher proportion of those migrants dying during their journeys, taking concrete steps to address the reality of migration from Africa to Europe could not be more manageable and at the same time more urgent,” she said."
2018-10-15T22:57:17Z,"'Yes, we can': caravan of 1,600 Honduran migrants crosses Guatemala border","A group of more than 1,600 Honduran migrants who are attempting to reach the US border overland have crossed into with Guatemala – despite warnings that they would be turned away at the border. Singing the Honduran national anthem, praying and chanting, “Yes, we can,” the group, who say they are fleeing violence and poverty, crossed the border on Monday afternoon and headed towards the city of Esquipulas. “We are not criminals, we are migrants,” said Keilin Umana, a pregnant nurse who told the Associated Press that she had fled her home after receiving death threats from gang members. The migrant caravan set off from the city of San Pedro Sula on Friday, the day after the US vice-president, Mike Pence, urged the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home. “Tell your people: don’t put your families at risk by taking the dangerous journey north to attempt to enter the United States illegally,” said Pence at a regional security event in Washington DC. The Guatemalan government, which is seeking US support in its controversial attempt to shut down the UN-backed crime fighting force investigating the president and his close allies for corruption, pledged to comply with Pence’s demands and halt the mass migration. In a statement, the country’s Institute of Migration (IGM) condemned the migrant caravan as illegal, and vowed to stop the migrants from crossing its border: “Guatemala does not promote or endorse irregular migration in any forms, [and] therefore rejects movements organized for unlawful purposes which distort human rights, like migration, for their own end.” About 100 Guatemalan police officers met the caravan at the border, but after a tense standoff of about two hours, the migrants began walking again. The migrant caravan has swelled from 160 to 1,600 since setting out last week from San Pedro Sula, which has become one of the world’s most dangerous cities thanks to a toxic combination of gang and state-sponsored violence, corruption and impunity. Jari Dixon, a Honduran congressman, tweeted: “They are not seeking the American dream – they’re fleeing the Honduran nightmare.” The group includes dozens of families with infants and children who hope travelling in numbers will reduce the risk posed by criminal gangs that prey on vulnerable migrants. The passage through Mexico is one of the world’s most perilous migration corridors. This is the second Central American migrant caravan this year. In April, Donald Trump threatened to cut foreign aid after hundreds of people, mainly Hondurans, applied for asylum in the US. Since then, thousands of Central American children have been separated from their parents at the US border as part of an anti-immigration crackdown. But rampant violence and poverty in Central America continues to force people to abandon their homes in search of safety and jobs. Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world, despite official figures that claim a record-breaking drop in murder rates. Two-thirds of Hondurans live in poverty, with remittances accounting for a fifth of the country’s GDP."
2018-12-21T16:54:06Z,"Guardian and Observer charity appeal passes £500,000 in a fortnight","The 2018 Guardian and Observer appeal supporting five charities that helped to bring the Windrush scandal to light has raised more than £500,000 in a fortnight. The charities provide legal assistance, advice, advocacy – and often welfare support – for migrants and UK citizens facing injustice, homelessness and destitution caused by “hostile environment” immigration policies. The total raised so far includes £45,000 pledged by readers during the appeal telethon last Saturday, when journalists including Marina Hyde, Gary Younge, Owen Jones, Polly Toynbee and Katharine Viner were on hand to take donations. The appeal remains open until 6 January. Guardian reader Bela, who arrived in the UK from Kenya with her family in 1968 when she was a child, said her own experiences inspired her to give to donate: “This country welcomed me and now it’s my turn to welcome others.” Arten Llazari, the chief executive of Refugee and Migrant Centre, one of the charities, said: “The success of the appeal is another demonstration of the profound decency of the British public and the way it cares for the vulnerable and marginalised.” The five appeal charities are: Praxis Community Projects; Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI); Refugee and Migrant Centre Black Country and Birmingham (RMC); the Runnymede Trust; and Law Centres Network. Many individuals whose heartbreaking stories were revealed by the Guardian’s award-winning coverage of the Windrush scandal were supported directly by our charities. Their work ensured clients were not unjustly deported and detained, and in some cases received the vital NHS treatment wrongly denied to them. According to the charities, the injustices are continuing, despite the government’s acknowledgement of the problems caused to citizens with a Caribbean background. They anticipate similar problems for EU migrants post-Brexit. Satbir Singh, JCWI’s chief executive, said: “I would like to thank everyone for their generous donations. The money raised will help us respond to this crisis by doubling the amount of free legal advice we are able to offer vulnerable individuals and families, reaching out into communities to provide vital support and build the kind of early warning systems that could prevent another Windrush from happening.” Please donate to our appeal here."
2018-12-18T14:42:28Z,Greek police accused of beating migrants trying to enter from Turkey,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) has released footage of men bearing prominent scars on their backs as it accused Greek police of inflicting beatings on migrants and asylum seekers illicitly entering the country across the land border from Turkey. The US-based group said the injuries depicted in the footage, shot in Edirne in Turkey in August, were sustained during attacks by Greek police engaged in alleged “pushbacks” of people in the north-eastern Evros region. Masked men wearing uniforms with no identifiable insignia had participated in the abuse, according to HRW. Separately, asylum seekers interviewed in Greece and Turkey described how they were stripped of their clothes and shoes and forced back across the frontier in freezing temperatures at night, often in little more than their underwear. Women, including a pregnant 19-year-old from Syria’s Afrin region, were among those forcibly returned to Turkey, it was revealed. “People who have not committed a crime are detained, beaten, and thrown out of Greece without any consideration for their rights or safety,” said the group’s Europe researcher, Todor Gardos. “The Greek authorities should immediately investigate the repeated allegations of illegal pushbacks.” There was no immediate comment from Greek police or government officials, although accusations of summary returns have been vehemently rejected in the past. But the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) supported the claims of systematic pushbacks, saying it was deeply concerned by them. “We continue to receive a significant number of credible reports of informal forced returns to Turkey through the Evros region,” said Leo Dobbs, the agency’s spokesman in Athens. “Such reports are of deep concern to UNHCR. We have on many occasions shared these concerns with the Greek authorities and urged investigation of incidents and measures to prevent this.” The state’s response, he said, had failed to ensure effective access to asylum and protection from forced returns of those who needed it most. International organisations have recorded an abrupt surge in numbers crossing the heavily militarised land border. The EU border agency, Frontex, estimates arrivals rose by 203% in the region between January and October. For the first time ever, land crossings exceeded sea crossings to Aegean islands in April, when 3,600 crossed the fast-flowing Evros River as entries peaked. Most making the treacherous journey are Turks claiming political persecution at home. However, HRW said its findings were based on interviews with people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia and Yemen. As winter has set in there have been reports of people dying of hypothermia as they attempt to make the crossings in Evros. Unlike Aegean islands, the land border is not affected by the controversial accord agreed in March 2016 between the EU and Turkey in a bid to staunch what were then massive flows into the bloc. Once in Greece, asylum seekers are able to move freely around the mainland, in sharp contrast to the islands where they are forced to remain often in deplorable conditions. HRW said it had put its findings to the Hellenic police director, Georgios Kossioris, who had not only categorically denied the pushbacks, but pledged that any incidents of misconduct, or violation of migrants’ and asylum seekers’ rights, would be thoroughly investigated."
2019-11-30T19:00:43Z,"When refugees in Libya are being starved, Europe’s plan is working | Kenan Malik","A hospital that finds its patients so burdensome that it denies them medical care. A homeless hostel that turfs its residents out on the streets. A refugee agency that refuses to provide food for those under its care. All might seem implausible. Except that there are credible reports that the third scenario is playing out in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a body that, as its name suggests, is entrusted with the care and protection of refugees. Yet it is apparently trying to shut down a centre that it opened just last year, and to “starve out” the people still inside to force them to leave. The UNHCR’s actions, if the reports are true, are scandalous. They are also unsurprising. Starving refugees out of a place of safety is a fair metaphor for western policy towards unwanted migrants. The EU, in particular, has been adept at using suffering as a policy lever. Central to the EU’s strategy over the past decade has been the outsourcing of immigration control, paying countries from Libya to Sudan, from Niger to Turkey, to deter potential migrants to Europe. In this process a new form of imperialism is emerging, whereby rich nations, in the name of protecting their borders from migrants, trample all over the borders of poorer neighbours. Niger, on the southern edge of the Sahara, is now, in the words of one European ambassador, “the southern border of Europe”. Whereas immigration controls are usually about stopping people entering a country illegally, the new imperialism requires African nations to prevent people leaving their territory if they might be coming to Europe. It’s the 21st century’s version of the Berlin Wall slung across the African continent. What is really being outsourced, as Mali’s former presidential candidate Aminata Traoré observes, is “violence and instability”. Europe has turned migrants into commodities to be haggled over in a brutal new marketplace. It presents its policies as “a response to criminality”, a recent report on EU strategy notes, but in reality it is “fuelling predatory and criminal behaviour by generating perverse incentives in ‘partner’ countries”. The EU does not particularly care who its “partners” are, so long as they willing to stop migrants reaching the Mediterranean. Sudan’s former president, Omar al-Bashir, overthrown in a military coup this year, has been indicted by the international criminal court for war crimes in Darfur. His regime was part of the “Khartoum process”, an EU initiative to cut off the migrant route from the Horn of Africa. One of the most effective instruments in policing migrants is Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries. Until 2013 they were known as the Janjaweed, a vicious militia that pursued almost genocidal violence in Darfur. Earlier this year, the RSF was responsible for massacres against anti-government protesters in Khartoum. It also plies its trade on behalf of the EU. Nor does the EU particularly worry about whom its “partners” lock up, so long as they lock up potential migrants to Europe. In the Sahel, 80% of migration is not to Europe but is regional, involving people who for decades have moved around an area in which borders are naturally porous. Militias and security forces don’t care to sift through different kinds of migrants, so all become targets for the new kidnap and detention industry. The result is the disruption of traditional trade routes, growing economic instability and rising discontent – feeding the desire for migration. The EU turns a blind eye to the treatment of detainees, too. European governments are not just aware of the torture, sexual abuse and extortion to which detainees are subject but also, in the words of Amnesty International’s John Dalhuisen, “complicit in these abuses”. The whole point of outsourcing is to pay others to do Europe’s dirty work. The more hostile the climate for migrants in countries such as Libya or Niger, the more effective the policy of keeping migrants away from Europe. The consequences of EU migration policy should, as the charity Médecins Sans Frontières puts it, “shock the collective conscience of Europe’s citizens and elected leaders”. Yet it is barely discussed. For those hostile to immigration, it’s a price worth paying. For liberals, it’s a touchy issue, for they fear feeding hostility to the EU. For Brussels, the policy is a political success. For dictators and warlords, it’s a means to riches and power. And so, the biggest scandal of our time has become an outrage that dare not speak its name. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
2019-11-20T12:47:55Z,Greece to replace island refugee camps with 'detention centres',"Greece has announced plans to close its three largest migrant camps and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners have likened to detention centres. People living in overcrowded camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos will be moved to closed complexes for identification, relocation and deportation with a capacity of at least 5,000 people each. More than 27,000 people are currently housed on the three islands – which have a nominal capacity of just 4,500 – under conditions that have been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe. “Decongesting the islands is a priority at this stage,” said Alkiviadis Stefanis, Greece’s deputy defence minister. Smaller camps on the islands of Kos and Leros will be remodelled along similar lines and enlarged, Stefanis added. The changes come with winter approaching and hundreds of families sleeping in tents outside official facilities on the five islands. Asylum seekers will not be allowed to move freely in and out of the camps, said officials, but will instead be locked up until they are either granted refugee status and relocated to the mainland or rejected and sent back to Turkey. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum-seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. The new conservative government, which came to power in July, has already passed a law stiffening asylum requirements for migrants, and has pledged to deploy additional border patrols. Stefanis said the operations of NGO groups that assist migrants would be subject to new criteria. “Only those (NGOs) that meet the requirements will stay and continue to operate in the country,” said Stefanis. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, this week accused the EU of treating countries on the bloc’s external frontiers as convenient places to park migrants. “It cannot go on like this,” Mitsotakis told the German newspaper Handelsblatt. “Europe regards arrival countries such as Greece as a convenient parking spot for refugees and migrants. Is that European solidarity? No. I will no longer accept this.” The International Organization for Migration last month said that Greece’s mainland camps are already nearly full or past capacity."
2019-10-21T05:00:35Z,'When home won't let you stay': artwork addressing global migration,"“You only run for the border when you see the whole city running as well,” writes Warsan Shire, a Somali-British poet in her poem, Home. Another line from the poem, “When home won’t let you stay,” is the title of a new exhibition opening 23 October at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. Featuring 40 artworks created by 20 key artists, When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art looks at how displacement, migration and immigration has inspired the works of artists over the past 20 years. The pieces tell some of the stories of the 70.8 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, according to a United Nations Refugee Agency statistic. “This isn’t a survey on the complicated topic of migration, displacement and immigration of people,” said co-curator Eva Respini. “Instead, we wanted to have a focused look through this moment right now. It’s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.” The first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It’s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled; from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes. “Over the years, I’ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,” said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. “Even though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,” she adds. The Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it’s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls “a memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee”. The Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots. Also on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016. The Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. “It tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,” said Respini. One of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. “The site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,” said Erickson. The Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003. Today, this part of the Mediterranean sea, the Strait of Gibraltar is the route to the south of Spain’s Andalusia region, which sees more migrant arrivals than anywhere else in Europe, making it especially timely. The Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra is showing works from her Almerisa series, which sees her photographing a Bosnian refugee woman over the course of 14 years, first as a child, and now as a mother. There’s also a new site-specific, community project by the Boston-based artist Anthony Romero, who collaborated with the immigrant community in east Boston. “He did a series of listening sessions, which are immigration stories,” said Erickson. “These audio recordings are a kind of community archiving for east Boston residents, story sharing.” It’s no coincidence that the museum overlooks the Boston harbor, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s a big theme that comes out of our desire to think about our museum site-specifically,” said Respini. “We’re perched on the Boston harbor, and everyone who visits us can see a dramatic view on top of the water. We’re dealing with perilous crossings over sea, a middle passage, we thought it felt right for our building, it’s so prevalent today.” When Home Won’t Let You Stay: Migration Through Contemporary Art is on show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston from 23 October to 26 January"
2019-11-03T15:15:52Z,Outrage in Calais over death of Nigerian man in tent,"Aid groups have protested over “inhuman” conditions for migrants and refugees sleeping rough in Calais after a 25-year-old Nigerian man died from smoke inhalation in his tent. He had tried to light a fire in a tin to keep warm and prepare food. Police in Pas-de-Calais confirmed that a man had died from intoxication from smoke fumes at the end of last week and said an autopsy would take place. The man was the third migrant or refugee to die in Calais this year. Aid groups reacted angrily and joined leftwing opposition parties in protesting against a recent decree by the rightwing mayor of Calais aimed at stopping migrants from gathering in the town centre during cultural festivities planned for this month. Charities said the decree had limited their ability to distribute food to migrants and refugees sleeping rough. “This death is really symbolic at a time where the local authorities have sought to remove migrants as well as the volunteers who help them from the town centre for supposed reasons of public order,” said François Guennoc of the aid group l’Auberge des Migrants. The decree was signed in part to coincide with a Calais street festival this weekend. Several political parties including the Greens, the Socialist party and France Unbowed said it denied migrants “their humanity and labels them as parasites that have to be hidden or walled in”. Since the closure of a makeshift migrant camp in Calais in October 2016, hundreds of people have been sleeping rough along the coast in squalid conditions, many without proper access to sanitation. Charities estimate that between 400 and 500 migrants and refugees are currently in Calais hoping to cross to the UK. The majority are from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Sudan Antoine Nehr, a coordinator for Utopia 56, which helps migrants and refugees in Calais, said conditions were “disgraceful and inhuman”. “People are being kept in such precarious conditions that unfortunately result in too many deaths,” he said."
2019-12-29T17:11:15Z,Most Britons weren’t hostile to migrants | Letters,"Kavita Puri, like so many others before her, talks about the racism faced by immigrant communities when they first arrived in large numbers during the 1960s (They came from south Asia to help build Britain. The racism they saw then is back, 20 December). This does great injustice to the vast majority of British people who went out of their way to help the new migrants to settle. They volunteered to teach English, teachers paid extra attention to immigrant children, health service staff treated the frail and elderly with utmost compassion. As an example, the city of Leicester accommodated tens of thousands of people fleeing Uganda. The Conservative government of Ted Heath did a remarkable job in settling those expelled from Idi Amin’s regime. Employers took in the new arrivals with little grasp of English and let them flourish. A huge number of people from the Indian subcontinent and east Africa ventured into business and prospered. The new generation born in this country have achieved beyond anyone’s imagination. They have broken many glass ceilings. Yes, you will occasionally get abuse thrown at you or there will be disagreeable people in all walks of life, but how can that be representative of the whole country? On the other hand, minorities can also have faults, and it remains their responsibility to join the mainstream. They have to respect the ethos and nuances of the people of the country they find themselves living in. While not denying that there were, and are, issues, the narrative that total hostility prevails does not stand up to scrutiny. Nitin Mehta Croydon, London • It is certainly worthwhile for fans to take a lead on football racism (Letters, 27 December), but if we are serious about getting rid of racism, it is far too late in people’s lives and much more difficult to do this. Racism does not come out of nowhere. Research over 50 years shows it is learned at an early age, long before children go to school. So in our deeply entrenched racist society, unless what surrounds children is positive about taking action to counter this racism, it is likely that they will reflect this. Much of our media, society and education system deny and even ridicule this. Consequently, little is done until it is far too late, when long-held attitudes are much more difficult to unlearn. In football, on the streets and in political discourse, such racism festers. Unless we face the facts about the early age that racism is learned, we’ll continue to have pleas for someone to do something about it when it rears its ugly head.

2019-10-23T18:21:26Z,Essex lorry deaths: how dangerous is the journey to the UK?,"Where did the 39 people who were found dead in a lorry container come from? We don’t know yet. Police were clear on Wednesday that they were some way from identifying them or confirming their point of origin. The only detail they provided of the victims initially was that 38 were adults and one was a teenager. Throughout the day, information emerged that might provide clues as to where the victims were picked up. Initially police thought that the container had come to the UK via Holyhead on Saturday and said: “We believe the lorry is from Bulgaria.” But later the force said it now believed that the trailer had travelled from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, while the cab had come from Northern Ireland separately. The Bulgarian government said that the lorry was registered in the coastal city of Varna under the name of a female Irish citizen. While it was not clear that either the cabin or the trailer had begun their journey there, the hypothesis that the victims travelled along the Balkan migrant route remained a possibility. Where does Bulgaria sit on the Balkan migrant route? Every day, hundreds of asylum seekers from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran attempt the cross the Balkan route to reach western Europe. The majority of them arrive in Bulgaria, having travelled through Turkey. From there, they try to cross Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, hoping to reach Slovenia, a Schengen country, before heading on to Italy, Austria or Germany. What are conditions like in the Balkans? Migrants often face brutal beatings within Balkan countries and as they cross borders. Setting off in groups, they attempt to cross under cover of night, trying to avoid police, armed with truncheons, pistols and night-vision goggles. If captured, migrants are often illegally pushed back, only to try again the next day. Informal camps are dotted along the Balkan borders, such as the one in Bihać in Bosnia, where migrants sleep in tents or under plastic and cardboard for a few nights. Migrants who have experienced the camps run by the Bulgarian government say asylum seekers are repeatedly abused and assaulted by the police. Since eastern European countries, such as Hungary, have closed their borders, crossings have become increasingly hazardous for migrants. Often, the only way to continue the journey is on lorries and trucks managed by smugglers. What are the recent developments? Last month, the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, drew attention to a significant rise in illegal crossings. Borissov said that on 20 September, 440 migrants had been detained after crossing the Turkish border by 11am alone. Greece is dealing with a similar situation. Meanwhile, local authorities in Bosnia have temporarily cut the water supply in Vucjak camp, near the city of Bihać, to force the central government to relocate migrants and refugees living there. Police have also removed dozens of asylum seekers from trains to prevent them from reaching camps that are overcapacity in the north-west of the country. Thousands of migrants are stuck near the border with Croatia, an EU member state. The Bihać Red Cross has warned of a building humanitarian crisis. How many people have died in transit? Since 2014 the International Organization for Migration has recorded the number of people who have died in transit. In the past six years, figures show more than 33,700 deaths. This figure is considered indicative of the human cost of unsafe migration but is likely to underreport the actual number of people who have died or gone missing during migration. More than 1.9 million migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014. More than 1,000 migrants and refugees have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the UN. A total of 92 migrant deaths were recorded on land in Europe in 2018, and before Wednesday’s discovery of 39 bodies inside a Bulgarian-registered lorry in Essex, 58 deaths had been recorded for 2019, 22 of which were from “vehicle-related” incidents. Five people have drowned in the Channel this year, and a man who stowed away on a plane fell to his death over London on 30 June. A further 24 people have died on the western Balkans route so far this year: eight deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina, six in Serbia, five in Croatia, three in North Macedonia and two in Slovenia. There were 41 deaths in 2018."
2019-12-04T15:46:58Z,Grenade thrown at migrant children's centre in Madrid,"Bomb squad officers in Madrid have carried out a controlled explosion after a practice hand grenade was thrown over the wall of a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors in the north-east of the Spanish capital. A spokeswoman at the Madrid headquarters of the national police force said the grenade carried a small amount of explosive. There were no reported injuries. “Staff at the centre found a suspicious object in the centre’s patio between 8.30 and 9 this morning,” she said. “Specialist officers from the national police force attended and evacuated the children to a safe area. Bomb squad officers detonated the object, which was determined to be a practice grenade with little charge, which had been thrown into the centre’s grounds in a bag from outside.” The reception centre, in the Hortaleza neighbourhood, recently made headlines after it was singled out by Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party. Abascal, who lives in Hortaleza, said the centre and its residents – many of whom are from north and sub-Saharan Africa – had left many local people feeling unsafe. “I live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood – Hortaleza,” he said during an election debate last month. “And every time I’m on the street – and there’s a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors there – I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.” Unaccompanied foreign minors – known by the Spanish acronym menas –were also targeted by Rocío Monasterio, Vox’s leader in Madrid, who called them “a serious problem in our neighbourhoods”. Wednesday’s attack was not the first time that children at the centre have been targeted. In the fortnight before the election, on 10 November, some of them were beaten with oars and clubs. Adriana Lastra, the vice-secretary general of the ruling Socialist party, said that words had consequences. “This is what hate speech brings,” she wrote on Twitter. “It needs to be fought online, on the streets and in our institutions.” Vox also condemned the attack. But in a statement, it accused its opponents of trying to make political capital out of Wednesday’s events. “It’s disgraceful that violence – which is never justified – should be used for political ends,” it said. “We await the conclusions of the investigation by state security forces.”"
2019-10-23T17:08:48Z,Lorry horror highlights risks migrants take to try to reach UK,"The discovery of 39 people dead in the back of a lorry in Essex has renewed focus on the risks taken by undocumented migrants to travel to the UK to seek safety and shelter. A lack of safe and legal routes into the UK is in part driving a dependence on life-threatening methods including squeezing into the back of refrigerated lorries or riding in vulnerable dinghies across wild seas. People fleeing the threat of torture, rape or death cannot claim asylum in the UK without physically reaching Britain, aside from a few limited programmes including the Syrian refugee resettlement programme. Family reunion routes – that is, those granted refugee status in the UK being able to apply to bring relatives to join them – have been drastically curtailed. The UK gave protection – grants of asylum, humanitarian protection or alternative forms of leave and resettlement – to 18,519 people in the year ending June 2019, according to the most recently available figures. However, it is relatively hard to secure asylum in the UK, which hosts less than 1% of the world’s refugees. Furthermore, the hostile environment policy, including the UK’s use of immigration detention (it is one of the only countries in the world where the period of detention is not capped), is likely to have deterred some people from wanting to seek asylum at all for fear they will end up in purgatory. The Dublin regulation, an EU law which states that an individual is eligible to be given asylum only in the first safe country they arrive in, encouraged people with good reasons for wanting to travel to the UK – for example, good command of the language – to attempt to do so by dangerous backdoor routes, often facilitated by ruthless people smugglers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “Nobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy, which has deliberately shut down safe and legal routes to the UK. “We need more than empty expressions of sadness and shock from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson. We need a commitment to opening safe and legal routes to the UK and quick decisions for people seeking to make a better life for themselves in the UK. People move – they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their life to do so.” The National Crime Agency has responsibility for tackling what it calls organised immigration crime. This stands apart from modern slavery and human trafficking because it involves consent on the part of the individual travelling, while the latter involves coerced movement across borders. However, there is an obvious overlap and the incident in Essex could be either of the two. A range of methods are used in organised immigration crime, including clandestine entry from near Europe, air-facilitated migration, use of false or fraudulently obtained documents and abuse of legitimate entry and leave to remain. In 2018 new migrant camps emerged in the Grande-Synthe and Puythouck Lake areas near Dunkirk, where organised crime gangs are known to be active, recruiting migrants for onward movement to the UK. Juxtaposed border controls remain the main targets for clandestine entry into the UK. These controls are part of an arrangement between the UK, France and Belgium whereby immigration checks on certain cross-Channel routes take place before boarding a train or ferry, rather than on arrival. In 2018 the number of Eritreans detected at juxtaposed controls increased notably, with Eritrean nationals found concealed in refrigerated lorries and containers, probably indicating growing levels of organisation. The Guardian understands that last year more than 35,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented at the UK’s juxtaposed controls in northern France and Belgium. During the same 12-month period, more than 8,000 people were detected in the UK, either at ports of entry or having entered the country illegally on a vehicle. The top 10 nationalities of undocumented people found at juxtaposed controls in 2018 were Eritrean, Iraqi, Afghan, Iranian, Albanian, Sudanese, Vietnamese, Pakistani, Syrian and Ethiopian. What could be done in the UK to reduce the chance of individuals attempting such risky journeys? Refugee and asylum seeker rights campaigners have been calling for an extension to refugee family reunion rules to include a wider definition of family, allowing individuals safely based in the UK to bring family members to join them. There have also been calls for the resettlement programme for Syrian refugees, which is run by the UN refugee agency, to be extended to other countries. • This article was amended on 24 October 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Syrian refugee settlement programme as the only one which operates without the person reaching Britain. The Syrian programme is one of a small number of limited refugee resettlement schemes."
2019-12-05T14:37:45Z,Pope's aide takes 33 refugees to Rome after visit to 'shameful' Lesbos camp,"An aide to Pope Francis has urged Catholic churches across Europe to open their doors to refugees after bringing 33 people to Rome from overcrowded, squalid camps on the Greek island of Lesbos. Speaking on his return from a visit to the camps, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Vatican’s almoner, condemned the EU’s handling of the refugee situation, saying that “animals live better in Europe”. The 33 refugees, among them families from Cameroon, Afghanistan and Togo, arrived in Rome on Wednesday night and will be hosted by the Vatican and the Sant’Egidio charity. “We have the money, let’s begin with ourselves … let’s open our rectories, convents and monasteries to at least one family each from the Lesbos refugee camps so that we can empty them all,” Krajewski said after landing at Fiumicino airport, in Rome, with the group from Lesbos. “I have seen terrible situations in the camps.” The population in the island’s camps has increased from 7,000 in May to more than 15,000, of whom 800 are unaccompanied children, Krajewski said. “There is no hope for them stuck in Greece, where they are living in dramatic conditions. This is a problem for Europe and is shameful.” The Vatican’s latest “human corridor” mission from Lesbos was implemented following the approval of Greek authorities and the Italian interior ministry. Pope Francis, who has likened migrant facilities on Lesbos to “concentration camps”, brought back 12 Syrian families after visiting the island in 2016. They were temporarily housed by the Vatican before being helped to integrate into society by Sant’Egidio. Ten more people will be transferred to Italy from Lesbos by the end of the year. Greece has been repeatedly castigated by rights groups and the Council of Europe over the conditions in refugee camps across its islands. On Thursday a fire broke out in a container housing a family of five Afghans in the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos, killing a 27-year-old woman. Other camp residents managed to safely evacuate the children – an infant, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. The children’s mother was found dead after the fire was extinguished. Their father suffered smoke inhalation. A fire broke out at the crowded Moria camp in Lesbos in September killing a woman from Afghanistan and triggering clashes between refugees and police. The facility has been hit by several fires since the EU struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 to stem the flow of migrants, with a woman and child dying in a blaze that year. In November Greece’s centre-right government, which came to power in July, announced plans to close the three largest migrant camps on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos and replace them with facilities on the mainland that campaigners compared to detention centres. The government has vowed to relocate 20,000 asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020. It has also passed a law tightening asylum requirements and pledged to increase border controls. Krajewski was named almoner, a job that Pope Francis transformed into a hands-on charitable mission, in 2013. He has worked discreetly, for the most part, for the poor for years. However, in May this year he made headlines after climbing down a manhole and breaking a seal to restore electricity to a building in Rome where 250 homeless people were living. The move prompted an angry reaction from the far-right politician Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister."
2019-11-19T22:13:52Z,Dozens of migrants found in refrigerated container on ferry,"Dutch authorities have discovered 25 migrants stowed away inside a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for England. According to a statement published on a local government website, all those found onboard were alive, with one of them thought to be a child. The ferry, Britannia Seaways, run by DFDS Seaways, had left the port in Vlaardingen bound for Felixstowe, Suffolk but returned immediately after discovering the people on board. The ship was met by 20 ambulances, and two of the migrants were taken to hospital to be checked for hypothermia. The other 23 received a medical check-up in the port before being processed by police, according to a statement from emergency services. The origins of the migrants are currently unknown, but reports suggest most of them are male. Mirjam Boers, a spokeswoman for Rotterdam police, told the broadcaster RTL that all migrants found on the ship were undergoing checks by emergency responders, but could not comment on the severity of their conditions. “The highest priority is to check how they’re doing medically … This is about human lives and the main thing is that they’re all okay”, she said. She could not confirm whether a child was amongs those found on the ship. Police also told the Dutch broadcaster NOS that the driver of the lorry had been detained and was being questioned about possible human trafficking offences. A DFDS spokesperson said the crew found the people hiding inside a refrigerated container and alerted the police, who arrived on the boat while it was still at sea. The spokesperson said the container was normally locked and sealed, but the stowaways had made a hole in the trailer door. Asked about the security of the containers, the spokesperson told the Guardian security was “very tight” but the incident would be reviewed. “We have surveillance and regular checks of the trailers. It’s a mystery to us. We have good cooperation with authorities at all of our ports, but we have to realise that sometimes migrants do succeed in getting through,” they said. According to the Dutch newspaper AD, police had to search the ferry for more than an hour to find the correct container. The incident follows the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex last month. All of the 39 people who died were Vietnamese nationals, who had travelled inside a refrigerated container from Zeebrugge in Belgium."
2019-08-19T15:50:52Z,Greek NGO helping child refugees wins $2m humanitarian prize,"An NGO helping migrant and refugee children in Greece has won the world’s biggest annual humanitarian award. METAdrasi – Action for Migration and Development received the $2m (£1.6m) Hilton humanitarian prize for its “innovative approach to welcoming refugees and protecting unaccompanied minors”, the Conrad N Hilton Foundation said. Peter Laugharn, the foundation’s president and CEO, told the Guardian: “METAdrasi … demonstrates the power of individuals to make a marked difference in the lives of migrants and refugees in Greece.” Laugharn praised METAdrasi’s pursuit of common-sense solutions, including engaging translators “fluent in over 43 languages and dialects to help navigate extremely complicated policies and procedures”. The frontline organisation was founded in 2009 with the aim of safeguarding the rights of people displaced by war or persecution. From the outset it placed particular emphasis on minors who had reached Greece alone either because they had lost or been separated from parents along the way. The NGO has a permanent presence at all key entry points to Greece and acts as a safety net for unaccompanied children, transporting them from detention centres to suitable accommodation, finding guardians and placing them in foster care or in conditions of supported independent living. It employs 350 interpreters and has helped more than 12,000 minors. METAdrasi’s founder, Lora Pappa, said of the award: “It will enable us to strengthen our advocacy and help us be heard. This is an ongoing crisis. We are so grateful to receive the prize at a time when urgent needs regarding the refugee situation continue to emerge.” The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates there are 80,000 people stranded in Greece, including 4,100 unaccompanied children. The number of arrivals has dropped dramatically since 2016 when the EU struck a deal with Turkey but they are on the rise again. On Lesbos, the eastern Aegean isle once at the centre of the crisis, 9,000 people are detained in a camp meant to house a third of that number. This month, Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, raised the prospect of as many as 35,000 people a day crossing into Europe if Ankara were to turn a blind eye and open the floodgates. “I’m not threatening Europe, I am just pointing something out,” he warned, claiming that the EU had failed to deliver on its promise to give Turkey agreed funds under the 2016 accord."
2019-12-19T11:49:08Z,Boy found alone on M6 motorway after arriving in UK,"A boy believed to be a 15-year-old from Iraq has been found alone on a motorway near Birmingham after allegedly entering the UK illegally. Police officers responding to reports of a pedestrian on the M6 took him into emergency care on Wednesday night and he was subsequently transferred to the care of local social services. West Midlands police contacted the Home Office’s immigration enforcement division shortly after finding him. Using an interpreter, he told of how he had come to the UK, that he was 15 years old, from Iraq, and did not know where his parents were. It is thought he entered the UK recently. “He was split up from his parents a few days ago, and doesn’t know which country they’re in,” the central motorway police group said. “It’s impossible to imagine how scared someone would be, not knowing where they are, not knowing where their parents are, unable to speak the language. “We’ve taken him to a place of safety with food and water until social services can come and take him to care.” West Midlands police said a driver reported seeing the boy walking on the central reservation towards junction 7, the Great Barr interchange – which is about five miles away from West Bromwich – at 10pm on Wednesday. “He was picked up by a police patrol car and taken into emergency care for the night,” a spokesperson said. “It’s understood the male is from Iraq and the matter has been passed to immigration.” Fizza Qureshi, co-chief executive of Migrants’ Rights Network, said she could not imagine how the boy was feeling and called on the government to make it easier for people to seek “refuge and protection” in the UK to prevent deaths of people in transit. “We are extremely concerned to hear of this story,” she said. “We cannot begin to imagine how he is feeling, in unfamiliar surroundings, alone and without his family, not knowing what might happen next. “This boy’s journey of being separated from his parents and family, and being alone, would be similar to those of other unaccompanied minors who have come to the UK because no safe routes exist for people to come to the country for refuge and protection. We must create these routes to prevent any further tragedies.” Liz Clegg, from the Meena Centre in Birmingham, which supports child refugees, told the BBC that reuniting children separated from their parents in such circumstances was a “huge challenge”. She hoped “the system in place would kick in quickly” and that she expected authorities and charities would be working to trace his family. Lucy Leon, from the Children’s Society, said he now faced a drawn-out and legally complex situation, and urged for him to be provided with an independent guardian to represent his interests. “We think it is vital he should also be given an independent legal guardian to represent his best interests, ensure his voice is heard, and that he understands the complex immigration process he is about to embark on,” she said. Only children suspected of being victims of trafficking are given independent legal guardians in England and Wales, but in Scotland and Northern Ireland the “vital support” is given to all unaccompanied refugee and migrant children, she added. “It’s incredibly important he’s got a guardian, someone who’s independent, not part of the local authority, not part of the Home Office, who can really support him through that complex legal process,” she said. “Quite often we see in our work young people slipping through the net and not being identified as a victim of trafficking and exploitation, or even at risk.” Iraq was the second most common country of nationality for people applying for asylum in the UK last year. There were 2,700 applicants, 43% of whom were granted protection, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. The Home Office said the boy’s case would be dealt with according to the immigration rules. In October, 39 Vietnamese nationals, including 10 teenagers, were found dead in a lorry in Essex, leading the foreign affairs select committee to declare that the UK’s policy of closing borders drives migrants into smugglers’ hands."
2019-12-04T06:00:43Z,The 'qualifications passport' scheme breaking down barriers for migrants,"The armed rebels had first ransacked the hospital where Timothée* worked as a doctor. Then, they went door to door with machetes, hunting down those seen as the wealthiest – the most educated first. When the house next door was burned down with his neighbours still inside, Timothée fled. Without a chance to grab his passport or phone, Timothée ran through the darkness of the bush of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, knowing he might never see his family or his fiancee again. When he reached a refugee settlement in Meheba, Zambia, in September, Timothée had no proof of his previous life. But now he has a little more hope about the future. In Zambia, a pilot qualifications passport scheme is being run by the government and the UN agency Unesco to help refugees access jobs or further education in the country by informally verifying their qualifications when they do not have crucial paperwork. A joint Unesco/UNHCR report found that fewer than 15% of migrants in developed countries say their level of education matches their jobs. In developing countries one in eight immigrants say that having their qualifications recognised is their greatest challenge in settling into new lives, more so than language, discrimination or even visa restrictions. Of the 60 who applied from his camp, Timothée was among 11 who reached the required standard. Summarising the holder’s qualifications, experience and language skills, as well as any paperwork available, the qualifications passport is designed to help translate a refugee’s qualifications to those in the host country. The scheme is due to be extended to Iraq and Colombia next year. Timothée feels his years of study and medical practice have at last been recognised. “The day I heard my qualifications had been accepted, I was so happy. I thanked God. It’s a way for me to get my identity back,” he says. Last week, Unesco member states adopted a new convention for “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory recognition” of higher education qualifications. Audrey Azoulay, Unesco’s director general, says it is in everyone’s interests to create a “simple mechanism”. “For governments, there is a clear fiscal argument against the squandering of human capital.” Timothée has managed to let his family know where he is via Facebook on a borrowed phone. He has not yet been able to speak to his fiancee but has established through a friend that she is safe. He hopes he might move to a French-speaking country as it would be easier for him to practise medicine there. France would be nice, but he needs travel documents. He knows there are no guarantees yet, but is hopeful. “Doors are opening for me again”, he says. * Surname withheld on request."
2019-08-25T12:46:19Z,"Nearly 900,000 asylum seekers living in limbo in EU, figures show","Close to 900,000 asylum seekers in the EU are waiting to have their claims processed, according to figures from the European statistics office. Women, men and unaccompanied children are living for years in uncertainty, with numbers of pending applications for international protection almost unchanged from two years ago when 1.1 million migrants were “stuck” in the continent. “Living in limbo is now the norm for those seeking protection,” said Karl Kopp of Pro Asyl, Germany’s largest pro-immigration advocacy organisation. “Limbo means living in the miserable Greek EU hotspots, or being trapped and pushed back at the borders. It means living in the desperate search for protection and human dignity.” Eurostat figures have revealed a backlog of 878,600 requests at the end of 2018, with Germany having the largest share of pending requests (44%), ahead of Italy (12%). The figure comes despite the number of migrant arrivals in Europe practically halving in the last two years. Factors leading to the continuing backlog include new laws from right-leaning governments and an increase in the number of rejections, leading to lengthy appeals processes. “The vision of governments on the migration crisis has changed and more and more countries are rejecting an increasing number of requests for asylum,” said Fulvio Vassallo, an expert on asylum law from the University of Palermo. The rejection rate for asylum requests in Europe has almost doubled in three years, from 37% in 2016 to 64% in 2019. In Italy, rejections were at 80% at the start of 2019, up from 60% the previous year as the populist government also removed key forms of protection. The German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has in 2019 rejected three-quarters of family reunification requests from Greece, where migrants live in the overcrowded camps of Athens and Lesbos. “If a migrant has his asylum request rejected, in any case, he is entitled to have recourse to appeal, which, however, lengthens the time waiting in limbo by up to four years,” said Vassallo. “There are migrants who arrived in 2015 and had their asylum requests denied. At that point they presented an appeal to a court and are still waiting for an answer on their future.” Experts point out how some governments in recent years, especially in Italy and Germany, have accelerated evaluation procedures for asylum requests, which appears to have caused an increase in rejections because high-speed procedures are not carried out with as much thoughtful evaluation. “The agenda of the rightwing extremists is now the agenda of the mainstream and all that matters is high speed, few or no rights in the procedure, highest possible rejection rates and increasing the deportation figures,” said Kopp. “Many rejected asylum seekers receive protection only through a legal action but years of waiting for the court decision extend the limbo situation in an intolerable way.” According to Eurostat, since 2014 there have been 3.6m requests for asylum in EU countries, only 1.8m of which have resulted in legal protection. Those who stay after rejection are at risk of suddenly becoming illegal immigrants. “This is the worrying part of this phenomenon, with thousands of people exposed to the risk of a difficult life, at the mercy of labour exploitation,” said Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, in Italy. According to Eurostat, Germany reported the highest number of illegal migrants in 2018, with 134,100. France was second with 105,900. But Italy, where hardline measures are likely to keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants, could soon far exceed them. Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the Italian thinktank the Institute for International Political Studies, said that based on analysis of figures from the interior ministry, “there could be more than 700,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy by 2020”."
2019-09-04T17:21:55Z,Matteo Salvini replaced by migration specialist in new Italy coalition,"A career civil servant and specialist in migration policy has succeeded the far-right leader Matteo Salvini as Italy’s interior minister in a new left-leaning pro-European coalition government aimed at drawing a line under a crisis sparked by Salvini’s populist League party. Luciana Lamorgese, a veteran of the interior ministry, has in recent years been in charge of planning refugee and migrant reception centres in northern Italy and is known for promoting integration events and policies. She was also the first female security chief, or prefect, of Milan. Her appointment should mark a break from the era of Salvini, whose hardline immigration measures included the closure of Italian ports to NGO rescue vessels and the abolition of key protections for asylum seekers. The coalition assembled by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, between the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) also includes Roberto Gualtieri, an influential PD member of the European parliament, as economy minister. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, will be foreign minister. The new government is expected to be sworn in on Thursday. During the coalition negotiations, the PD repeatedly asked the M5S to abandon the migration policies of the previous government, in which it was in coalition with the League. The key was the abolition of a Salvini-drafted security decree that provided for the seizure of NGO rescue boats and fines for vessels that brought migrants to Italy without permission. Dozens of captains of rescue boats and volunteers subsequently ended up under investigation, with at least eight in the last three months. Prosecutors in Ragusa on Tuesday placed the German captain and the mission chief of the Eleonore rescue ship, operated by the NGO Mission Lifeline, under investigation on suspicion of encouraging illegal immigration. The captain had declared a state of emergency onboard and defied the entry ban, landing more than 100 migrants in Pozzallo, Sicily. Last week Italian officials handed a €300,000 (£270,000) fine to the Mare Jonio, operated by the Italian NGO Mediterranea, which saved more than 100 migrants, including 22 children under the age of 10. Although the number of migrant arrivals in Europe has practically halved in the last two years, hundreds of asylum seekers continue to attempt the crossing from north Africa. Last week, at least two known shipwrecks were registered, according to aid groups, with a total of almost 70 people drowned, while at least two boats have been completely lost. In recent weeks, NGO vessels have saved more than 600 people in total. A French passenger ferry headed to Marseilles from Algiers on Monday rescued 18 people off the Balearic Islands. Campaigners and aid groups hope that, with the new government and above all with the new minister of the interior, Italian policy on the migration crisis can finally change. Graziano Delrio, the PD leader in the lower house, said on Wednesday that a new immigration law has been included in the new government’s political agenda. Carlotta Sami, a spokesperson for the UNHCR in Italy, said: “There is a humanitarian crisis for which everyone must feel responsible: the search and rescue at sea and the common management, at European level, of landings. “There is a chance to carry out inclusion policies towards refugees, policies that consider them a resource and not a problem. There is a lot to do, but we hope Rome will resume the central and crucial role it deserves in these issues.’’ On Tuesday M5S members overwhelmingly backed a coalition with the PD in an online vote, giving the final backing to a deal between traditional foes. “This turning point is good. Now it’s time to change Italy,” said the PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti. “We have stopped Salvini and the mere announcement of this phase is making Italy a protagonist again in Europe.” Salvini, who pulled the plug on Conte’s last government on 8 August seeking snap elections he hoped would boost his party, described the new pro-European coalition as “a government born between Paris and Berlin and from the fear of leaving their posts, without dignity and without ideals, with the wrong people in the wrong place. “They won’t be able to dodge the judgment of the Italians for too long. We’re ready … in the end it is us who will win.” The new ministers will face confidence votes starting on Monday. By this time next week, the new government could already be settled in Rome, with Salvini forced to watch from the opposition benches."
2019-11-18T17:48:10Z,Migrants from Libya not driven by hope of being rescued at sea – study,"No valid statistical link exists between the likelihood that migrants will be rescued at sea and the number of attempted Mediterranean crossings, a study has found. The findings challenge the widespread claim in Europe that NGO search and rescue activity has been a pull factor for migrants. Fear that the NGOs’ missions attract immigrants has been the basis for measures restricting humanitarian ships including requiring them to sign up to codes of conduct or simply blocking them from leaving port. It is the first detailed study of NGOs’ proactive search and rescue activity between 2014 and October 2019, but the findings focus most closely on the first nine months of this year, a period when Europe had withdrawn from all search and rescue activity leaving only NGOs or the Libyan guard. The research was undertaken by two Italian researchers, Eugenio Cusumano and Matteo Villa, from the European University Institute Drawing on official statistics and examining three-day averages, the study showed the numbers rescued depend on the numbers leaving. It found a stronger link this year between the number of migrant crossings and either political stability in Libya or the weather, rather than NGO ships at sea. The study found that in 2015, the total number of departures from Libya slightly decreased relative to 2014 even though migrants rescued by NGOs increased from 0.8 to 13% of the total number of people rescued at sea. After July 2017, the number of migrants departing from Libya plummeted even though NGOs had become far and away the largest provider of search and rescue by far. It also found that in the 85 days in which the NGOs were present in the search and rescue mission there were no more departures than the 225 days in which there were Libyan patrol boats. Instead, the study showed the big decline in crossings in 2017 was linked to the deal struck between the Italian government and various Libyan militia to keep migrants from attempting sea crossings. The study looks at figures from the International Organisation for Migration, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and the Italian coastguard. Over the five years the humanitarian ships have rescued a total of 115,000 migrants out of 650,000 with an average of 18%. In 2019 alone, at least 1,078 migrants have died or gone missing, according to the UN, while trying to reach safety in Europe. While the EU recognises the Libyan coastguard and is also funding and training its work, there is no overall agreement about how asylum seekers should be dealt with in an equitable and EU-wide manner."
2019-09-23T17:04:52Z,EU nations come to Italy's aid over relocating migrants,"Four EU countries have sought to break the deadlock over European migration policy, as Italy’s new government underlined its move away from the hardline policies of former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini. Interior ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Malta have agreed a joint proposal to relocate people rescued at sea and end the plight of migrant rescue boats adrift in the Mediterranean while countries bicker over who should help. The proposals were signed off at a special meeting in the fortified coastal city of Birgu in Malta, shortly after Italy’s new left-leaning coalition government agreed to open one of its ports to a second NGO boat carrying 182 people. The departure of Salvini and his far-right League party from the Italian government has led to the reopening of the country’s ports to NGO search and rescue boats and helped bring about the latest tentative agreement as France and Germany lead efforts to show that Italy will not be left alone in handling migrant arrivals from north Africa. However, the politics of migration continues to divide EU member states, even as the number of people making the dangerous central Mediterranean crossing is sharply down on recent years. In a bid to move on from the rancour of recent years, the latest paper proposes “a temporary emergency mechanism”, which means that rescued migrants would be relocated to other EU member states volunteering shelter, after arriving at a Mediterranean port. “I find it crucial that we move away from ship-by-ship arrangements towards a more predictable solution,” said Maria Ohisalo, the interior minister of Finland, which holds the presidency of the Council of the EU and helped broker Monday’s deal. She said the next step was “bringing together as many member states as possible”. “These arrangements in order to be functional need to be built on shared responsibility involving a sufficiently large number of members states.” The voluntary plan will be presented to the EU’s 24 other interior ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg in October. It is unclear how many will sign up. While the European commission wants all member states to be involved in the scheme, ministers suggested that was unlikely. Hungary has led a band of central European refuseniks that will not take in any asylum seekers under an existing EU relocation scheme. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said the number of refugees redistributed through the scheme would depend on how many countries volunteered to take part. “If we had not now managed to produce a proposal with regard to the sea rescue, Europe’s common asylum policy would no longer have been possible for the foreseeable future,” he said. “We are all of the same opinion that there must be a distribution of refugees, that we must not leave Italy and Malta here alone, and that the amount of refugees to be admitted will be discussed and decided in Luxembourg on 8 October, because the amount depends on the number of member states taking part.” The potential breakthrough came as Italy’s government authorised a second NGO rescue boat carrying 182 migrants to disembark in Sicily. Previously ships carrying migrants had been barred from Italian ports. The Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking, operated by the French charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières, will disembark in Messina on Tuesday at 7am. The ship has picked up at total of 182 migrants from three rubber dinghies in distress. Passengers include several women, very young children and a newborn baby. Passengers jumped for joy after hearing they could disembark at Messina, Associated Press reported. “I’m so full of joy! I don’t know what to say now. I’m so happy! ... No more back to Libya!” Awudu Baluduzzi, 27, from Ghana, told the agency. On 15 September, 82 other migrants have disembarked in Lampedusa, as Italy’s new government intends to draw a line under the crisis. Giuseppe Conte, on his second mandate as prime minister, has promised to revise the previous government’s anti-immigration policies, which provide for the closure of seaports to rescue vessels carrying migrants, the seizure of NGO boats and fines for ships that bring asylum seekers to Italy without permission. He has formed a coalition between the centre-left Democratic Party and anti-establishment Five Star Movement."
2019-09-02T04:00:35Z,Greece sets out emergency plans to tackle surge of migrant arrivals,"The Greek government has announced emergency measures to deal with what it calls “huge waves” of asylum seekers arriving from Turkey amid mounting fears of the 2015 migrant crisis being replayed on the country’s shores. With boatloads of men, women and children once again arriving on Aegean islands, the new centre-right administration vowed to bolster patrols along sea borders that are being targeted with renewed vigour by people-smugglers. “We are seeing huge waves being brought in by traffickers using new methods and better and faster boats,” the country’s civil protection minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, said after the measures were announced at the weekend. “If the situation were to continue we’d have a repeat of 2015. We are going to take measures to protect our borders and we are going to be much stricter, much faster in applying them.” He added that the Greek government would also appeal to Nato and the EU to help step up patrols in the area. The sharp increase in migrant and refugee arrivals appears to have taken officials by surprise. Last week close to 650 people, including 240 children mostly of Afghan origin, landed in a matter of hours on Lesbos, the north Aegean island on the frontline of the refugee crisis four years ago. A crackdown on migrants in Turkey, home to more than 3.6 million displaced Syrians, and renewed fighting in Syria appear to have spurred the jump. In August, Turkish authorities reported a sevenfold increase in those making the crossing into Greece. Nearly half of the 56,000 refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe this year have come through the Greek islands, according to the UN. NGOs describe camps on the islands as stretched to breaking point with men, women and children forced to live in squalid conditions. Almost 11,000 people are currently crammed into Moria, the main refugee settlement on Lesbos, originally designed to host 3,000 at most. After an Afghan teenager was killed during a fight in the camp last week, Unicef raised the alarm and said over 1,100 unaccompanied children were forced to endure “dangerous and overcrowded” conditions in facilities across Greece. Not since March 2016, when the EU struck a controversial deal with Turkey to stem the flows, has Greece witnessed such a surge in numbers. On Friday the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, summoned the Turkish ambassador in protest. On Monday the government, which assumed power barely two months ago, will begin moving refugees to reception centres on the mainland in an effort to decongest island camps. According to Chrysochoidis around 1,500 will be moved, mostly from Samos and Lesbos. Around 100 unaccompanied minors will also be transferred with a view to joining families in other EU member states. “We will also start sending illegal migrants back to Turkey which, after all, is considered a safe country,” Chrysochoidis said. “Of the 80,000 people presently in Greece half should have been sent back already as they do not have the right documents or fulfil the conditions of asylum seekers. Instead only 1,800 have been readmitted to Turkey.” But human rights groups have voiced concerns. With the new government also vowing to abolish appeals to asylum rejections, there are fears of violations as the emergency measures aiming to bring down migrant arrival numbers are enforced. Still, Chrysochoidis claimed that under Syriza, the former leftist government, a particularly “lax approach” had been taken to asylum procedures that needed to be addressed. “In the absence of enough state doctors on islands, private doctors would hand out papers categorising everyone as vulnerable which has contributed greatly to Greece becoming such an attractive destination for smugglers,” he said. Chrysochoidis, brought in by Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to assume a post he first held two decades ago, has attempted to allay fears that authorities were poised to mount a massive crackdown on migrants by saying the government’s aim was to integrate refugees fully. “We don’t want ghetto camps. Asylum seekers will enjoy all their rights under international law in Greece.”"

","Many of us in the Jewish community view with much alarm the government’s apparent proposal to scrap a scheme designed to enable child refugees and asylum seekers to be reunited with family members in the UK (Report, 23 December). This appears to be a move from a bilateral treaty arrangement with the EU to a unilateral statement by a country that will be outside of the EU, which will have the effect of weakening the legal rights of vulnerable children. It is estimated that there are some 1,000 young people facing this situation. At this time of the year, when many are focusing on children, we need to question why the government is using this opportunity to add confusion and uncertainty to the desperate situation which many of these children and young people are facing as they languish in unspeakable conditions. The government needs immediately to strengthen, not weaken, our moral and legal obligations to reunite these young people with their family members in the UK.

2019-12-10T19:12:00Z,Liverpool back calls for investigations into migrant worker deaths in Qatar,"Liverpool have supported calls by human rights groups for thorough investigations into the deaths of migrant workers in Qatar, before the club flies to the Gulf country next week to play in Fifa’s Club World Cup. The Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, has also sought assurances from the Qatar “supreme committee”, which is organising the tournament and the 2022 World Cup, about the progress of investigations into the deaths of two men who had been working on the construction of football stadiums. Moore set out Liverpool’s position in a letter to Nicholas McGeehan and James Lynch, directors of the Fair/Square human rights organisation, who asked him in November to make a public statement of concern about workers’ rights and deaths in Qatar. They highlighted the risks of the intense heat and humidity for people employed on the vast construction projects in the Gulf, citing medical research published in July into deaths of Nepalese workers in Qatar, which concluded that “the increased cardiovascular mortality during hot periods most likely is due to severe heat stress”. McGeehan and Lynch specifically highlighted the death in June of Rupchandra Rumba, 24, a Nepali who died in his lodgings during his period of employment as a scaffolder at the Education City stadium, which was originally designated for Liverpool to play their matches. Rumba’s Qatari death certificate, as is common in the country, attributed his death to a generalised “acute cardio-respiratory failure due to natural causes”, which McGeehan and Lynch described as “not a certifiable cause of death, meaning that Rumpchandra’s death remains unexplained”. McGeehan, formerly Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Lynch, previously a deputy director at Amnesty, have called for full investigations into the deaths in Qatar and the effects of heat. They cited the climate data and conclusions of medical experts, reported by the Guardian in October, that hundreds of migrant workers are dying in Qatar every year due to heat stress. Moore said in his reply that Liverpool had “sought background detail assurances” from the supreme committee about the status of the investigation into Rumba’s death and the progress of compensation for Rumba’s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, and their six-year-old son, Niraj. After Liverpool’s designated venue was moved to the Khalifa International stadium Moore said they had also discussed with the supreme committee the ongoing investigation headed by Sir Robert Akenhead into the death in January 2017 of the British construction worker Zac Cox, who fell from rigging at that stadium. “Like any responsible organisation, we support your assertion that any and all unexplained deaths should be investigated thoroughly and that bereaved families should receive the justice they deserve,” Moore wrote in his reply to McGeehan and Lynch. “Furthermore we also believe that employees should be treated with fairness and respect, which is why we adhere to our own anti-slavery policy and why we are committed to paying the real living wage, among various measures of this kind. These are the standards that we set for ourselves and by which we would hope to be judged given they fall within our own remits and responsibilities. “Nevertheless, we remain a sporting organisation and it is important that we are not drawn into global issues on the basis of where our involvement in various competitions dictates that our fixtures take place. So while we respect and understand the reasons why you have sought a public pronouncement from us, we hope you will respect and understand why we feel such a course of action would not be appropriate. “Having already stated that while we do not visit any country with the objective of bringing about change, but any resultant positive changes would be welcomed, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate that particular message.” McGeehan told the Guardian that he welcomed Liverpool’s intervention: “In their detailed expression of support for investigations into worker deaths and compensation for families, Liverpool have demonstrated more clarity of thought than Fifa and all of their sponsors put together,” he said."
2019-10-13T17:52:30Z,A minefield for both UK and EU migrants | Letters,"Amelia Gentleman’s piece on claiming EU settled status (The long read, 8 October) was helpful and revealing but overlooked the organisation that is probably best placed to steer claimants through the process: Citizens Advice. I am a volunteer adviser and have seen for myself how complicated a business it can be, especially for older people. My conclusion is: don’t try this at home – unless you are very computer-literate. We have far more branches than there are local authorities, and as long as clients have brought all the necessary bits and pieces, they can often get the job done on a single visit. It would benefit a large number of people if you could publicise this. Les Masters Bleadon, Somerset • To add to the debate about the status of EU citizens in the UK, the British government has just seen fit to write individually to all of its citizens resident in Europe and in receipt of UK state pensions, thus entitling us to reciprocal healthcare rights in our country of residence. This missive informs us that our healthcare will only continue to be funded by the UK until the end of next year and that our pensions will only receive index-linked increases until 2023. This is, supposedly, to allow us time to make arrangements. How is this justified? We have all paid our taxes, so why are we suddenly to be deprived of medical services and expected to stretch our meagre pensions even further? Few of us could remotely afford private medical insurance. We hope that our host countries will be considerate enough to continue our medical care – but this will mean they are doing so without any contributions from HMG, which leaves us in a precarious position and subject to the differing priorities of changing governments.

2019-12-12T11:00:05Z,The Bikes of Wrath review – cyclists take the dustbowl migrants' road,"As bike touring booms, we’ve seen a trickle of documentaries by cyclists filming their adventures on helmet cameras. This one, from Australian director Cameron Ford, is slicker than most. In 2015, Ford and four friends cycled 2,600 miles in 30 days across the US in the footsteps of John Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath, following the route of dustbowl migrants searching for a better life. The five men travelled on a budget of $420, the equivalent of the $18 an average depression-era family had to get them to California. This creates the slightly queasy sight of affluent guys in expensive Patagonia T-shirts slumming it and relying on the kindness of strangers – some of whom are themselves clearly only just scraping by on low incomes. Ford and his buddies are a good-natured bunch, endearingly honest and unmacho about their limited cycling experience; one admits he’s never cycled more than 20km. Their plan is to busk for their supper. But, as they pedal through the Bible belt it’s kindness and hospitality all the way: guys in cowboy hats and belt buckles offering a hot meal or a bed or barn for the night to this group of tattooed man-bunned hipsters. In the strongest scenes their hosts read extracts from The Grapes of Wrath, still so contemporary, still burning with injustice; and we see some of the extraordinary photographs of America in poverty by Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans. But the film’s journalistic ambition to examine inequality today – an update of Steinbeck for the 21st century – doesn’t come off. Ford and his mates seem like chill guys; so there’s not much white-hot wrath here. And despite the superior production values, sometimes The Bikes of Wrath feels a bit like watching a home video by someone you’ve never met on their holiday of a lifetime. • The Bikes of Wrath is released in the UK on 13 December."
2019-11-27T11:34:38Z,Search for missing migrants as boat runs into trouble off Morocco,"Four people have died and 16 are missing after a boat carrying 78 migrants got into difficulties while travelling from Morocco to Spain. Spain’s maritime rescue service dispatched a boat, a helicopter and a spotter plane on Tuesday night after receiving news from an NGO that a boat was adrift after setting off from Charrana, Morocco, carrying dozens of people. A spokeswoman for the Salvamento Marítimo said rescuers had saved 62 people from the water 36 miles north-east of the Spanish north African enclave of Melilla at 9.40pm. “Three of them were already dead,” she said. “They were taken to Melilla, where they arrived at 11pm. The death of a fourth person was later confirmed. Fifty-eight people survived and four died.” The spokeswoman could not confirm reports that the boat had overturned. She said a plane and a rescue boat were searching for the missing 16 people and were also on the lookout for another boat that left Morocco on Tuesday afternoon, carrying 73 people. Twenty-one people died in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa last Saturday when a boat carrying 170 migrants capsized a mile off the coast while it was being escorted by coastguards. According to the International Organisation for Migration, 22,970 people have arrived in Spain by sea so far this year, and 325 people have died in the attempt. In 2018, 56,480 migrants and refugees reached Spain by sea, with 769 people dying as they tried to cross. The record number of arrivals to Spain, driven partly by the closure of other European routes, placed huge strain on the country’s reception infrastructure. It was also seized on by conservative and far-right parties who sought to make it a political issue."
2019-01-15T14:25:07Z,EU seeks temporary deal over refugees and migrants rescued at sea,"The European Union is attempting to agree on a temporary deal on the handling of migrants and refugees rescued at sea, after a push for wide-ranging reforms before the European elections failed to win support. Diplomats are studying plans from the European commission for a temporary mechanism to manage rescue boats, after a series of incidents in which vessels were unable to dock in any Mediterranean port. The latest case concerned 49 people who were at sea for almost three weeks onboard two German NGO ships, SeaWatch 3 and Sea Eye. They were allowed to disembark in Malta after a deal was struck to disperse them among eight EU member states. Speaking in the European parliament on Tuesday, the European commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the incident was shameful and called for an end to “unorganised ad-hoc solutions”. A spokeswoman said: “The commission stands ready to work with member states in order to set up temporary arrangements that can ensure solidarity with the most exposed EU countries, which can serve as a bridge until the new Dublin regulation becomes applicable.” The Dublin regulation is a draft EU asylum law that has stalled over proposed quotas to distribute asylum seekers around the bloc. EU legislators – ministers and MEPs – have given up hope of a breakthrough before European elections in May. The latest idea for a temporary fix would not include quotas, nor prejudge decisions on the Dublin regulation, according to one EU source. Elements could include EU funds to return refused asylum claimants to their home countries. The plan has backing from around 10 member states, including France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, but has run into opposition from Hungary, which argues that the policy would encourage more people to attempt the sea crossing. The commission said it was not searching for unanimity but for a “critical mass of countries” to get the plan off the ground. Avramopoulos held separate meetings with Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, and prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, in Rome on Monday to discuss the plans. The commissioner described the meeting as constructive; the Italian government has yet to comment. Since Salvini closed Italian ports to NGO rescue boats last summer, EU countries have been scrambling to come up with ad-hoc arrangements whenever a vessel is stranded. The delays are seen as adding to the distress of those onboard and damaging to the EU’s credibility. “From a political perspective, with every crisis that occurs in the Mediterranean the political leverage of the EU is diminishing rapidly,” said Hanne Beirens, an associate director at the Migration Policy Institute in Brussels. She said the EU’s growing resistance to people coming from Syria had prompted other governments to question whether they should help. “We saw third countries that have been traditionally hosting a lot of refugees, in the Middle East or Kenya, becoming really resistant [and asking]: ‘OK, why should we continue to do this and should we not get more financial help?’” Numbers of people crossing the Mediterranean has fallen sharply since the peak of the crisis, although Spain has seen a surge in arrivals. Beirens said these relatively low numbers could reduce the incentive to reach an agreement, but that a coalition of “the usual suspects” could strike a deal. France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Malta and Ireland have typically been among the countries volunteering to take in refugees. “I expect that de facto there will be some kind of operational agreement because [officials] cannot spend days on the phone each time,” she said. “The question is how long it takes those ad-hoc arrangements to become more long-lasting.”"

2019-10-27T19:52:50Z,Vietnamese migrants face treacherous journey on the way to UK,"In the Vietnamese community it is known as the “VIP” route – an illegal entry into the UK on a flight using someone else’s passport or a doctored diplomatic one. For the majority who do not have the means of affording it however, the clandestine alternative involves crossing the channel in the back of a lorry and facing the risk the journey could end in a tragedy like the one that unfolded last week. That’s according to a source familiar with the recent case of two Vietnamese teenagers who were taken into the care of social services in the UK after travelling from the other side of the world to work in Britain’s nail bar industry. “One of the girls said she went from Vietnam to China and worked there for about a year and a half,” said one member of the community who was familiar with their cases and who added that they were unaware of last week’s tragedy, when 39 bodies were found in a back of a lorry in Grays, Essex. “Then she went from China to Russia, where there was a holding place for people waiting to go further. From the holding place a new journey would start about once a month. Her journey was divided into very different stages, and in every stage she stayed with Vietnamese people.” In most cases, the source added, those who make the trip in a lorry were dropped off not too far from the port of entry, before being left to make their way onwards and into the community in Britain. “We were told by one of the girls that they were dropped off and left on their own and then found their way into a town centre. In most big centres in the UK you’ll have nail shops, usually run by Vietnamese people. They said that they found a shop and went in. “Conditions in the nail bar were very bad, obviously, but it is relative. What is bad here might be very good by Vietnamese standards, and especially if they come from a rural area.” Apparently at least one of the girls wanted to stay in the UK. “She also came from the same province as the people who died in the lorry. The economic situation in that province is very bad.” It’s not clear how the teenagers got on the radar of the police or the social services, who are now caring for them, but it’s clear they are not the only ones. Figures released by the Home Office under the Freedom of Information Act disclose the cases of 121 Vietnamese nationals who were identified as possible victims of human trafficking last year. Adults receive 14 days of what the Home Office calls “move-on” support including accommodation and subsistence, specialist assistance including counselling and access to physical and mental health care. The numbers, released in February this year, are from a live database which is subject to change. Accurate statistics about the real numbers of trafficked Vietnamese people remain elusive, largely because most are hidden and undocumented. According to the Salvation Army, which works with victims of trafficking, more Vietnamese men were referred to the charity between July 2018 and July 2019 than any other nationality. The charity worked with 209 people from Vietnam over that period, a 248% increase on the number referred five years earlier."
2019-09-17T17:33:12Z,Phillip Lee and HIV tests for migrants | Letter,"Dr Phillip Lee MP claims that he has been misrepresented on his 2014 amendment to the immigration bill, saying that he wanted migrants screened for HIV “so that they could be treated”, rather than so they could be kept out (Report, 17 September). The text of his 2014 amendment reads: “(1) The Secretary of State may by order provide that persons who apply for immigration permission must demonstrate that they are not carriers of any of the prescribed pathogens listed in subsection (2). “(2) The prescribed pathogens are— (a) Hepatitis B; (b) HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus); (c) such other pathogens as the Secretary of State may prescribe by order under this section.” It does not mention anything about treatment. It seems that if anyone has misrepresented Dr Lee’s views, he himself has, either in 2019 or in the text of his 2014 amendment.

2019-12-29T07:04:31Z,Foster agencies add pressure on UK to take child refugees,"Pressure is building on the Home Office to fulfil its promise to give sanctuary to child refugees as it emerged that foster agencies across the UK have offered dozens of places that remain unused. Estimates suggest there are hundreds of places available for vulnerable unaccompanied minors in addition to the 1,400 offers from local councils that the Home Office is accused of ignoring. Britain’s largest fostering and adoption charity, Tact Care, said that fostering agencies had told the Home Office they had significant capacity to house child refugees. Tact Care alone had 25 spaces that could be used immediately. Andy Elvin, chief executive of Tact Care, said: “The Home Office could easily accommodate its obligations to offer sanctuary to vulnerable minors. Its response has nothing to do with capacity, it’s essentially an ideological decision they are making. It’s not one based on child welfare or our ability to do it as a country, it’s that they don’t want to do it. We’ve told the Home Office but they are not interested.” Pressure is also mounting on cabinet ministers who backed a scheme to welcome unaccompanied minors to take a “moral stance” after some protections for children were dropped from the Brexit bill. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, was one of the Tories to rebel in support of a plan drawn up by the Labour peer Lord Dubs in 2016, which committed the UK to accept almost 500 unaccompanied child refugees. Lord Dubs was one of 10,000 children rescued from the Nazis by the Kindertransport in 1939. A separate commitment to allow child refugees stranded in Europe to reunite with families in Britain after Brexit was dropped by Boris Johnson. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, called on ministers and Tory MPs to reverse the “moral disgrace” of removing the protection for children. “At the election, Johnson promised to maintain the UK’s reputation as a ‘beacon of freedom and human rights’.” he said. “However, at the first hurdle, he showed his true colours: tearing up protection for some of the world’s most vulnerable people.” Charities are stepping in after growing frustrated with the Home Office’s slowness in transferring child refugees to the UK. The Dubs amendment of May 2016 followed a public outcry about the plight of children stranded in Europe. Campaigners had hoped that as many as 3,000 children would benefit, but ministers set a limit of 480. The Home Office refuses to specify how many of these children have since been transferred to Britain. Now a project, funded by a Jewish philanthropist, will find family-based placements for children who arrive under the Dubs scheme and ensure that councils have money upfront to provide a home. The project, launched in Bristol, Wiltshire and the London borough of Lewisham, and run by a Christian charity called Home for Good, is seeking an initial 20 homes. The charity said the situation was so poor that it had identified children processed by the UN refugee agency in European camps who were still waiting for places to become available. Emily Christou, head of advocacy at Home for Good, said: “We heard that the 480 still seems to be way off. We knew there was public goodwill out there and we knew that local authorities are saying they’ll take more.” The scheme’s first meeting between a family and a social worker took place last week. The next step will be winning approval from a local authority panel and receiving an allowance to cover the costs of opening their home. Jennifer Nadel, co-director of the campaign group Compassion in Politics, said: “It is scandalous and heartbreaking that the UK isn’t honouring its moral and legal obligation to these refugee children. We are the fifth largest economy in the world; we have families and local authorities willing to welcome these children with open arms. The problem is the lack of political will.” The Home Office says it is committed to the Dubs scheme and that safeguarding vulnerable children will remain a priority after Brexit."

The children we support have family in the UK and the right to family reunion under EU law. They should be safe with their loved ones, not stuck in overcrowded camps in intolerable conditions, waiting for months, even years, to be transferred to safety. But at a time when safe, legal routes are needed more than ever, a no-deal Brexit could block the route to family reunion for these children. The UK must not abandon unaccompanied children in Europe.

2019-10-25T20:13:54Z,Amnesty leaders condemn US's Remain in Mexico policy as 'disgrace',"Amnesty International leaders from around the world on Friday decried the US policy of sending asylum-seekers back to dangerous Mexican border towns to wait for their immigration cases as an “international disgrace” that must be ended. During a visit to the US-Mexico border this week, Amnesty International leaders from the US, UK, Kenya, Mexico, Greece and Canada said the Remain in Mexico, or Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), program had manufactured a crisis at the border by sending more than 50,000 people to Mexico. The asylum seekers, mostly families from Central America, are waiting in some of the most dangerous cities in the world, where they must fend for themselves without healthcare, work opportunities or school for their children. “The Remain in Mexico policy is nothing short of an international disgrace, rather than calling it a migration protection policy this is really a migrant rejection policy,” said Irungu Houghton, the executive director of Amnesty International Kenya. “It is incompetent, it is inhumane, and it is a cruel way of dealing with people who are fleeing for their lives. “Rather than funding programs that deal with the reasons why people are coming into the United States of America or even dealing with the consequences of dealing with these large numbers of people, precious resources are being spent militarizing borders and building walls,” he added. Houghton noted that Kenya is currently hosting 468,000 refugees, while the US, a much bigger country, has drastically shrunk its refugee and asylum programs. Gabriel Sakellaridis, executive director of Amnesty International Greece, said he was shocked by the scenes at the border and the US had engineered a situation similar to Europe, which has been pushing asylum and refugee processing outside its borders. “In both of these ways, we see the United States and Europe, who are two of the wealthiest and most prosperous areas in the world, trying to create a front yard in either Mexico, or in Turkey or in Libya, in order to avoid their obligations to international refugee law and human rights,” Sakellaridis said. The Remain in Mexico policy started in Tijuana in January before being rolled out at other border cities. Trump administration officials have said it is effective at keeping people out of the US and is improving due process – the opposite of what advocates on the border have reported. This month, Human Rights First revealed at least 340 reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacks against people returned to Mexico while they wait for their case to be heard in US immigration court Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said people they visited in camps in Matamoros, where more than 2,000 people are staying in squalid conditions, expect to be kidnapped and many had been kidnapped more than once. “This expectation is part of the daily life waiting for their asylum cases to be considered,” Huang said. “It’s something that they all know will happen and it adds incredible stress to the already existing trauma these people have experienced.” Kate Allen, executive director of Amnesty International UK, said “people’s lives are absolutely being ruined” by the Remain in Mexico policy. “This chaos of 50,000 people is completely self-inflected and unnecessary,” Allen said. Like the other leaders, she commended the work of shelter operators in Mexico, legal aid providers, teachers and other volunteers trying to help refugees at the border. Allen said: “In all this what is quite wonderful is to see the way that civil society on both sides of the border is doing absolutely everything it can do, so ordinary people, who are taking action.”"
2019-11-07T19:32:23Z,Indigenous Mexicans tortured in migrant crackdown win public apology,"Four indigenous Mexicans who were illegally detained and abused by immigration agents during a US-backed crackdown have received a rare public apology by the Mexican government for the ordeal. The group were on a bus of seasonal farmhands in central Mexico when apprehended in 2015 by immigration agents who targeted them because of their physical features, clothes and limited Spanish. The agents accused the four of being undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, but they were indigenous Tzeltal Mayans from the poor state of Chiapas in southern Mexico, where 25% of the population speak an indigenous language. Shortly after the ordeal, the Guardian revealed that three of the four – siblings aged 15 to 24 – were taken to a detention centre in Querétaro in central Mexico and held for eight days. One of them, then aged 18, was beaten and given electric shocks until he agreed to sign a deportation document admitting they were Guatemalan, even though he cannot read or write. The siblings narrowly avoided being expelled from their home country after the fourth – the older sister’s boyfriend – alerted a human rights organization. On Thursday, Mexico’s current immigration (INM) chief admitted they were subjected to human rights violations as a result of racial profiling. “On behalf of the National Migration Institute, I offer this public apology, for the transgression of their human rights, for the damage to their image, honor and dignity caused by the actions of the migration agents,” said Francisco Garduño Yáñez. Six immigration officials, who have not been named, were suspended for two to four weeks for their role in the abuse, Garduño said. The apology does not mention torture, even though the Human Rights Commission in Mexico City concluded that Alberto suffered post-traumatic psychological symptoms as a result of being tortured. “I really thought I was going to die, so I signed lots of sheets of paper – but I can’t read or write so I didn’t know what I was signing,” Alberto told the Guardian through a translator in 2016. At the time, the INM denied the incident ever happened. As part of its package of reparation measures, the INM has also pledged to stamp out racial profiling by training agents in cultural sensitivity and human rights: “The institute is committed to ensuring that human rights violations like these do not happen again,” Garduño said. The youngest victim, now 19, welcomed the news. “Good. That means my younger brothers and sisters will be able to travel to Sonora to work,” she told the Guardian through her lawyer. The supreme court will soon rule on the constitutionality of the current migration law, which permits agents to employ racial profiling on Mexican citizens who may not know the law, speak Spanish – or who are simply afraid of authorities, said Gretchen Kuhner, the director of Institute for Women in Migration (Imumi), one of the organizations representing the victims. Kuhner said: “The case demonstrates a larger pattern of abuse by INM agents who use racial profiling to harass indigenous and other Mexicans. In the current crackdown, Mexicans are even more vulnerable to these types of abuses by immigration agents and the new national guard.” In recent months, thousands of troops have been deployed to help the INM detain migrants as part of a controversial deal in which President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to stop more migrants reaching the US border to avoid punishing US trade tariffs."
2019-11-09T23:36:18Z,Hunt for migrants after boat spotted at Kent coast village,"Police were trying to track down a group of migrants late on Saturday night, who were seen arriving by boat on the Kent coast, renewing concerns about border security. They were spotted at the village of Seabrook, near Hythe, at 6am on Saturday, prompting a search operation involving police, Border Force officials and a Coastguard helicopter. The operation came as police in Essex started repatriating the bodies of the 39 people who died in the back of a refrigerated lorry last month. On Friday police released the names of the Vietnamese victims. Ten teenagers were among those found in the container, shipped from Belgium to Essex on 23 October. Anti-Slavery International said it was concerned about the numbers of young Vietnamese nationals being arrested by UK police, despite concerns that they may have been trafficked. Data from freedom of information requests sent by the charity to British police forces showed that 6,796 Vietnamese nationals were arrested between 2012 and 2018, including 1,127 children. Where the reason for arrest was recorded, more than 40% concerned an immigration offence and almost a third were in relation to drugs. “A major concern highlighted by the data is the high number of children being criminalised, many for immigration offences,” said an Anti-Slavery International spokesman. “This raises concerns as this research has identified that most children do not organise their own travel and are controlled by adults. Having irregular status is a significant indicator that they may be victims of trafficking.” Maurice Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland, who was driving the lorry in which the victims were found, was charged last month with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people. At least 10 others have been arrested in Vietnam as the police investigation narrows on the origin of the smuggling network. Vietnamese smugglers have named the deadly route taken by those seeking to reach Britain as the “CO2” route: a poorly ventilated journey across the English Channel in containers or trailers, the last stage of their hazardous voyage from Asia. On Saturday, as the weather worsened, attention remained on the Kent coast following the early-morning report of Channel crossings. It follows two incidents on Friday where the Border Force intercepted 20 people in the Channel. The men from both boats were taken to Dover, the Home Office said, where they were expected to be medically assessed before being interviewed by immigration officials. On Wednesday Dutch police found 16 migrants, including four children, in a lorry that was about to board a ferry at a Dutch port heading for Britain. The occupants, reportedly of various nationalities, were found after the driver told border guards at the port of IJmuiden that he had heard sounds in the trailer of the lorry. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has said Britain should continue to attend EU meetings on migration."
2019-11-07T08:14:19Z,French police begin clearing makeshift migrant camp in Paris,"Hundreds of French police have begun clearing more than 1,000 migrants and refugees from a makeshift camp in northern Paris, where they had been sleeping rough in squalid conditions for months. Police arrived at the site near Porte de La Chapelle before 6am local time (0500 GMT) on Thursday, after the country’s centrist government set out Emmanuel Macron’s tougher stance on immigration this week and vowed to clear the camps. Within an hour the first buses had departed to take people temporarily to gyms and requisitioned buildings in the Paris region while immigration authorities check their status. Women and children were first in the queues, while men waited calmly to leave, some clutching bags of few belongings. More than 3,000 people had been sleeping on pavements and under bridges and canals in northern Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, with scant access to running water and no showers. Many had complained of rats, and charities had warned of appalling sanitary conditions. Some of those queuing for buses had refugee status but had not been able to find permanent accommodation. One such man from Sudan told France Info radio: “It is awful. I sleep outside, sometimes I eat, sometimes I don’t.” He said he expected to be taken to a makeshift shelter in a gymnasium. “But I really need a proper home, to get some training, to work. I want to live.” The problem of makeshift camps for migrants and asylum seekers forming on the streets of northern Paris is not new. There have been more than 30 clearances in the capital over the last four years, but each time hundreds more people end up back on the streets shortly after. Local politicians have said the problem is that the state does not offer proper accommodation and facilities for asylum seekers who are being processed. The Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has regularly accused Macron’s government of failing to provide help for the large number of people sleeping rough in the city. She said she had been given assurances from state authorities that those being evicted on Thursday would be found permanent accommodation. Hidalgo, observing the police clearance, said: “At last today a message is being sent that we have to have organised, dignified, humanitarian solutions.” She said it also sent a message to residents of the area that “you have not been abandoned”. In a sign of the state’s determination to stop people returning to sleep rough in the same part of the city, Michel Cadot, the head of Paris’s police force, said there would be a permanent police presence there “to stop these camps reforming. That is the new element compared to all the measures taken in the past,” he said. He described the evacuation of the camps as allowing the state to “take back the public space”. Police authorities described it as a “humanitarian” operation to take people to shelter. Other camps in northern Paris will be evacuated in the coming days."
2019-12-31T07:00:29Z,"'Looking back, I realise I was naive': reporting on the refugee crisis","There was a tangible sense in 2016 that, if only the world knew what was happening, we would rise to tackle the challenge of the refugee crisis. I never thought that three years on little would have changed. In fact, the situation in Greece seems more bleak than ever. Looking back, I realise I was naive. We have not only failed, we have broken promises. Britain pledged to take 3,000 unaccompanied minors. We have taken just over 200. The conditions in the camps are squalid and chaotic. Interviewing people in their temporary homes, I started to imagine sharing a tiny tent, a space not big enough to stand up in, with my five family members. Even the thought is unfathomable. The first person I interviewed was a 24-year-old Afghan woman who had lost her sister on the journey from Afghanistan to Greece. As I watched tears stream down her face, I had to hold back my own. I hate asking the same reductive questions to each person I meet - “Where are you from?” “Why did you leave?” - knowing that what they say will never do justice to the pain and hardship of their journey. What I really wanted to ask everyone I met was “How do you survive here?”, but the words wouldn’t leave my lips for fear I would alienate them. Masouma Ibrahimi, 42, Afghanistan with Ali Aghbar, seven, and Ali Akbar, two. I weaved through muddy tracks in the tiny spaces between cramped tents, with a crisscross of cables above providing enough energy for a small light in each tent. Everywhere I looked, kids played in filth. I counted just two sets of portable cabin toilets for almost 13,000 people. Next to them, a pile of rubbish as tall as me. I was heartbroken to hear from countless women that they were unable go to the toilet alone at night for fear of being raped. Fatima Hosseini, 25 I met a 25-year-old Afghan woman called Fatima Hosseini. I will never forget her words. Practically speechless, I said softly: “I’m so sorry.” She replied: “Everyone comes here and says sorry. I hate this word.” I took her portrait, knowing I may not be able to give her anything in return. Mohammad Rezwani and his family It’s hard not to be acutely aware that at the end of the day, I was able to leave the horrors of the camp behind. I never quite shake off the discomfort of such an unjust imbalance of power. Moria is an old military base designed to house 3,000 people, but it’s home to more than 14,000. Makeshift hairdressers and market stalls were a few reminders of civilisation in the chaos of everyday life in the camp. Many Greek people have been unsung heroes on the frontline of the crisis, but the national mood has grown increasingly hostile to refugees. The volunteers I met, many of them Greek, were exhausted. The strain on those living on the islands is evident. On some of the islands the number of migrants is now equal or close to the number of residents. Tensions will only grow as these conditions are allowed to worsen. Locking people up indefinitely is not a solution. We must see a serious commitment from the Greek government to put a place in plan to provide asylum and routes to resettlement. However, Greece must not be left alone to provide an adequate immigration policy. This is a collective European problem that needs a collective European response. Refugees arriving on Greek shores have fled violence and untold horrors. They do not deserve to be met with detention, hostility and further suffering. Yassin Raqyar, 27, and Massouma The photo of Alan Kurdi symbolised the power of photography to capture the world’s attention, even for a brief moment. The three-year-old’s tragic death inspired the establishment of the remarkable grassroots organisation Help Refugees, and was ultimately a catalyst for the work I do now. I wish I could say his death had been a wakeup call for us all, but since 2015 we have turned a blind eye as the Mediterranean has become the most dangerous border in the world. I have felt increasingly disillusioned, but I hope I never lose faith in the power of the image. Hope also comes from the actions of the grassroots groups on the Greek islands providing the most basic services where governments are failing. The brave heroes who have crowdfunded for rescue boats and now patrol the seas saving lives every week. The volunteers who have been the sole provider of toilets, showers and taps in and around the Moria camp for the last few years. The teachers, doctors and dentists who leave their homes across Europe and volunteer in their holidays to help others. Hope comes from those around the world who still care. It is only by recognising our shared humanity that we accept our moral responsibility to those knocking at Europe’s door. It is ultimately a test of our character. Help Refugees supports over 100 projects across Europe, the Middle East and on the US-Mexico border, working with local partners and over 30,000 volunteers to provide aid and long-term solutions to improve the lives of refugees."
2019-09-30T05:30:58Z,Pride and prejudice: the best books on the refugee experience,"The refugee story doesn’t end at asylum and safety, the moment when many readers look away. It is an endless battle with pride, shame, identity and especially language. I can’t imagine a worse way to begin it than as a teenage girl. No memoir captures my own post-asylum years like Eva Hoffman’s 1989 account of adolescence as a clever but foreign girl (a child of Holocaust survivors relocating to Canada) with no money and a heap of desires. Lost in Translation was published the year I arrived in the US from Iran (via Dubai and Italy), in a way similar to Hoffman: a child with no choice, old enough to struggle with English, habits, shame. I could have used the book then. I didn’t discover it until I was at college, but its truth stung me again and again until I was numb, and delirious with the joy of being understood – not by just any immigrant girl, but by a Harvard graduate, and a former editor of the New York Times Book Review. Every refugee has escaped from something, often unthinkable. Among ourselves, exiles know the best way to tell stories is with comedy. Mazen Maarouf’s Jokes for the Gunmen is a hilarious and bizarre portrait of childhood in wartime. These tales show the strangeness of the world through young eyes, and given their indistinct sense of place, they evoke many childhoods and many funny families (including mine). Maarouf’s power comes from knowing that humans will persist in their absurdity even to the point of death. For a rigorous journalistic understanding of today’s primary migrant route into Europe (through the western Balkans), I recommend BBC correspondent Nick Thorpe’s The Road Before Me Weeps. It is an intimate, heartbreaking account of daily life in transit, in this particular social and political context, and of the many ways these families are rejected and exploited along the way. I was blown away by how much this man saw – things that have taken me 30 years of reflection to be willing to talk about. One of the most infuriating distinctions made in today’s refugee debate is between refugees and economic migrants, who are often young men depicted as opportunists. In his novel Nowhere Man, Aleksandar Hemon dares to give the unpalatable immigrant boy a place. Here is Jozef, who arrived in Chicago before the siege of Sarajevo and must now watch his home turn to ruins, without even the designation of refugee as shelter. “I am complicated,” he says, as he struggles with a new identity thrust upon him by fate. The displacement narrative must naturally end with the gaze falling back on to home, and with the futility of return, the condition of permanent psychic exile. Anton Gill’s The Journey Back from Hell is a powerful collection of oral testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust, a symphony of old trauma and grief, and a complex depiction of the impossibility of going back. Literature is a means of calling out to others to share our truest stories. Lately, I have my eyes on No Friend But the Mountains, Behrouz Boochani’s memoir of his flight and incarceration on Manus Island, which he wrote on a phone and smuggled out of the prison. Boochani is still confined, his past out of reach, his future unknowable. I send him solidarity from this side of our intersecting saga. And a warning from Rilke: “Beware o wanderer, the road is walking too.” • The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (£16.99).

2019-10-31T13:49:16Z,Italy to renew anti-migration deal with Libya,"Italy is to renew its deal with the UN-backed government in Libya under which the Libyan coastguard stops migrant boats at sea and sends their passengers back to the north African country, where aid agencies say they face torture and abuse. The foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, told the lower house of parliament it would be “unwise for Italy to break off its agreement with Libya on handling asylum seekers and combating human trafficking”. The deal was agreed in February 2017 in an attempt to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Sicily’s shores. Italy agreed to train, equip and finance the Libyan coastguard, including providing four patrol vessels. The deal, due to expire on Saturday, will be renewed automatically unless one of the parties opts out. Di Maio said: “The document can be amended but it is undeniable that it has reduced the number of arrivals and deaths at sea.” Sources close to the Italian government said amendments should include evacuation programmes to resettle asylum seekers and measures to ensure the presence of humanitarian organisations in Libyan detention centres. It is not clear whether Tripoli would agree to such changes. Médecins Sans Frontières said the proposed changes would serve only to “perpetuate policies of rejection and detention” in Libya. “The only possible solution is to completely overcome the arbitrary detention system and end the support offered to the Libyan authorities that feed suffering, violations of international law and the odious work of smugglers,” said Marco Bertotto, MSF’s head of advocacy. Early in October the Italian newspaper Avvenire revealed that a man described as one of the world’s most notorious human traffickers attended a series of meetings in Italy in May 2017 between Italian officials and a Libyan delegation to discuss controls on migration flows from north Africa. The alleged trafficker, Abd al-Rahman Milad, nicknamed Bija, is a captain of the Libyan coastguard."
2019-09-05T17:36:45Z,UK must stay part of refugee family reunion route | Letters,"I am alarmed by the suggestion that the UK would drop out of the system that allows asylum-seeking children to reunite with family members in the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit (Refugee children ‘at risk’ from no deal, 2 September). While the impact this would have on unaccompanied children is particularly distressing, it would also affect many other refugees including husbands and wives, brothers and sisters. Over 1,000 people were reunited with family members in this country through the Dublin system last year. It is vital that the government sets up contingency measures so that families do not risk being stranded in separate countries after 31 October. If this route will no longer be open, it’s more urgent than ever that ministers make our domestic family reunion rules fairer. Allowing refugees to reunite with their loved ones provides a lifeline from dangerous and degrading conditions, and makes it easier for refugees to integrate and lead dignified lives again. Danny Sriskandarajah Chief executive, Oxfam GB • The plight of children separated from their parents is one of the many terrible aspects of the migration policy crisis and the Dublin regulation is one effective way of dealing with this problem. In recent months at Arhag, a BAME housing association in London working with migrants and refugees, we have dealt with four such cases helping to reunite children with parents in the UK. Few would oppose schemes that bring torn-apart families back together . The consequence of ending the route provided by the Dublin system will mean more perilous crossings and more tragedies for families who are trying to be reunited. We and our partners at The People’s Place join the UNHCR in urging the government to keep the arrangements in place.

2019-11-17T06:00:09Z,Government ‘exploits migrants for profit’ by outsourcing visa services to private firms,"The government has been accused of exploiting migrants for profit and leaving them in legal limbo after its visa application services were outsourced to private firms. The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA) says that those seeking to work or settle in the UK are being pressed into paying premium rates for a fast-track service that does not reliably deliver. Visa services for overseas applicants were outsourced to a Dubai-based firm, VFS, in 2014 and the process for those applying for residency permits was handed over to a French company, Spora Steria, last year. Home Office revenues from overseas visa applications have soared ninefold to £1.6bn after VFS took over and much of the income is from heavily promoted add-on services such as fast-tracking and document checking. Applicants are warned that they must wait six months for a decision unless they pay an additional premium of up to £800 for a 24-hour “super priority” service. “We are concerned that these services may exploit vulnerable and less well-informed migrants, who may feel pressured to purchase an expensive service which will not provide them with any benefit,” said ILPA chief executive Nicole Francis. “The contract between UKVI and the subcontractors may have resulted in UK Visa and Immigration [UKVI] benefiting financially from the selling of additional services to customers.” A shortage of free appointments for those already in the UK has forced some to pay the fee to renew their residency permit before their visas expire. However, the prominent promotions of priority services on the government website do not specify that the 24-hour timescale applies only to the decision about a visa application, not to how long it will take to receive a biometric residency permit (BRP). These hold a person’s fingerprints and photograph on a secure chip, and can be used to confirm information on work and benefits entitlements. The delays by the Home Office and its subcontractors are leaving some applicants unable to work or leave the country for weeks after they have paid the premium. Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo, a university research fellow from Mexico, paid £2,350 to extend his work visa, including £500 for the priority service to avoid the six-month wait. Over two months later he was still awaiting his residency permit after it was delivered to the wrong address by DX, the courier contracted by the UKVI. He was told that he could not contact the Home Office directly, and that since its subcontracted helpline has no access to application details his only option was to apply again. He was obliged to pay another £1,135 in priority fees as no free appointments were available and DX was unable to locate his office block. “Royal Mail, Amazon, even Asda manage to deliver to my building, which happens to be a conspicuous national research facility – and they charge £4.50 or so for a delivery,” he says. “The Home Office cannot manage the same feat for £3,485.20.” His request for his priority fees to be refunded was refused. UKVI instead advised him to change his delivery address, which he is unable to do because DX can’t provide a tracking number for the order. “No one should be treated and squeezed for money like this, regardless of where they are born,” he says. “My experience shows how little the Home Office cares about the applications it receives for work visas, the fantastically large sums of money involved in the process and the lack of channels to appeal against flagrant negligence.” His BRP eventually arrived via Royal Mail after the Observer intervened. The Home Office told the Observer that he was not due a refund of his priority fees since both applications had been processed on time and the delays were due to delivery errors. A DX spokesperson said: “We are obviously very disappointed that Mr Lozada-Hidalgo had a poor experience with our delivery service and we wish to apologise to him. We have looked into the matter and have identified steps to improve our service in the light of his experience.”"
2019-10-04T18:37:06Z,Greek PM: EU states must do more to share burden of hosting refugees,"The Greek prime minister has called for sanctions to be imposed on EU member states that refuse to share the burden of hosting refugees, as the country struggles to handle burgeoning numbers of asylum seekers. Amid mounting tensions over the dramatic increase in men, women and children crossing from Turkey, Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned that his centre-right government would take a tougher line than its leftist predecessor, stepping up deportations and internationalising the issue. “I will say this clearly: I will raise the matter of specific sanctions for European countries that refuse to take part in a fair distribution of refugees on a European level,” he said on Friday, as senior EU officials visited Athens and Ankara for talks on the migration crisis. The influx has overwhelmed Aegean island camps and put the new government on the defensive, barely three months after it was voted into office. This week riots erupted in Moria, the vastly overcrowded registration centre on Lesbos, after an Afghan woman died in a fire at the facility, prompting demands for mass transferrals to the Greek mainland. The camp is now operating at four times over capacity with 13,500 living mostly in flimsy tents. In other islands across the Aegean archipelago, close to 30,000 are currently forced to endure conditions human rights groups have described as deplorable. Mitsotakis pledged to move as many as 20,000 to the mainland, insisting “we don’t want fences or walls”, but he also claimed that most of those now entering Greece were economic migrants rather than refugees. “Today only two out of 10 are Syrians,” he told parliament, recalling that in 2015, at the height of Europe’s migration crisis, 75% of those landing on Greek shores had come from the war-torn nation. “Some 50% are Afghans and Pakistanis, who are moved by organised traffickers. Most have the profile of economic migrants, not refugees.” The sharp increase has alarmed Brussels and Berlin. Under a landmark accord struck with the EU in March 2016, Ankara agreed to curb flows by enhancing patrols along its Aegean coast. In return, Brussels promised to hand over $6bn in funds to the country. Amid bitter recriminations over the amount of money given thus far, Turkey’s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has threatened “to open the gates” and flood Europe with migrants if demands aren’t met. The Turkish leader is also pressing for European support in creating a “safe zone” in northern Syria where Ankara aims to resettle some 2 million Syrian refugees. As home to close to 4 million displaced Syrians, Turkey hosts more Syrians than any other place in the world. With concerns heightened over the pact’s durability, the European commission’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, and German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, held talks in Turkey and Greece on Friday as officials called for more deportations of asylum seekers whose applications are rejected. Mitsotakis reiterated his government’s plans to send back 10,000 migrants to Turkey by the end of 2020 – an eight-fold increase of the number readmitted under the former Syriza administration. But the returns – and plans to create closed, pre-deportation centres – are controversial. “We are very much opposed to this policy of deterrence,” Dimitris Vitsas, the former migration minister under the Syriza government, told the Guardian. “In every flow there is a mix of migrants and refugees. To say that only migrants are arriving now is very wrong when you are asking for others to equitably share the burden. Does this government honestly think that Hungary and other [central and European countries] will accept to take in more when it is openly saying they are not refugees?”"
2019-11-17T23:25:41Z,39  migrants detained after four boats stopped near Dover,"A total of 39 people have been detained after four small boats were intercepted attempting to cross the English Channel. The boats were discovered near Dover early on Sunday morning, with officials first being alerted to a vessel carrying nine people at 4.30am. Border Force officials made a second interception at 6am, when a vessel carrying five people was found. Between 7am and 7.30am a further two boats were intercepted, with 11 people on the first and 14 on the second. All 39 presented themselves as Iranian nationals, a government spokesperson said. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “Border Force dealt with four incidents on November 17 after being alerted to small boats travelling across the Channel towards the UK. The people from all boats were taken to Dover, where they were medically assessed before being interviewed by immigration officials. “Crossing the Channel in a small boat is incredibly dangerous. Anyone attempting the journey is taking a huge risk with their life and the lives of their loved ones.” In September, a record 86 migrants crossed the English Channel in a single day."
2019-06-26T13:42:51Z,Far-right suspect confesses to killing German politician,"A far-right extremist has confessed to murdering a pro-refugee German politician who was found dead outside his house on 2 June having been shot in the head. Stephan Ernst, a 45-year-old German man with a string of convictions for violent anti-migrant crime, was arrested two weeks after the murder of Walter Lübcke, 65. Police had matched Ernst’s DNA with evidence recovered from the scene of the crime. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said on Wednesday that Ernst had confessed to what Seehofer called a “political murder” and that the hunt was still on for possible accomplices. Ernst reportedly said Lübcke’s pro-refugee stance was his motive. Lübcke, a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), was well known as a champion of refugees in Germany. He had previously received death threats due to his stance. Ernst admitted being incensed by Lübcke’s comments at a town hall meeting in October 2015, Spiegel Online reported. At the meeting, held to discuss a new asylum seeker shelter, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entered the country, Lübcke reportedly said: “One has to stand up for values here. And those who don’t do so can leave this country any time, if they don’t like it. That’s the freedom of every German.” It is not clear whether Ernst attended the meeting, but a video of Lübcke’s comments was reportedly circulated in far-right forums and was mentioned at rallies by the anti-immigration Pegida movement at the height of the migration crisis. Investigators believe Ernst had contact with the far-right NPD party, as well as the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, whose members are known for promoting violence, hoarding weapons and spreading far-right propaganda and bomb-making guides. He served a prison sentence after attempting to plant a pipe bomb outside a home for asylum seekers in 1993. He was arrested 10 years ago at a neo-Nazi march in Dortmund and sentenced to seven months’ probation for breaching the peace. Extremists and neo-Nazis have posted messages online appearing to applaud Lübcke’s murder, stoking fears that a wider networkcould have been involved in the killing. The killing has deeply shaken Germany and raised questions about whether the country has failed to take seriously a rising threat from neo-Nazis. Ernst has claimed he acted alone, but Seehofer said investigators would continue to hunt for possible accomplices or co-conspirators. “The investigation of this political murder is not yet complete,” Seehofer said. He promised to “do everything humanly possible to investigate this terrible act”, adding: “We will continue to work hard to establish whether there were accessories or even accomplices. We owe that to the public.”"
2019-10-16T13:50:52Z,Italian coastguard finds bodies of migrants who drowned at sea,"Italian authorities have found the bodies of at least 12 people who drowned last week after a boat capsized in rough seas off the island of Lampedusa. Photos released by the Italian coastguard showed some of the clothed bodies floating at a depth of about 60 metres (200ft). Among them was a woman who drowned while embracing her child of about eight months. On Tuesday last week, Italian authorities rescued 22 survivors from the boat, which was carrying about 50 people. The bodies of 13 women were found at the time, including that of a 12-year-old girl. But after testimony from those who survived, it was clear dozens of people, including eight children, were missing. According to an initial reconstruction of events, all the people onboard moved to one end of the vessel as the rescue boat arrived, causing it to overturn. Survivors said the boat had initially left Libya carrying mostly people from sub-Saharan Africa, before sailing along the coast to reach the city of Sfax in Tunisia, where another 15 people boarded for the journey to Sicily. The site of the wreck was finally located on Tuesday and the bodies will be recovered in the next few days. The Agrigento prosecutor, Salvatore Vella, who is leading the investigation into the incident and the search operation, said: “We believed in it until the end. “The divers did not give up for a single day. They put all their heart into returning the bodies of loved ones to their relatives.” The news has shaken Italy, particularly because of the high number of children onboard. Prosecutors have released some of the harrowing accounts of survivors. Among those was that of a young Tunisian called Wissen. When the boat sank, the man recovered the body of a child who had been onboard. But suddenly, he recounted, another person desperately clung to his legs to try to save himself, risking dragging Wissen down with him. Wissen had to let go of the child to unfasten his trousers, and the other person drowned. Wissen was saved but could no longer find the child. Although the number of arrivals has practically halved, thousands of people continue to attempt the crossing from Libya to Europe. On Tuesday, the Italian coastguard assisted a boat with 180 people onboard, while Maltese authorities aided another boat carrying 75 people. On Wednesday, the Norwegian-flagged Ocean Viking docked in Taranto with 176 people onboard. The vessel, operated by the charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières, had rescued them at sea about 30 miles (48km) off the Libyan coast. While EU member states are working on a temporary plan to quickly take people off boats in the Mediterranean and distribute them among countries willing to accommodate them, there has been significant criticism in Italy of a human trafficker participating in a meeting with authorities. Abd al-Rahman Milad, known as Bija – described by the UN as one of the world’s most notorious human traffickers – met Italian officials and a delegation from the Libyan coastguard at Cara di Mineo, one of the biggest migrant reception centres in Europe, in May 2017. In February of that year, the then Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, signed a memorandum with the leader of Libya’s UN-recognised government, Fayez al-Sarraj, introducing a new level of cooperation between the Libyan coastguard and Italy, including the provision of four patrol vessels. Despite Italian authorities denying their involvement in the meeting, the UN migration agency has confirmed it was requested by the interior ministry. Bija was reached by the Italian newspaper Avvenire, which first reported the case. In the interview, the trafficker said he was “offended by how the media have described him” and that he was “coming to that meeting only to discuss how to block the flow of migrants”."
2019-10-22T23:01:18Z,Refugee age rows having 'devastating impact' on children,"Age disputes are having a “devastating impact” on unaccompanied and separated refugee or asylum seeker children arriving in the UK, the UN refugee agency has warned. Evidence from an assessment conducted by the UNHCR found disputes over a refugee or asylum seeker’s age impeded and delayed access to services and environments that can assist integration. Children whose ages are in dispute are liable to be placed in inappropriate accommodation together with adults, posing a risk to their safety, the report said, and are likely to be denied access to education. The mental and physical health of such children may deteriorate, they are at increased risk of absconding or being trafficked, and of being detained as an adult in an immigration removal centre, the report said. “For many children, these initial mistakes take at least months, and often years, to correct,” the report said. “In the meantime, children are exposed to harmful and protracted disputes, not only denied the support to which they are legally entitled, but also forced to challenge the very people charged to look after them.” The assessment identified numerous cases where asylum seekers, initially judged to be adults, were later determined to be children as young as 15. International best practice specifies that age assessment procedures should only be undertaken as a measure of last resort, when there are grounds for serious doubt about the person’s age and once informed consent has been obtained. Prior to the assessment, all age-disputed individuals should be given the benefit of the doubt and treated as a child unless this would be clearly unreasonable. But the UNHCR report said significant changes in UK policy and practice were required to bring age-assessment processes in line with these principles. The report was one of three commissioned by the European commission and published by the UNHCR on Wednesday. They make the case for taking steps to ensure unaccompanied or separated child refugees and asylum seekers arriving in the UK can more quickly recover from trauma. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it. We take our responsibilities towards unaccompanied children extremely seriously and, in the past 12 months, we gave protection to more than 7,000 children. “Our approach to age-disputed cases strikes the sensitive balance between ensuring that children who claim asylum are supported while maintaining the integrity of the asylum system. “When there is doubt about whether someone is an adult or a child, they will be referred to a local authority’s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.”"
2019-09-10T15:04:28Z,‘Life-saving’: hundreds of refugees to be evacuated from Libya to Rwanda,"Hundreds of African refugees and asylum seekers trapped in Libyan detention centres will be evacuated to Rwanda under a “life-saving” agreement reached with Kigali and the African Union, the UN refugee agency said on Tuesday. The first group of 500 people, including children and young people from Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan, are expected to arrive in Rwanda over the coming days, out of 4,700 now estimated to be in custody in Libya, where conflict is raging. The measure is part of an “emergency transit mechanism”, to evacuate people at risk of harm in detention centres inside the county. Babar Baloch, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, said the agreement was “a life-line” mechanism to allow those in danger to get to a place of safety. “This is an expansion of the humanitarian evacuation to save lives,” said Baloch. “The focus is on those trapped inside Libya. We’ve seen how horrible the conditions are and we want to get them out of harm’s way.” More than 50,000 people fleeing war and poverty in Africa remain in Libya, where a network of militias run overcrowded detention centres, and where there are reports that people have been sold as slaves or into prostitution. The UN denied reports the European Union were behind the agreement, as part of a strategy to keep migrants away from Europe. Vincent Cochetel, the special envoy for the UNHCR for the central Mediterranean, told Reuters the funding would mainly come from the EU, but also from the African Union which has received $20m (£16m) from Qatar to support the reintegration of African migrants. But he later said on Twitter that no funding had yet been received and that he was working on it “with partners”. Baloch said: “We are asking for support from all of our donors, including the EU. The arrangement is between UNHCR, the African Union and Rwanda.” The EU has been criticised for funding the Libyan coastguard, who pick up escaped migrants from boats in the Mediterranean and send them back to centres where they face beatings, sexual violence and forced labour according to rights groups. In July, the bombing of a migrant detention centre in Tripoli left 44 people dead, leading to international pressure to find a safe haven for refugees. Under the agreement, the government of Rwanda will receive and provide protection to refugees and asylum seekers in groups of about 50, who will be put up in a transit facility outside the capital of Kigali. After their arrival, the UNHCR will continue to pursue solutions for them. Some will be resettled to third countries, others helped to return to countries where asylum had previously been granted and others will stay in Rwanda. They will return to their homes if it is safe to do so. Cochetel said: “The government has said, ‘If you [UNHCR] think the people should stay long-term in Rwanda, no problem. If you think they should be reunited with their family, they should be resettled, no problem. You [UNHCR] decide on the solution.’” “Rwanda has said, ‘We’ll give them the space, we’ll give them the status, we’ll give them the residence permit. They will be legally residing in Rwanda as refugees.’” Rwanda, a country of 12 million, is the second African country to provide temporary refuge to migrants in Libya. It already supports around 150,000 refugees from neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. UNHCR has evacuated more than 2,900 refugees and asylum seekers out of Libya to Niger through an existing emergency transit mechanism. Almost 2,000 of them have been resettled, to countries in Europe, the US and Canada, the agency said, with the rest remaining in Niger."
2019-07-03T17:30:31Z,Why attack on Libya detention centre was grimly predictable,"Shocking as the precise circumstances are behind the deaths of at least 44 people in an airstrike that hit a detention centre in Tajoura in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, it is a predictable incident. Even as footage circulated online claiming to show blood and body parts mixed with rubble and migrants’ belongings from the air raid blamed on the forces of the warlord Khalifa Haftar, it emerged the detainees had been housed in a hangar next to a weapons store – the likely target of the strike. EU officials have long been aware of the risks in Libya, where migrants have faced atrocious mistreatment at the hands of militias, while Europe’s governments have prevented the sailing of migrant boats to Italy and elsewhere. Critics point to the EU’s decision to withdraw the naval assets involved in Operation Sophia, which provided a vital role in saving lives at sea, saying this has led to thousands more people being detained or trapped in facilities such as the one in Tajoura. In recent months, since Haftar and his self-styled National Liberation Forces launched their assault on the UN-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj in Tripoli, alarm bells over the safety of migrants had only grown louder. About 3,000 are housed in locations close to the fighting where migrants have already been killed. In the case of the Tajoura facility, the UN’s refugee agency, the UNHCR, noted it had warned less than two months ago that anyone inside the detention centre was at risk of being caught in the fighting around Tripoli. Amnesty had also warned of the risk of detaining migrants close to a military site after an airstrike hit a military vehicle about 100 metres from the detention centre on 7 May. Last month, it was the turn of the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights, whose spokesman, Rupert Colville, outlined a litany of abuses and dangers facing migrants detained in Libya, often after being intercepted by the EU-supported Libyan coastguard. Among the abuses Colville listed were reports of detainees dying untreated from tuberculosis in “ghastly conditions”, including 22 people in the Zintan facility south of Tripoli since September. Some, Colville said, appeared to have been sent deliberately to facilities close to the frontline, while others still had simply disappeared amid suspicions they had been trafficked after their detention into forced labour, for sexual exploitation or passed on again to smugglers offering transit to Europe. As the New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch made clear in a scathing report published in January titled No Escape from Hell, none of this should come as much of a surprise to officials. Two years ago, the EU’s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, was compelled to acknowledge the shocking state of the detention centres in Libya and the widespread abuses, even as the bloc continued to support the anti-migration efforts at sea of Libyan authorities. “We are all conscious of the appalling and degrading conditions in which some migrants are held in Libya,” said Avramopoulos, conditions that have barely improved while the risks to those held in them have mounted. In July 2018, when Human Rights Watch researchers visited four detention centres in Tripoli, Misrata and Zuwara, they documented what they described as “inhumane conditions that included severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, poor quality food and water”, as well as “disturbing accounts of violence by guards, including beatings, whippings and use of electric shocks”. Commenting in the aftermath of the airstrike, Elinor Raikes of the International Rescue Committee called for detention centres to be evacuated. “This devastating development is a testament to the immense vulnerability of the refugees and migrants who remain trapped inside detention centres across Libya,” she said. “The fear and horror felt by those trapped in Tajoura and across Libya is unimaginable. People caught in detention centres must be evacuated to a place of safety outside Libya and search and rescue operations at sea immediately restored to protect those fleeing the violence. “A ceasefire is urgently needed. European governments and the US must recognise their role in bringing the warring parties back to the negotiating table.”"

2019-10-08T15:04:33Z,13 women dead and eight children missing after boat capsizes off Italy,"At least 13 women have died and eight children are missing after a boat capsized in rough seas off the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday night as a patrol vessel attempted to save it. Italian authorities have rescued 22 survivors from the boat, which was carrying about 50 people. Only four of the 13 recovered bodies have been identified by surviving family members, including that of a 12-year-old girl. According to an initial reconstruction of events, all the people onboard moved to one end of the vessel as the rescue boat arrived, causing it to overturn. The boat, carrying mostly people from sub-Saharan Africa, had initially left Libya before sailing along the coast to reach the city of Sfax, in Tunisia, where another 15 people boarded before they continued their journey to Sicily, according to survivors. Sicilian prosecutors from Agrigento who are investigating the shipwreck emphasise that, for some time now, the route from Tunisia has been increasingly favoured by refugees and migrants attempting to reach Europe. “People are leaving from Libya less and less and as a result the vast majority of migrants come from Tunisia,” the Agrigento prosecutor, Salvatore Vella, said. About 2,500 people have arrived in Italy by sea from north Africa in September, and almost all of them left from Tunisia, usually from the coastal city of Zarzis. The arrivals by sea to Italy in September represent a third of the 7,637 who have landed since the start of the year, according to data from the Interior Ministry. The Tunisia route, though shorter than from Libya, can, however, be more risky. “The goal for those departing from Tunisia is to reach the Sicilian coast directly and evade controls,” said Vella. “This means that migrants do not launch an SOS as has happened from those leaving Libya. This, of course, makes the journey more dangerous.” They are called “phantom landings” and for some years now they have been an increasingly common way of travelling with boats, upon landing, often abandoned on Sicilian beaches. Meanwhile in Brussels, the migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, urged member states to back a temporary plan to quickly get migrants off boats in the Mediterranean Sea and distribute them among willing countries. Germany, France, Italy and Malta are seeking approval from their EU partners for a “fast-track” process to screen migrants, relocate asylum-seekers and return people who do not qualify for asylum. “It’s a moment for all member states to show more solidarity and more responsibility,” Avramopoulos told reporters in Luxembourg, “We cannot continue like this with what is happening in the Mediterranean. We need permanent mechanisms,” he said. The 27 ministers – minus the UK - were also confronted with a stark warning that the eastern Mediterranean shows signs of an “emerging crisis”, following a rise in people seeking asylum. Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus – three countries facing increased numbers of asylum seekers arriving via sea and land from Turkey – issued a joint paper that said: “Although the current situation is different from the crisis of 2015 to early 2016, it contains alarming elements of an emerging crisis. Europe cannot be caught unprepared for a second time.” The three countries urge the EU to devote more funds to migration in its next seven-year budget to help them manage the flow of people. Separately, a leaked document from the European commission revealed that Greece was recording the highest number of weekly arrivals since spring 2016, when a controversial EU-Turkey deal took effect. In March 2016, the EU promised to pay €6bn to refugee charities in Turkey, if Ankara took action to prevent people getting on people smugglers’ boats. Numbers fell dramatically, but have risen sharply in 2019: in August almost 8,000 asylum seekers arrived in Greece over the sea, compared with about 5,000 in July. Greece is also facing a sharp increase in asylum seekers travelling over its land border with Turkey, with arrivals more than doubling to 1,500 in August (compared with the previous month). About three-quarters of people using the land route are Turkish nationals. More than 1 million migrants arrived in the EU in 2015, most of them from Syria or Iraq, sparking one of Europe’s biggest political crises in recent times as nations bickered over who should take responsibility for them. “A strong agreement will help save lives and demonstrate that EU countries are committed to working together to uphold basic values and international obligations,” said the Amnesty migration researcher, Matteo de Bellis. Since 2013, almost 20,000 migrants have died trying to reach Europe."
2019-11-13T15:13:42Z,"Greek refugee camp for 640 people is found to be housing 3,745","An EU-funded refugee camp on the Greek island of Samos built to house 640 people is home to 3,745, with unaccompanied children forced to sleep on the floor of windowless and overcrowded containers, an official audit has revealed. Other children were found to be living in makeshift tents or in derelict buildings on the outskirts of the camp in what the special report from the European court of auditors described as “dire conditions”. “Seventy-eight unaccompanied minors were in tents or abandoned derelict houses outside the hot spot, in unofficial extensions to the facility,” the auditors said. “Nine unaccompanied girls were sleeping on the floor in a 10 metre sq container next to the police office, with no bathroom or shower.” The situation at Greek facilities on Samos and at the island of Lesbos are described as “highly critical in terms of capacity and the situation of unaccompanied minors”, due to a failure of the bloc’s relocation and return scheme for migrants coming to Europe from countries such as Syria. The auditors’ findings were echoed on Wednesday in appeals made by the mayor of Samos, Georgios Stantzos, who warned of riots due to the “primitive” conditions. Last month, a fire broke out in the camp after a brawl in town between rival groups of Syrians and Afghans. “People are camping in dry stream beds,” Stantzos told Agence France-Presse. “They are at risk from fires and floods. [Camp residents] organise their own housing, water supply and sanitation in completely primitive ways. We are trying to remain calm but the situation is not manageable ... it gets worse every day. We are past the red line. Any random event ... could lead to terrible results. At the peak of the migration crisis, EU countries set a target of relocating 160,000 newly arrived migrants. Member states later legally agreed to revise down the plan to relocate 98,256 people. Of those, only 34,705 – 21,999 from Greece and 12,706 from Italy – were found new homes in the EU. Countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have refused to fulfil their obligations. The auditors found that relocation schemes in Italy and Greece, which is the focus of their report, had underperformed mainly due to the very low share of potentially eligible migrants registering for relocation. Authorities were said to be unable to identify all potential candidates and successfully channel them towards applying for relocation. But there were also major systemic problems making the schemes unattractive to applicants. In Greece, people seeking relocation from camps waited an average of 215 days from application to decision last year. A shortage of doctors to assess the vulnerability of applicants was said to be a key factor. In Italy, the large number of appeals against decisions has led to a backlog. The auditors said it took on average over four years for an asylum application lodged in 2015 to reach the final appeal stage. The problems have led to unacceptable conditions in the camps, where the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières reported an increase in claims of harassment, sexual assault and other forms of violence. The European court of auditors made their visit to the camps in February. The European commission has accepted a series of recommendations in the report, including the upgrading of facilities. However, a formal response published alongside the report added that “the responsibility to establish a sustainable system for unaccompanied minors lies with the Greek authorities, and not with the commission”. Leo Brincat, a member of the team responsible for the report, called for all EU institutions and member states to step up and avoid passing the buck."
2019-01-15T07:00:11Z,UN refugee chief: I would risk death to escape a squalid migrant camp,"The head of the UN refugee agency has said he too would do “anything” to escape if he was stuck in a squalid refugee camp, as he called on the world’s wealthy nations to properly fund services in developing countries. Speaking to reporters after meeting the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Filippo Grandi, the high commissioner for refugees, said countries are not getting enough recognition for hosting refugees, and that he would campaign for Cairo to receive more bilateral development aid to support its efforts. According to the latest figures, Egypt hosts more than 242,000 registered refugees of 58 different nationalities, mainly concentrated in Greater Cairo, Alexandria and the north coast, 55% of them fleeing the war in Syria. While migrant flows to Europe across the dangerous Mediterranean sea route had fallen sharply, Grandi said, that decline had not reduced the number of people fleeing war and poverty flocking to holding camps in places like Libya. “If I was a refugee or a migrant or anybody going into this centre I would opt for anything to get out of there, even if I knew the risk of death was very high,” Grandi said, adding that what Libya needed was help to enforce the rule of law instead of just naval support, as well as aid to stop illegal people trafficking. Seeking similar arrangements to those in eastern Europe, EU leaders have been urging Egypt to help stem the flow of people entering Europe from Africa, offering to step up economic cooperation as an incentive. Cairo, however, has stopped short of setting up the “disembarkation platforms” Europe seeks, where people rescued at sea could be dropped off for screening. Grandi made his comments as Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms said on Monday that Spanish authorities were preventing its ship from setting sail in the Mediterranean. “We are blocked in a port once again. Port Authority in Barcelona denied permission to Open Arms to sail Med Central,” the charity wrote in a tweet. “Preventing us from saving lives is irresponsible and cruel. Cowardly politicians are putting in place a counter for the dead,” added Proactiva Open Arms founder Oscar Camps in a separate tweet. Proactiva Open Arms operates between Libya and southern Europe, coming to the aid of those who get into difficulties during the crossing from northern Africa. The charity’s ship, the Open Arms, docked in southern Spain on 28 December, with 311 mainly African migrants it had plucked from the sea off Libya, after both Italy and Malta denied the boat entry. Spanish authorities said the vessel had violated maritime regulations by ignoring “the obligation to leave those rescued at sea at the nearest port”. Spain became Europe’s main entry point for refugees last year, overtaking Greece and Italy, which have taken measures to prevent those rescued from landing in its ports."
2019-11-05T18:21:49Z,France to set migrant worker quotas in bid to appeal to rightwing voters,"France will start setting quotas for migrant workers from next year as Emmanuel Macron toughens his stance on immigration in an apparent attempt to appeal to rightwing voters. The French labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, said on Tuesday that France would set quotas for the first time, with the government working with employers to identify industries lacking qualified candidates and where foreigners could fill the gap. “This is about France hiring based on its needs. It’s a new approach, similar to what is done in Canada or Australia,” Penicaud told BFMTV. She did not say how many foreign workers would be granted visas, nor if an applicant’s nationality would be taken into account, a proposal floated last month by the prime minister, Édouard Philippe. The quotas were presented as a way to simplify the hiring process for businesses. Currently, employers have to take part in a complex administrative process and justify why a French citizen cannot be hired for a position they intend to give to a foreign worker needing a visa. With Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally hoping to make gains in local elections in March and Le Pen still seen as Macron’s main political rival in the run up to 2022 presidential elections, the centrist president has recently begun focusing on immigration and hardening his stance. The number of foreigners in France is not the main worry of the electorate – who are more concerned about making ends meet and growing fears over the climate crisis – but Le Pen’s anti-immigration party continues to focus on the issue and is seeking to win over voters from the mainstream right. Macron, who was elected with support from voters on both the right and left, appears to be preparing the ground for a second presidential stand-off with Le Pen, seeking to address rightwing voters who complain there are too many foreigners in France. Macron has steadily heightened his rhetoric on immigration since September, when he told Europe 1 radio: “France cannot host everyone if it wants to host people well. In order to be able to welcome everyone properly, we should not be too attractive a country.” The question of setting quotas for economic migrants was an idea of the former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 but was never put in place. Macron distanced himself from the idea of quotas during the 2017 election campaign andpraised the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for “saving our collective dignity” by allowing in large numbers of refugees. However, he recently sparked criticism on the left when he gave an interview focused on immigration and Islam to the conservative weekly magazine Valeurs Actuelles, where his views were considered as appealing to readers on the right and far right. When an outraged voter criticised Macron for doing the interview, he said: “You have to speak to everyone.” The prime minister, will unveil a series of measures on Wednesday after France received a record 122,743 asylum requests last year, up 22% from the year before. The new measures could include restrictions on migrants bringing over family members or limiting access to health care for asylum seekers while their claims are processed. France has also called for an overhaul of the EU’s efforts to halt the surge of migrants fleeing conflict and poverty in Asia, the Middle East and Africa since 2015. The French president wants more EU members to share the burden of taking in migrants allowed to stay, a move opposed by several countries in eastern and central Europe. But Macron sparked anger from Bulgaria’s government last week after he said he wanted legal migrants from Guinea or Ivory Coast rather than “clandestine networks of Bulgarians and Ukrainians”."
2020-09-12T07:36:58Z,UK urged to take in refugees after fire at Lesbos migrant camp,"Pressure is mounting on the UK government to take in some of the thousands of asylum seekers left without shelter following a devastating fire at Europe’s largest migrant camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. The blaze tore through the Moria registration and identification centre (RIC) overnight on Tuesday, incinerating tents that had been home to 13,000 people, including at least 4,000 children. Germany and France are to take in children hit by the fire but the UK has yet to offer any assistance. Since last October, the Greek government has been appealing for help from other countries to take in asylum-seeking children from its islands; 13 countries, including non-EU states Norway and Switzerland, have taken part but the UK has refused to help. The fire has made the situation on Lesbos even more critical. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, urged the government to act. He said: “The government should live up to our responsibilities and promises as a country and look to work with international partners so we can immediately offer sanctuary and home to some of the unaccompanied children in this terrible situation.” More than 70 civil society organisations have signed a call for action urging governments to take in people displaced by the Moria camp fire. Stephanie Pope, EU and UN policy and advocacy manager at Refugee Rights Europe, said: “While we are shocked and saddened by the horrific images of Moria burning, they come as no surprise. The devastating fires are yet another reminder of the tragic human cost of a European asylum and migration system based on containment and deterrence policies. “Thousands of individuals, including roughly 4,000 children, have been left homeless and traumatised. We urge all European governments including the UK, to uphold their commitment to human rights and show solidarity with these individuals, by relocating a number of them to safety without delay.” Ruth Tanner, the head of Oxfam’s humanitarian campaigns, said: “The ongoing humanitarian tragedy in the camp and now this devastating fire are an urgent reminder to the UK government that it should be doing its fair share for people fleeing conflict and persecution. “The UK’s resettlement operations, which were paused due to the pandemic, should be urgently restarted. The UK government needs to provide adequate safe and legal routes for refugees to reach the UK and allow more refugee families to be reunited in safety here.” In a letter to the home secretary, Lord Dubs, who was a child refugee himself, said: “The situation in Greece is an international emergency and it requires international cooperation to find a solution. As a leading nation on the world stage, I hope the UK will play its role in making sure that children are relocated from this horrendous situation as soon as possible.” In 2016, after defeats in the House of Lords, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed byDubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The process was subsequently referred to as the Dubs scheme. The government capped the Dubs scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this. The cap has been met so the scheme has in effect ended; however, the legislation remains and the government could take more children under the scheme if it chose to do so. The tragedy underlines the importance of establishing a credible replacement for European laws – known as the Dublin regulation – which govern family reunion for unaccompanied minors who have relatives in the UK, campaigners say. When the transition period ends on 31 December, so will the UK’s obligations under the Dublin regulation. The UK also suspended its global resettlement scheme, designed to transfer recognised refugees from an another country, due to the pandemic and has yet to restart it. Refugees International advocate Daphne Panayotatos, said: “The devastation caused by the fires in Moria has only underscored what the world already knew about the indignity, unsustainability and danger of holding people in the miserable conditions in Lesbos. “The UK and other European countries have taken only minimal steps in response to Greece’s requests for assistance. By keeping resettlement operations on hold, the UK has further abdicated its responsibility to people seeking safety in Europe. With tens of thousands in Lesbos now left with nowhere to go, the UK should immediately step up to take in more vulnerable asylum seekers, resume resettlement, and facilitate family reunification.”"
2020-09-10T17:00:09Z,EU official says asylum policy impasse 'part of the problem' at Moria,"A senior EU official has said Europe’s failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy was partly responsible for the “unacceptable” conditions at the Moria camp on Lesbos that burned to the ground this week, leaving more than 12,000 people without shelter. Ylva Johansson, the European commissioner for home affairs, said that when she took office in December 2019, the situation for 40,000 refugees and migrants living on Greek islands was “unsustainable and unacceptable”. Asked whether Moria – long notorious for overcrowded, filthy conditions – was a result of the commission’s past actions, she said: “Migrant camps on Greek soil are primarily the responsibility of the Greek government.” She added: “The failure [of] the previous commission to actually reach a common European migration and asylum policy is also part of the problem.” Speaking to the Guardian and other European newspapers, Johansson said: “We sometimes say that Europe does not have a migration crisis, and we don’t have that right now. But some migrants are in crisis and that has been the situation in some of these camps.” Following the disastrous fire at Moria, the European commission has promised to fund the transfer of 400 lone children to the Greek mainland, and it is sending a ferry to shelter the most vulnerable people. Johansson highlighted the commission’s actions, working with Athens, to reduce the number of refugees and migrants on the Greek islands, saying the population of Moria had been reduced by almost half in six months: “We were not sitting on our butt to wait for this to happen.” The Swedish social democrat has been charged with drawing up new migration and asylum rules in an effort to heal the open wound over who takes responsibility for people arriving at Europe’s southern borders. The long-delayed migration and asylum pact due on 30 September will propose how frontline countries such as Greece, Italy and Malta can be better helped by their EU neighbours in managing large numbers of arrivals. Johansson declined to confirm whether that meant a legally binding obligation on EU countries to take in refugees – an idea behind some of Europe’s most bitter divisions. She said the problems at Moria were caused “not only” by failure to agree a relocation policy, but also by the absence of swift processes to assess asylum claims and effective means to return people rejected for refugee status to their country of origin. In 2019 the average asylum seeker in Greece could expect to wait nearly 11 months to get an interview to assess their claim after declaring their intention to seek refugee status, according to the Greek Council for Refugees. At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, the EU pushed through compulsory refugee quotas in the face of opposition from some central European countries, which flatly refused to shelter asylum seekers. An attempt to reform the system in 2016, based on the idea of mandatory solidarity payments by refusenik countries, foundered. The commissioner, a former employment and integration minister, also said she would like EU monitoring to prevent illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at the EU border. In May, the Guardian found that Malta was using private companies to intercept migrant boats and return potential asylum seekers to Libya. Amid escalating tensions with Turkey, the Greek government was reported by the New York Times to have set up a “black site” where migrants were held without legal recourse before being pushed back into Turkey. “I am very concerned about reports of pushbacks,” Johansson said. “For me it is a fundamental right to have a right to apply for asylum … and that’s why I am considering introducing a monitoring mechanism in the pact to make sure that people have this right at the borders.” She did not give details on how that mechanism might work. The migration pact is expected to intensify EU efforts to return failed asylum seekers to their country of origin, as well as proposing legal routes for people seeking to work in Europe. The EU will also put more attention on taking refugees from non-EU countries via resettlement programmes. The ideas will only come into force with the consent of EU governments. Despite low expectations, Johansson said she was optimistic about finding a compromise on this “very, very difficult exercise”, citing the agreement on the coronavirus recovery plan that had sharply divided member states. “But I guess when I present my pact, nobody would be happy,” she added."
2020-10-20T12:12:38Z,Greece extends wall on Turkish border as refugee row deepens,"Greece has begun extending a border wall along its frontier with Turkey to deter migrants from trying to enter the European Union, the Greek government has said, after a border standoff earlier this year which has helped drive Greek-Turkish relations to a dangerously low ebb. A total of 16 miles (26km) of wall will be added to the existing 6 mile fence along the Evros River, which forms much of the Greek-Turkish border, the government spokesperson Stelios Petsas said on Monday. The €63m (£57.5m) extension will add 5 metre-high fencing and upgrade the existing sections of the wall by using galvanized square steel tubes and concrete foundations, Petsas said. The work is due to be completed in April. Turkey hosts around 4 million refugees, mostly from Syria. It often threatens to reopen the migrant route from the Middle East, which at its peak in 2015 resulted in thousands of people drowning in the Mediterranean Sea and about 1 million people reaching Greece and Italy where many still live in crowded displacement camps. In February this year, Ankara declared it would no longer stop migrants from trying to cross into Europe, in an attempt to pressure its western allies into supporting a Turkish military campaign in Syria’s Idlib province. As a result, tens of thousands of refugees and migrants living in Turkey attempted to cross by land and sea to Greece and Bulgaria in March, although the movement was quickly halted by the outbreak of coronavirus. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 7,357 people crossed from Turkey into Greece in the first quarter of 2020 - only slightly higher than the figures recorded in the same period of the previous year, although deaths at sea increased from 19 to 67 people. The standoff, however, has still led to tougher border control tactics. Turkey has accused Greece of illegally pushing back migrants reaching its islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, a charge Athens denies, while Greece says Turkey sends patrol vessels to escort migrant boats into its waters. Greek police told the Associated Press they had started trialling high-powered mobile sirens aimed at deterring migrants as they attempted to cross from Turkey, and an upgraded surveillance camera network is also planned to cover the entire 120 mile Greek-Turkish border. “The cameras will be a vital resource for us,” said Ilias Akidis, the head of the police officers’ association in the Greek border region. “We have been asking for them for five years and we think they will be very effective.” The plight of refugees and migrants has been steadily weaponised by Turkish and Greek politicians over the last five years. Relations between the two countries, frosty at the best of times, have fallen into a deepening crisis in recent months. Disagreements over Cyprus, refugee flows and oil and gas drilling rights in the Mediterranean have drawn in other countries in the region, and for the first time in decades prompted fears of direct clashes between the two Nato allies."
2020-12-23T16:16:50Z,Fire destroys migrant camp in Bosnia,"A fast-moving fire has destroyed a migrant camp in Bosnia strongly criticised by rights groups as inadequate due to its lack of resources. The blaze broke out at the Lipa camp, close to the border with Croatia, on the same day the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had declared the effective closure of the facility, saying Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to supply basic services. Thick black smoke could be seen rising as residents, mainly from the Middle East, south Asia and north Africa, fled in panic. A UN official said the blaze was believed to have been started by migrants unhappy at the camp’s temporary closure. “As far as we know now, a group of former residents put three tents and containers on fire after most of the migrants had left the camp,” said Peter Van der Auweraert of the IOM. He said to his knowledge there were no casualties. The IOM has urged Bosnian authorities to make the camp fit for winter and offer an alternative shelter option while the work is being conducted. Hundreds of migrants, including children, are now left without shelter as temperatures in Bosnia are expected to go as low as -4C. Bosnia has become a bottleneck for thousands of migrants hoping to reach the EU. Most are concentrated in the country’s north-western Bosanska Krajina region as other regions in the ethnically divided nation refuse to accept them. From there they attempt to cross the border with Croatia into the EU, and contend with pushbacks. Bosnian authorities ordered the transfer of thousands of migrants to the remote temporary camp in March at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. A few weeks ago, when temperatures fell to -6C, more than 1,400 people were still living in the camp. The shower and toilet facilities had frozen and people were forced to use the surrounding woods to relieve themselves. The EU has warned Bosnia that thousands of migrants face a freezing winter without shelter, and urged the country’s political authorities to set aside their differences and take action. But others believe that behind the incident in Lipa a deep political rift is developing between the UN and the EU, and the Bosnian authorities. Attempts to reopen another camp, Bira, in the Bihać region have run into opposition after it was closed at the end of September by the Una-Sana canton authorities. “What is happening in Bihać is a political crisis that has been brewing for nearly two years,” said Paola Lucchesi, a former journalist based in Bihać and president of the NGO Centar za Odrzivi Razvoj “Una”. “In the last two months, a standoff between the cantonal and municipal authorities and the IOM, that acts as an operational partner for the EU commission, has escalated to the point of a full-blown constitutional crisis within the country,” she added."
2020-12-22T10:30:13Z,Alarm at  Colombia plan to exclude migrants from coronavirus vaccine,"Colombia will refuse to administer coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan refugees within its borders, President Iván Duque has announced, in a move which stunned public health experts and prompted condemnation from humanitarian groups. Speaking to a local radio station on Monday, Duque that only Venezuelans with dual nationality or formal migratory status will have access to the vaccine when it is eventually distributed in the country. According to migration authorities, Colombia currently houses 1.7 million Venezuelans who have fled political repression, economic ruin and widespread food and medicine shortages. Only about 45% have formal status, and hundreds more cross the border unofficially every day. Duque said the controversial decision was taken to prioritize Colombians, and to prevent a rush on the border. “Imagine what we would live through,” he told Blu Radio on Monday morning. “We would have calls to stampede the border as everyone crosses asking for a vaccine.” But the comments prompted an immediate backlash. “Now is the time to show solidarity; vaccinating migrants and refugees costs less than their hospitalization in an intensive care unit,” said Juan Viloria, a Venezuelan doctor in Colombia and the coordinator of Coalition for Venezuela, a migrant rights group. “Not doing so puts thousands at risk, particularly those most vulnerable who do not have anywhere to isolate, wash their hands, or socially distance,” Viloria added. Meanwhile, Colombia faces a resurgent coronavirus outbreak, with cases climbing by over 10,000 a day following months of respite. Lockdowns and other restrictions over the Christmas period have been put in place by local mayors. “Not vaccinating Venezuelans is a bad idea from an epidemiological point of view,” tweeted Alejandro Gaviria, a public intellectual and the dean of Los Andes University in Bogotá. “But it is above all an unethical proposal: it excludes the most vulnerable and discriminates in an almost threatening way against a group of people because of their nationality and immigration status.” Colombia signed deals with the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and AstraZeneca last Friday to provide 20m doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Duque said at the time that rollout would begin “in the first weeks of 2021”. Andrés Cubillos-Novella, a professor of public health specializing in migration at the Javeriana University in Bogotá, warned that not vaccinating migrants and refugees would create broader problems for Colombia’s health response. “Many vulnerable migrants live among vulnerable Colombians, and much of that population will be put at risk: access to the vaccine is a question of human rights,” Cubillos-Novella said, adding that the government’s decision may have been made due to financial restraints. “Perhaps that is where international aid could step in.” The Colombian president’s announcement also flies in the face of advice from international organisations which have warned against leaving migrants and refugees behind in vaccination campaigns. “This decision is not ethical or effective,” said Marianne Menjivar, Colombia director for the International Rescue Committee. “We can’t beat Covid anywhere until we beat it everywhere, among all populations, especially those most vulnerable.”"
2020-10-27T20:10:07Z,Hostile rhetoric will not stop refugee children dying in the Channel,"After the death of Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler pictured washed up on a Turkish beach, many promises and commitments were made by global leaders to step up their response to the migrant crisis. But today, five years on, we are facing an identical tragedy, and much closer to the UK’s doorstep, raising the question: did Kurdi’s death change anything?’ A five-year-old and an eight-year-old died after falling into the Channel when the boat in which they were travelling, in an attempt to reach the UK, capsized. It is the worst tragedy of its kind in the Channel. Taking such a risk with one’s life, or children’s lives, will be beyond most people’s understanding. The conditions on Tuesday were particularly poor for a crossing, with rain and strong winds – most attempts are taken on calm, clear days. The reasons people risk such a dangerous journey are numerous. They are frequently fleeing torture or death in their home countries. The conditions in northern France are poor and worsening, despite the help many charities offer, with frequent raids on migrant camps, and poor access to healthcare, basic supplies, and legal assistance. Migrants and refugees are often running towards the comfort of family, hoping to be reunited with loved ones in the UK. Humanitarian groups, and some of Britain’s biggest cultural stars, are united in their belief that individuals will continue to want to travel to the UK for a wide variety of reasons. They say it is crucial that the UK government offers safe and legal routes for people to travel to the UK to claim asylum, as migrants cannot claim unless they are on British soil. There are few safe and legal routes. Refugee groups say family reunion rules protected by EU law, known as the Dublin III regulations, are the most effective. But when the transition period ends on 31 December, the UK will no longer offer this route and the EU has dismissed alternatives offered by the UK as “not very operational”. Last week, the government rejected a Lords’ amendment to its immigration bill that would ensure the provisions of the Dublin regulations would continue. Other “safe and legal routes” have been suggested by humanitarian groups and migration experts, none of which is being utilised by the UK government. In 2016, the government accepted an amendment to the immigration bill proposed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Alf Dubs requiring the Home Office to accept an unspecified number of unaccompanied child refugees from Europe for resettlement in the UK. The government capped the scheme at 480 children, although there was no legal requirement to do this and, as the cap has been met, the scheme has, in effect, ended. In October last year, Greece’s immigration minister, Michalis Chrisochoidis, asked fellow EU states to help. He wanted countries to take in some of the 4,000-plus unaccompanied children on Greek islands. The European commission ultimately responded and funded a scheme to transfer children off the Greek islands. So far more than 10 countries, including Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the EU, have taken part. But the UK has refused to help. Instead, ministers have taken a hardline approach, vowing to make the crossing “unviable”. The UK government has appointed “a clandestine channel threat commander” to tackle people smuggling and is investigating methods of physically blocking asylum seekers from attempting to cross the Channel. Ministers and officials have looked at using nets to disable boat engines, locking up migrants on oil rigs, sending them more than 5,000 miles away to Ascension Island in the south Atlantic, and using water cannon to create waves to push back vessels. This is set against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the government directed at asylum seekers, and those who wish to help them. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has called the asylum system “fundamentally broken” and promised new laws to deny asylum to those using illegal routes to enter the UK. All of which has caused dismay among humanitarian organisations, which do not doubt that migrants fleeing from dire circumstances will continue to take risks to reach the UK."
2020-11-30T13:17:49Z,Spain dismantles 'deplorable' migrant camp in Gran Canaria,"Spanish authorities on the island of Gran Canaria have emptied and begun dismantling the much-criticised dockside camp that was used to house thousands of migrants and refugees, as the Canary Islands continue to struggle with a huge rise in migration. The makeshift camp was set up in the town of Arguineguín in August amid a surge in the number of people making the dangerous Atlantic journey from Africa to Europe. So far this year, about 20,000 people have arrived by sea in the Canary Islands – 8,000 of them in November alone. The large volume of people put the archipelago’s reception infrastructure under severe strain and had left the Arguineguín camp accommodating up to 2,600 people in cramped and unsanitary conditions. On Friday, Spain’s public ombudsman called for the camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people’s basic rights. A judge described conditions in the camp as “deplorable”, while Human Rights Watch said they were “pretty awful”. Ángel Victor Torres, the regional president of the Canaries, announced that the “unsustainable” camp had been emptied on Sunday and was being taken down. The people accommodated there were moved to a new a camp in a former military base and to tourist hotels. “I celebrate [the dismantling], but there’s a lot left to do,” Torres wrote on Twitter. “It’s very important that we make sure these people who have risked their lives on the dangerous Atlantic crossing receive dignified and humane treatment. There also need to be controls in their countries of origin, and we need to fight the mafias and speed up transfers and repatriations.” The presence of the migrants and refugees had angered some residents, but Torres called for people on the archipelago to think about the islands’ own long history of migration, adding: “There’s no room for racism in the Canaries.” The mayor of Mogán, the municipality of which Arguineguín is part, said local people’s patience was running out and that the central government needed to move the 6,000 migrants and refugees who are currently being put up in hotels before the end of the year. Txema Santana, of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid, welcomed the closing of the camp but said much more needed to be done. “EU islands can’t only be a reception area where there are thousands of places [for migrants and refugees],” he said on Monday. “The plan for the Canaries will fail unless it includes quick, transparent and regular transfers to the Spanish mainland.” Earlier this month, Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the camp and spoke to some people who had been housed on the dock for more than two weeks. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland,” she told the Guardian. “Those are two very clear solutions.” According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. Eight people died last week when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries."
2020-09-13T17:09:23Z,Greece pledges migrants made homeless will be resettled within days,"Greece has pledged that migrants made homeless after devastating fires at Europe’s biggest refugee camp will be rehoused on the island “within days” in defiance of fierce opposition from locals. The country’s migration minister Notis Mitarachi said the process of resettling more than 12,500 men, women and children forced to flee the facility in Lesbos was well under way even if the coronavirus pandemic meant it was also taking longer. “It will take a few days but all the affected people will be moved into this temporary location behind me,” he told reporters at the site where authorities, with the aid of the army, have been racing to set up tents. “We hope to have 5,000 beds ready by the end of the day.” Rapid Covid-19 tests were being conducted before anyone entered to ensure it remained “a safe community”, Mitarachi said. Erected in a former firing range within view of the sea, the replacement camp is the government’s answer to the humanitarian emergency that exploded last week after fires erupted in the now-gutted holding centre in Moria. A series of blazes, starting on Tuesday, decimated the notoriously overcrowded facility forcing thousands of people into the surrounding countryside. In the chaos that ensued refugees have slept rough, many in makeshift shelters along the side of a stretch of road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital, under heavy police guard. Others had sought refuge in olive groves, churches, supermarket parking lots and even a local cemetery, as authorities and aid groups struggled to bring in water and food. The prospect of being relocated to a new site has been welcomed neither by the refugees, nor locals. Lesbos, which faces Turkey, has long been on the frontline of refugee arrivals. Close to a million displaced Syrians landed on its shores in dinghies and rickety boats at the height of the country’s civil war when Europe’s migrant crisis peaked. For migrants forced to endure lengthy waits for requests to be processed, the Aegean isle is not the promised land envisaged when they embarked on the often perilous journey to Europe. On Sunday, a day after riot police fired teargas at protesters, many refused to enter the new site for fear they would never leave. Mitarachi insisted that those remaining outside would not be transferred to the mainland. “The best solution for them to move on with asylum applications is in the camp,” he said, claiming the centre-right government’s migration policies were “tough but fair”. Fears of a surge in coronavirus cases has, say authorities, made it ever more vital that people living at the camp are found and tested. Prior to the infernos, 35 of Moria’s residents had been diagnosed with the virus, with the Greek migration minister telling reporters “there might be 200 cases … by now”. In Thessaloniki the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said the combination of the pandemic and the migration crisis had made for “an explosive mix” and blamed the fires on “overactive asylum seekers” hoping Moria’s destruction would see them being moved to Athens. But he also voiced optimism that the end of a facility long deplored by human rights groups for its appalling conditions could mark the beginning of a new era for Europe in its often bungled handling of the issue. “I want to believe that this tragedy is a warning bell for all,” he said, adding that, whatever happened, a new camp would be built on Lesbos with the help of Europe. “I’ve requested that the EU be involved in the management of the new centre wherever it is [on the island]. I’d like to see the flag of Greece and Europe flying from masts at it.” Athens has long complained that, aside from funds, it has received little solidarity from the 27-member bloc. “We can’t fail a second time as Europe in handling the migrant crisis,” Mitsotakis said."
2020-04-22T03:40:23Z,Migrants stranded in Queenstown as New Zealand lockdown sparks 'refugee crisis',"Thousands of migrants are stranded in the resort capital of Queenstown, unable to get home and unable to earn a living during the coronavirus lockdown. New Zealand has been in level-four lockdown for a month, meaning no one can leave their homes except to fetch essential supplies, or for a brief respite of exercise. According to the Salvation Army, most migrants in Queenstown are employed in the hospitality and restaurant sectors, and many live in overcrowded conditions, including boarding houses where relationships are under strain. Though wage subsidies have been available for some migrants, depending on their visa and employment conditions, others have been ineligible for government assistance and a record 5,000 people have applied for emergency help, including food and accommodation assistance. With most migrants unable to return to their home countries due to travel and lockdown restrictions, the situation is becoming akin to a “refugee crisis” the Salvation Army said – with about 6,000 people needing urgent help. The Salvation Army has experienced a 600% surge in demand for its services during lockdown. “We’re seeing week on week more extreme and more complicated measures of difficulty. It started off with ‘I have no money for food’, but it’s moving into ‘I have no money for rent, my power, firewood, winter clothing’ and the list just gets longer and longer,” said Lieutenant Andrew Wilson from the Salvation Army. “Many migrants cannot return home, either because their country is in total lockdown or they do not have the resources to pay for flights.” “We’ve had one case where the individual was made redundant two weeks before the level-four lockdown. They had booked flights to return to their home country but their flight was cancelled at the last minute. They are now stuck here with no means of returning home but is still required to pay for rent and outgoings.” Immigration New Zealand is involved in assisting some migrants, and the Salvation Army said it had the ability to “make sure these people don’t go hungry” but larger costs such as getting home, rent and bills were of major concern. Language barriers had also been “a significant issue”, and a number of families now had police and social services involved after lockdown domestic violence incidents, with some families having to be split up for safety reasons. Anu Kaolti from the Migrant Workers Association described the situation as a “powder keg”, and said there was great frustration among migrants that they couldn’t get government help – or get home. “We have been inundated with contact from migrants confused and looking for help,” said Kaloti, adding that many migrants were fired at the beginning of the lockdown. “It’s really dire and desperate circumstances that are beyond anyone’s control. People are still holding it together but the pressures are there, I don’t know how much longer they’ll be able to hold on.” Queenstown was looking at a minimum of a one-year economic downturn, with tourist numbers set to plummet as bans on foreign arrivals are in place. The goal now was to get as many migrants returned to their home countries as possible. Wilson said: “The best-case scenario is for the migrants to return home, or into alternative employment somewhere else in the country, but that’s still a long way off.” Queenstown District Lakes mayor Jim Boult has described the situation as an “unprecedented welfare crisis” and said he expected the 5,000 applications for welfare assistance to rise. “It’s almost too big to comprehend,” Boult told the local paper. “I have been speaking regularly with central government to emphasise the importance of supporting our migrant workers, who will be essential to our ultimate recovery and the future diversification of our economy.” Around the country food banks and welfare services say they are experiencing demand that they would usually only see around Christmas, and many families were surviving on basic foods such as baked beans and porridge."
2020-09-23T17:01:10Z,EU’s migration proposals draw anger on left and leave questions unanswered,"The EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, hopes migration will become just another “normal policy area”, even “boring”. Since more than 1 million refugees arrived in Europe in 2015, migration has been neither “boring” nor easy for the bloc. Leaders have flung accusations at each other, exposing painful divisions. In 2015, Italy’s then prime minister told his fellow leaders they were “time wasters”, who didn’t deserve to call themselves Europeans. Central European countries accused their neighbours of trying to “blackmail” them. The latest proposals are intended to fix a system senior EU officials admit is broken. The Moria camp that sheltered asylum seekers in squalid conditions before it burned to the ground was described as “a stark reminder” that the old system no longer works, by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. While not the “entirely new architecture” billed, the new proposals mark a break with the past. The EU executive has abandoned the idea of mandatory refugee quotas that proved so toxic in 2015, but insists countries cannot do nothing. Governments that refuse refugees and asylum seekers can instead opt to return people denied asylum to their country of origin, an idea described as “return sponsorship”. For the left and some liberals, this compromise is evidence of an authoritarian drift. “The far right has captured EU migration policy,” said Dutch liberal MEP Sophie in’t Veld, although she also praised the commission for its attempt to end years of deadlock, adding that “failure is not an option”. The European People’s party - the centre-right group of Von der Leyen - described the plans as “a good starting point”. Governments on both sides of the asylum debate are holding fire as they digest the plans spread over five draft regulations and other official texts Viktor Orbán’s chief spokesperson did not reveal if the Hungarian government was ready to be a “return sponsor” - brokering deals with Middle Eastern and African countries to take back their nationals – in a statement that put more stress in discouraging migrants to leave their homelands in the first place. However one of Orbán’s MEPs, Balázs Hidvéghi, told BBC Radio 4 that “we are ready to take part in what is called return sponsorship”. If true, that could be a significant step. But Orbán’s government is likely to object to the idea that any migrant not returned to their country of origin after eight months would come to live in the EU member state that had taken charge of their return. On the other side of the migration divide, Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, described the plans as an “important step towards a truly EU migration policy”, but cautioned that “assurance on returns and relocation is needed”. Italy could have problems, as the controversial rule that countries of arrival take default responsibility for migrants is largely intact – although there would be more scope for other EU member states to take over. And there are many open questions. The EU executive wants a monitoring mechanism to investigate widely reported illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at Europe’s borders. But that system would be set up by EU member states, namely, the same countries accused of perpetrating violent abuses. Brussels also wants all new arrivals in the EU to undergo health and security screening at the border within five days – an exacting demand on frontline states, such as Italy and Greece with notoriously slow processes, at a time when the EU migration budget has been slashed. Legislators fear the model will simply be creating “more Morias” with people stuck in closed camps in southern Europe. “This pact risks making the model of Greek hotspots a blueprint for all border countries in the EU,” said Erik Marquardt, a German Green MEP, who has been in Lesbos since the Moria fire. These troubling questions and many more are meant to be resolved in nine months: the commission has called on EU ministers and MEPs to agree the legislation by June 2021. If the timing sounds like a tall order, the retreat on refugee quotas may unlock a compromise. But the EU migration debate is unlikely to become “boring” any time soon."
2020-10-24T17:46:27Z,Government reduces minimum salary for migrants to settle in UK,"The government has quietly reduced the £35,800 minimum salary for migrants to settle in the UK by almost 30%, it has emerged. Migrants on salaries of £20,480 but with enough points under Boris Johnson’s new Australian-style immigration system to qualify for jobs where there is a shortage of workers will also be entitled to settle after six years and become citizens. The rules, which come into force on 1 December, were published on Thursday by the Home Office, with the general threshold lowered to £25,600 as the government tacitly acknowledged the essential contribution that lower paid migrant workers make to the UK. Amnesty International UK said it was troubled by the way immigration rules, including salary thresholds, “have long exaggerated the privilege of people already advantaged by their relative wealth, gender and race”. Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “Sadly, this latest development does not appear to signal any new or firm commitment to encourage equality of opportunity through the UK’s immigration system or to respect the rights and human dignity of all women, men and children regardless of class or colour.” However, Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for tighter immigration control, said the move would reduce the incentive for employers to train British workers. The £35,800 salary threshold was introduced in 2011 by Theresa May when she was home secretary as part of the effort to meet targets on restricting net migration set by David Cameron, which the government was never able to achieve. Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, which identified the change in the 507-page rulebook, said it was “the final nail in the coffin of the net migration target”. Deputy director Rob McNeill told the Daily Telegraph: “They are acknowledging that the bluntest of all the instruments the government used to get to that target of tens of thousands has been kicked into touch.” Before the 2019 general election in December, Johnson reprised the core message of Vote Leave’s 2016 EU referendum campaign and said that EU migrants have been able to “treat the UK as if it’s part of their own country” for too long. He guaranteed that migration would fall under his plans after the UK left the EU as he sought to appeal to undecided Eurosceptic voters in Labour marginals. The Home Office did not comment."

The idea that politicians like Boris Johnson and Priti Patel offer “thoughts and prayers” to grieving families while simultaneously limiting routes for asylum is hypocritical and sickening; they have built their political careers by exploiting people’s xenophobia and fear of others.

2020-09-12T16:45:49Z,Greek riot police fire teargas at refugees campaigning to leave Lesbos,"Greek riot police fired teargas at protesting refugees clamouring to leave Lesbos as the situation on the island became more explosive days after devastating fires forced thousands to flee its notorious migrant camp. Tensions mounted as asylum seekers, desperate to make their way to other parts of Europe, watched authorities, including the Greek army, rush to replace the now gutted facility of Moria with a new holding centre. “Freedom, freedom,” demonstrators chanted under the watchful eye of riot police deployed to the Aegean isle from Athens. “We don’t need new camp … we want freedom,” proclaimed some of the crude handwritten placards held aloft by protesters on Saturday. Witnesses reported teargas being fired after younger migrants began lobbing rocks at the police units. A series of overnight blazes starting on Tuesday razed Moria, Europe’s largest refugee camp, decanting close to 13,000 men, women and children into the surrounding countryside. With the exception of 406 lone migrant children who have been flown to the Greek mainland, the former residents have been left to fend for themselves, many making makeshift shelters out of tarps and bamboo reeds along the side of a main road leading to Mytilene, the island’s port capital. Others have camped in fields, olive groves, churches and even cemeteries. Frustration, the insistence of Greek officials that transferal is out of the question and a growing realisation that any prospect of leaving is diminishing fast have helped create an increasingly toxic atmosphere. The destruction of containers housing the asylum service in Moria has further fuelled a prevailing sense of desperation among refugees. “The thought that they may be here for even longer now, the sight of the replacement camp and being stranded without proper shelter for days has, for many, become the tipping point,” said one aid worker requesting anonymity because she was not authorised to speak. Earlier, Greece’s alternate migration minister, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, told SKAI TV Lesbos was facing a public health emergency, “a triple challenge” that also involves “public order and national security”. He expressed “certainty” that the blazes, which erupted in quick succession and appeared to be coordinated, were the result of arson although as yet no one has been arrested and no concrete evidence offered. Suggestions that rightwing vigilantes may be behind the infernos have also been made. The fires broke out within hours of authorities announcing further lockdown measures in the facility after health officials said they had detected dozens of coronavirus cases in Moria. None of those diagnosed with the virus have yet been found, according to Greek officials. On Saturday a woman and her 20-month-old baby were flown to Athens where they will be hospitalised after testing positive for the virus. They were not among the original group, most of whom were described as asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19. With fears of infection rates increasing, some 200,000 Covid-19 rapid tests were flown into Lesbos on a specially chartered plane on Friday. “There are now real fears among our island’s residents of the virus spreading,” local journalist Yannis Sinanis told the Guardian. Officials were working around-the-clock to erect the new settlement, a collection of 500 tents with the capacity to accommodate six people each. Other asylum seekers are expected to be accommodated in a ferryboat and naval ships. The Greek migration minister Notis Mitarachis, coordinating relief efforts on the island, said every refugee would be tested before entering the temporary site. “We believe that within the day we will start taking people in,” he told reporters in televised comments streamlined by the ministry in Athens. “Already the first families are settled here. Food, water, medical supplies, shelter, safety are the priorities of the day.” Greece, like Lesbos, may be on the frontline of migratory flows from war-torn countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa but the refugee problem was an issue that affected the entire continent he said, thanking EU countries for weighing in with aid in the wake of the fires. “We expect from all our European partners to contribute to an issue that is not Greek,” Mitarachis added. “It is European.”"
2020-12-23T07:15:38Z,'Black book' of thousands of illegal migrant pushbacks presented to EU,"A 1,500-page “black book” documenting hundreds of illegal pushbacks against asylum seekers by authorities on Europe’s external borders was released last week and handed over to the EU commission. Compiled by the watchdog organisation Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN), the Black Book of Pushbacks is a collection of 892 group testimonies, detailing the experiences of 12,654 victims of human rights violations along the Balkan migration route, one of the most gruelling in the recent migrant crisis given the alleged violence of border police officers. Every day, thousands of people, mainly from south Asia, the Middle East and north Africa, attempt to cross the Balkans to reach Europe. It is an arduous journey with virtually no welcoming facilities for migrants, who are forced to spend most of the trip in makeshift camps or in train stations. For years, charities have denounced the abuses, particularly in Croatia, as asylum seekers are systematically beaten, robbed and pushed back. Between January and November 2020, the Danish Refugee Council recorded 15,672 pushbacks from Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina, with more than 60% of these reportedly violent. “This book – which brings together four years of work – points to a gaping hole in accountability for perpetrating authorities, including member states and EU agencies, like Frontex,” Simon Campbell, field coordinator for BVMN, told the Guardian. “The testimonies, committed here to paper, represent a definitive archive of evidence, detailing systematic violations against people on the move, such as breaches of international law on asylum and returns, as well as the prohibition of torture.” More than 15 organisations have contributed to the book, which contains maps, data, photos and other key information and was made in collaboration with the United Left block of the European parliament. Last Friday, Malin Björk, a member of the parliament’s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs and Miguel Urbàn, co-founder of Spanish political party Podemos, presented and handed over the Black Book to the EU commissioner for asylum, Ylva Johansson, in Brussels. Speaking about the launch of the Black Book, German MEP Cornelia Ernst said: “We have been so shocked by endless accounts of merciless, sadistic and degrading violence – reminiscent of brutal dictatorships. The Black Book sheds some much-needed light on this dark chapter of the EU. Our hope is that it will contribute to bringing an end to these crimes and holding the governments that are responsible accountable.” “Although these accusations are met with denial from the perpetrating countries, what we provide within these pages is an analysis of patterns and photo evidence that reveal an ongoing, systematic practice,” said Hope Barker, spokesperson for BVMN. “And these are just the stories that the network has managed to record. The reality is much wider and more far-reaching. “We call for an end to impunity and a renewed commitment to accountability, both of which will work towards ending such brutal human rights violations,” she said. In Bosnia-Herzegovina about 1,200 migrants and asylum-seekers are living in squalid conditions in the Lipa tented camp in Una-Sana canton, a site unsuitable for winter. The International Organization for Migration said it would close the camp as Bosnian authorities had ignored its appeals to help supply basic services. Thousands of migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina could soon face an impossible choice: fend for themselves in abandoned buildings and squats, or attempt to cross the border into Croatia and the EU – in the hope of escaping the violence of border police."
2020-10-17T17:54:40Z,Refugee supporters hold 'welcome event' for asylum seekers in Kent,"More than 200 people gathered outside a former military barracks housing asylum seekers near Folkestone, to counter rising far-right activity against migrants. Tensions rose around midday as police stopped a dozen far-right protesters from targeting the event by encircling refugee supporters. After the welcome meeting, around 50 counter-protesters marched, with some brandishing St George’s and union flags and chanting racist messages. “The vast majority of people are supportive of migrants, but we don’t always hear their voice, we hear the voice of a very vocal, significant minority,” said Bridget Chapman, from the Kent Refugee Action Network. The area has seen a rise in violent incidents recently and a small number of residents is said to meet by the site every weekend to harass asylum seekers. “There are groups of far-right vigilantes who are claiming to send back migrant boats,” said Richard, a volunteer with Channel Rescue who preferred not to give his surname. Dozens of asylum seekers have been placed in quarantine in one of the redbrick blocks after one person tested positive for coronavirus. It comes after repeated warnings were given over the cramped and unsanitary conditions at the site. The Guardian understands the man who tested positive, an Iranian asylum seeker, is no longer on site and has been taken to hospital. Kay Marsh, who works for the migrant charity Samphire, believes the deteriorating economy is fuelling anti-immigrant sentiment. “The government has managed to convince populations that there is a foreign enemy: you’ve got no money, no job, that’s because of foreigners. And people believe it because they need someone to blame,” she said. “It’s scary to think that your own government has got it out for you.” Inside the barracks, a group of men waved back at the crowd, clapping and shouting: “Thank you!” On one of the building’s doorsteps, a young man was seen holding up a sign reading “we love you”. Among those supporting asylum seekers was Ross Emans, 43, who came with his son. “This is the first time I’ve been involved with a demonstration to support migrants,” he said, holding a sign that read: “Welcome.” “I used Google to translate “welcome” to Arabic. Hopefully, it’s correct! “The migrants have been demonised and dehumanised on the internet by far-right groups. They are treated as if they are just one. Some people refer to them like they are animals when they are human beings and each of them has their own story. It really concerns me and I can understand why they are leaving their countries.” He added that he was getting a DBS check to be able to volunteer with charity Care for Calais. The charity, based in northern France, tweeted out praise for the supporters. “We are so grateful to everyone who attended the welcome event at Folkestone today to lift the spirits of refugees in the barracks and show them that Britain cares,” they said. “Together we made sure the hundreds of people there know that they ARE welcome in this country.” Amani Arab, a 26-year-old woman who came to the UK as a refugee from Syria, was also at the event. “The Folkestone community is very friendly and welcoming. When I came here I felt that everyone wanted you to be part of this community.” So far only one charity, Migrant Help, has been able to enter the site but other organisations are in talks with the authorities to provide services. • This article was amended on 19 and 26 October 2020 to clarify details about the counter-protests."
2020-09-13T05:09:19Z,The Observer view on the EU's refugee crisis | Observer editorial,"Scenes of devastation and desperation at the burnt-out refugee camp at Moria, on the Greek island of Lesbos, are powerful reminders that Europe’s migrant crisis never really ended. The response of EU member states and close neighbours such as Britain has, with some exceptions, once again been shamefully inadequate. The fact that these failures are familiar does not lessen the immediate, dreadful human impact of this latest tragedy, nor does it obviate the urgent need to find lasting solutions. If fire had not destroyed most of the Moria camp last week, leaving up to 13,000 people without food, water and shelter, it’s a safe bet most of Europe would have continued to turn a blind eye to what was already a scandal on its doorstep. Repeated pleas by local people and the Greek government for more EU support and solidarity would have continued to be ignored. Pictures of small children and bereft families, deprived of all they own, squatting by the roadside or in filthy doorways, have pricked consciences – at least for now. Charities hope the disaster will prove a permanent turning point. “The Moria camp was already unfit for humans before the fire, with four times as many people than it was built for,” said Francesco Rocca, head of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. “Enough is enough. Now is the time to show some humanity and move these people to a healthy, safe and humane place. There are 4,000 children in Moria and no child should have to endure this.” Germany has again taken the lead in offering help, as it did during the 2015 refugee crisis. Plans have been made to transfer 400 unaccompanied minors to 10 European countries, with about 150 going to Germany. The EU commission said about 1,600 people would be given temporary shelter aboard a ferry. After visiting the area, commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas promised a larger, more modern facility would be built at the same location. These are mere stop-gap measures and many locals and migrants oppose replacing the destroyed camp at all. But, as in the past, political obstacles at the national level are preventing a more comprehensive response. Several German regions and cities have offered to take in refugees. In Berlin, about 3,000 people took to the streets last week to demand a more generous attitude. “We have room!” they shouted. Moria was a “camp of shame”. Yet Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, a critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s now-revoked 2015 open-door policy, said the focus should be on providing “help on the ground”. Such caution reflects continuing Europe-wide concern about a resurgence of the anti-immigrant sentiment that has boosted far-right populist and ultra-nationalist groups. It also reflects a divided EU’s repeated failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy based on shared responsibility, though it says new proposals are imminent. Britain’s reaction to Moria is even more deeply unsatisfactory. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has yet to respond to a letter from the Labour peer Lord Dubs urging admission of unaccompanied children. “The government cannot keep dodging the issue,” he wrote. But it seems determined to try. When the Médecins Sans Frontières charity asked Patel in March to accept more children from Moria and other overcrowded Greek camps threatened by Covid-19, she did not deign to reply. Quite how Boris Johnson hopes to establish a leading role for “global Britain” when it ducks its share of responsibility for tackling international migration, one of the great global problems of the day, is hard to fathom. Patel pretends to care about the safety of relatively small numbers of migrants crossing the Channel, over which rightwing bigots and xenophobes have kicked up an enormous fuss. Yet she and other ministers have nothing to say about the catastrophe in Moria and no help to offer. How small minded. How demeaning. How very un-British."
2020-11-24T15:28:08Z,Rescuers recover migrants' wedding rings lost at sea,"On 9 November, a migrant rescue boat came across a red backpack floating in the Mediterranean alongside other remains from a shipwreck that took place weeks before. The rucksack, covered with sea snails and reeking of petrol, contained two wedding rings, inscribed with the names Ahmed and Doudou. “We thought it was proof of yet another love story that ended up at the bottom of the sea,” said Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, who recovered the personal items. “Unfortunately we find many of these. Most of the time suitcases and bags, floating in the sea, are nothing more than symbols of yet another journey that began in Libya and ended in tragedy.” Nevertheless, as it always does, Open Arms activated a procedure to try to trace the owners of the belongings by sharing the photos on their social channels and among their networks of contacts. “What happened next was exciting,” Gatti said. Thanks to an article published in the newspaper La Repubblica that carried photos of the rings, the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) discovered they belonged to a newlywed Algerian couple, Ahmed, 25, and Doudou, 20. The couple, who were staying at a reception centre in Sicily, were among 15 survivors of a shipwreck that took place off the coast of the island of Lampedusa on 21 October in which five people died. “As soon as they showed us the photos of the rings, I couldn’t believe it,” Ahmed said in a message passed on by MSF. ‘‘We had lost everything and now the few things we set out with on the journey have been found. It’s incredible. “The rings were in the backpack because they had broken and we wanted to have them repaired once we arrived in Europe,” Ahmed added. ‘’None of my travel companions managed to recover anything. We are very happy but we are still mourning our friends who didn’t make it.” Ahmed and Doudou told aid workers that they had left Zawiya in Libya on a small wooden boat with 20 other people on 19 October. Forty-eight hours into the crossing, however, their petrol ran out and the boat was left at the mercy of the sea, with weather conditions starting to deteriorate. Ester Russo, a psychologist at MSF who spoke to the couple, said survivors from the shipwreck had told of a big wave that hit about 60km off Lampedusa. “The 15 people onboard were saved by a Sicilian fishing boat,” Russo said. “Five people died, including a two-year-old girl. Her mother was shocked. Time stopped for her when she no longer saw her daughter. On that same trip a nine-year-old child lost his mother and is now alone in Italy.” Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for MSF in Sicily, said Doudou was trying to recover from the trauma of the journey. “She is still in shock from what happened,” Rousan said. “She saw five travel companions die in front of her eyes, including a child. But both she and Ahmed are fine.” The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship. which is off the coast of Sicily. “We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,” said Gatti. “We can’t wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too. It’s not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.”"
2020-09-10T17:29:39Z,Covid-19 fears on Lesbos as thousands of refugees flee huge fires,"Greek authorities on Lesbos are racing to find refugees who had tested positive for Covid-19 before a series of devastating fires forced thousands to flee Europe’s biggest migrant camp. Health officials have rushed 19,000 test kits to the north-eastern Aegean island amid fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. “It’s a very dangerous, very explosive situation,” Efstratios Tzimis, Mytilene’s deputy mayor, told the Guardian. “And it’s making all of us crazed. On the one hand there’s coronavirus, on the other thousands of desperate, hungry people.” Only eight of the more than three dozen refugees diagnosed with the virus have been found. Authorities say they have been quarantined in a special area with close family members. Extra police units were dispatched to the island on Thursday, reinforcing a cordon around Moria, whose charred remains were still smouldering when new fires erupted in and around the facility more than 24 hours after the main blaze began. Men, women and children deprived of shelter slept on the sides of roads, in olive groves and even a graveyard after the fires that began late on Tuesday. Many awoke on Thursday huddled in sheets and blankets that were their only protection against gale-force winds. Hopes of some being able to return to the small section of the hilltop camp that survived the inferno were crushed by a second wave of fire. In the early morning light, former residents could be seen in the apocalyptic landscape desperately foraging for belongings. Less than 48 hours after the first blaze, the notoriously overcrowded facility – home to 13,000 people at the beginning of the week – was reduced to little more than a heap of mangled steel and melted tent tarpaulin. Greek officials, who have declared a state of emergency on Lesbos, say the fires were deliberately started by asylum seekers reacting to quarantine measures after Covid-19 infections were detected. Moria, like other refugee camps in Greece, has been in lockdown since the start of the pandemic in March. The confinement has fuelled anger and hostility among people who, before the pandemic, had been waiting, often for years, for answers to asylum requests. “Some people do not respect the country that is hosting them,” Stelios Petas, a government spokesman, told reporters in Athens. “They believed that if they set fire to Moria, they’d be able to leave the island indiscriminately,” he added, saying only unaccompanied minors would be removed from Lesbos. “We tell them they did not understand. They will not leave because of the fire.” In an EU-funded operation a third chartered plane carrying the last of 406 children hosted at the holding centre flew from Mytilene’s international airport to northern Greece on Thursday morning. From there they are expected to continue their journeys to EU countries that have promised to take them in. Relief efforts have focused on the government and UN refugee agency sending in thousands of tents in addition to a ferryboat and two naval ships to temporarily accommodate people. The centre-right government faces staunch opposition from local residents tired of their island being on the frontline of migratory flows from the war-torn Middle East, Africa and Asia. In the summer of 2015, at the height of Syria’s civil war, close to 1 million refugees crossed the sea from Turkey to Europe via Lesbos. A former army barracks originally designed to host fewer than 3,000 people, Moria was eight times over capacity at the beginning of the year. Human rights groups have criticised the facility, and its dire living conditions, as the wretched face of Europe’s bungled migration policies and inability to humanely manage refugees. Many have called it a stain on the conscience of the continent. On Thursday, as the army cleaned up the wreckage with bulldozers and diggers, infuriated villagers set up roadblocks to prevent them accessing the camp. “‘[The refugees] have to go somewhere else,” said Tzimis, the deputy mayor. “We understand their plight, but people here are also exhausted. Either they are taken to an uninhabited island or, if that can’t happen, Europe should take them in.” Greece’s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, a steadfast supporter of open-air island camps such as Moria being replaced by smaller, “closed” detention centres, called for calm. The prospect of the centres has however been criticised by aid groups and islanders, who fear that the camps will become permanent fixtures. “Everyone has to be realistic,” Mitarachi told Skai TV, saying the government’s priority was to have “no homeless family” by the evening. “At this moment we are up against two fronts. The one is migrants who are resorting to blackmail to leave, the other local leaders who are not displaying the necessary responsibility at such a difficult [time].”"
2020-11-10T16:28:53Z,"Canary Islands appeal for help as 2,200 migrants arrive over weekend","The president of the Canary Islands has appealed for urgent help from the Spanish government and the EU after around 2,200 migrants arrived on the archipelago over the weekend, putting further strain on its already massively overstretched reception resources. Ángel Víctor Torres said the Canaries’ existing infrastructure could not cope with the number of people arriving, as the dangerous Atlantic route from Africa to Europe attracted more refugees and migrants. “It’s not hard to sum up,” Torres said this week. “The flow of arrivals still greatly exceeds the reception capacity. They’re absorbed, they’re distributed and they’re relocated, but the flow of arrivals is still much higher than the reception response.” The regional president pointed out that 2,188 people had reached the islands over the weekend and that they were being housed in makeshift camps on the docks at Arguineguín on Gran Canaria. Torres said the Canaries could not be used as “prison islands” where people were held indefinitely, when there was far more reception space available in mainland Spain. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 11,000 people have arrived in the Canaries by sea so far this year, half of them in October alone, while 414 are feared to have died in the attempt. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018. This year’s figures, however, are well down on 2006, when 32,000 people arrived in the Canaries by sea. Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, and the EU’s commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, visited the islands last week. At a press conference on Friday, Johansson paid tribute to the “tremendous efforts” of the central and regional governments in managing the situation in such difficult times. But Torres asked for help that went beyond words, saying: “We’re not in a planning phase, we’re in a reaction phase.” He said the Covid-19 pandemic was making things ever harder, called for urgent action to dismantle the Arguineguín camp and appealed for the EU to make good on the “shared European commitment” to managing migration. Spain’s interior ministry, meanwhile, has been criticised for refusing to allow journalists to document the plight of those stuck on the Arguineguín docks. Judith Sunderland, Human Rights Watch’s acting deputy director for Europe and central Asia, visited the Canaries over the weekend and described the conditions on the docks as “pretty awful”. She said the Spanish authorities had been slow to act, even after it became clear that the Atlantic route was opening up again. “The numbers surged and all of a sudden, it’s emergency mode and that’s when things get really bad,” she said. “There are two systemic problems, which are the lack of sufficient reception spaces on the islands and then the failure of the central government to systematically, routinely, and in significant numbers, transfer people to the mainland. Those are two very clear solutions.” Sunderland said she had spoken to some women on the docks who had been in the hot, crowded camp for more than two weeks. The longer the migrants and refugees stayed in the area, she said, the worse things would get. “They need to transfer people to the mainland,” she said. “That would alleviate the extreme pressure on the islands right now, which is a recipe for disaster.” Sunderland recognised that Spain, like Italy, had been badly affected by the pandemic, but said it needed to overhaul its “shortsighted and poor” policymaking. “This is a challenge – but it’s not something that Spain can’t handle in a humane way,” she said. “Of course it can; it’s just a lack of will and coordination and a bit of money.” In February, Spain’s migration ministry set up its own management centre in Tenerife with the capacity to accommodate 300-400 people and is about to open another centre. But the secretary of state for migration, Hana Jalloul, said the numbers of people arriving were overwhelming the islands’ reception resources. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, says the Atlantic route is having a resurgence in popularity because of enduring conflicts, land border closures due to coronavirus and increased controls in some north African countries. At least 140 people died last month after a boat carrying 200 people caught fire and capsized off the coast of Senegal in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year."
2020-12-08T00:01:54Z,"End housing of asylum seekers in old army barracks, UK ministers urged","More than 60 community organisations working with migrants held in detention and refugees have urged ministers to consider alternative accommodation to the former army barracks currently being used to house asylum seekers following damning reports on conditions at the sites. Napier barracks in Kent and Penally barracks in Pembrokeshire, which between them hold more than 600 men, were handed over from the Ministry of Defence to the Home Office in September to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers. The Home Office has been hit by a raft of reports alleging poor access to healthcare, denial of access to lawyers, overbearing use of confidentiality agreements and concerns over safety and privacy at the sites. There has been at least one confirmed suicide attempt at one of the barracks. In a letter to the immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, the organisations, led by the Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (Avid), highlight parallels between the barracks and the UK’s system of indefinite immigration detention and calls for community-based alternatives to be sought. Other signatories include Refugee Action, Detention Action, Care4Calais, Migrant Rights Network, Kent Refugee Action Network (Kran), Doctors of the World UK, Choose Love/Help Refugees, Liberty, Jesuit Refugee Service UK and Samphire. Ali McGinley, the director of Avid, said: “There is no shortage of evidence that the UK’s system of immigration detention does very little other than cause long lasting damage: to the individuals held, but also to their families and communities. We’ve seen this first hand over many years. Choosing to ignore this by replicating the worst injustices of this system in the barracks accommodation is irresponsible, dangerous and puts many more people at risk.” The letter to Philp outlines how the isolated locations of the barracks have left residents exposed to abuse by far-right activists, who have been able to easily locate the former MoD sites. The Home Office has said the sites are temporary contingency accommodation for asylum seekers who will eventually be moved to dispersed accommodation such as houses or flats while their claims are considered. It said it intended to use the sites for a year. Official figures showed that in September, 76% of people awaiting a decision on their asylum claim had been waiting for more than six months, up from 58% in September 2019. The letter states there is growing evidence that managing people’s cases while they remain in the community with access to support is both less expensive and more effective. Given the significant backlog in processing asylum applications, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, it is time to consider alternatives, the letter says. Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “We have serious concerns about the mental and physical health of often traumatised people forced to live behind barbed wire and high fences so close to each other in the middle of a pandemic. People need access to medical and legal support that simply cannot be provided in those conditions. “Home Office ministers are failing in their duty of care to people in the asylum system. It must urgently work with providers to find more suitable accommodation in a wider range of areas across the country.” The Home Office has been approached for comment."
2020-11-12T07:15:01Z,Dozens of Sudanese migrants held in Cairo after protests,"Dozens of Sudanese refugees and migrants have been arrested after protests over the murder of a young boy in Cairo. Amnesty International said about 70 people, including children, were arrested by Egyptian security forces after what it said were two peaceful protests on 29 October. Amid reports of rising xenophobia and violence towards refugees in Egypt, the demonstrations were sparked by the stabbing of Sudanese 12 year-old Mohamed Hassan. An Egyptian man has been arrested over the killing. The rights group said security forces dispersed the protests using teargas and water cannon and that some of those arrested were beaten in police custody. The majority of the detainees were released the next day, but 10 men are still being held by the Egyptian intelligence services without access to lawyers. A cousin of one of the detainees said: “We are really concerned about them. We don’t know what’s going to happen for them.” Amnesty said that on 2 November, Egyptian security forces in plainclothes raided the homes and workplaces of at least five Sudanese activists. Others received phone calls, telling them they faced deportion. Several activists have now gone into hiding. The Public Prosecution Office has dismissed claims of human rights violations against foreign nationals in Egypt. According to a source working with refugees in Cairo, many opponents of the Sudanese government – particularly those from Darfur and the Nuba mountains – living in Egypt have been imprisoned, tortured and handed over to the Sudanese security forces by Egypt. According to reports on some Arabic websites, Egypt had in return asked Sudan to deport dozens of Muslim Brotherhood leaders to Cairo. “The Sudanese people who come from African backgrounds such as Nuba, Fur, Zagawa are faced with particular discrimination in Egypt,” said the source. “They are visibly black. While the experience in Egypt of Sudanese who come from Arab backgrounds is relatively better.” Almost 50,000 Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers currently live in Egypt, according to the UN. A woman from Darfur who was detained after a protest, said living conditions in Egypt were tough. “It’s so difficult being a refugee in Egypt. It’s three times harder than what we left behind in Darfur. Yes there were killings and rapes in Sudan, but here is worse. “Egypt looks safe from outside, but it’s so bad from inside,” said the 42-year-old. Of her time in jail she said: “What have we done to deserve all that? They threatened us that we will not see the sun again.” Elena Habersky, a project manager at Refugee Entitlements in Egypt, said the killing of Mohamed Hassan “struck a nerve” with the Sudanese refugee community. “His death was a straw that broke the camel’s back with regard to violence faced by Sudanese refugees … It was only logical that protests would ensue from the community to demand justice for the death of young Mohamed, but to also bring to light the difficulties faced, not only by the Sudanese refugee community, but by many African refugees in general.”"
2020-12-13T08:00:01Z,UK ‘reneges on vow to reunite child refugees with families’,"Unaccompanied children in France are being told by the French authorities that they should give up hope of being reunited with family in the UK after the Home Office failed to offer the help it had promised. With the deadline to enter the UK legally and safely under the EU’s family reunification rules due to expire at the end of the year, the Home Office is accused of reneging on its vow to help unaccompanied children reunite with family in the UK. A year ago, Boris Johnson told parliament that he was “absolutely committed to ensuring that this country will continue to receive unaccompanied children” after Britain left the EU. The Home Office had pledged to reunite families who applied before the 31 December deadline, with charities also saying they received assurances that the UK would continue to reunite families next year for cases accepted before the Brexit transition period ended. However, sources have now revealed that “no proper arrangements” were put in place by the UK for transfers under the family reunification Dublin agreement. Last week, French authorities, following discussions with the country’s interior ministry, began telling children and families that they could not apply to reunite with family in the UK. The move could also affect minors in refugee camps in Greece who are eligible for family reunion, forcing them to risk dangerous journeys in order to reach family in the UK. Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of the charity Safe Passage International, which helps with the transfer of unaccompanied minors to the UK, said: “Unaccompanied child refugees in Europe have been left with nothing more than broken promises and fading hopes of reuniting with family in the UK. It is devastating that children desperate to reunite with their family have been turned away because of government inaction and a failure in international cooperation.” So far, Safe Passage is aware of two families who have been told by French authorities that they could not apply for family reunification, including a Kuwaiti Bidoon woman with three children who is hoping to reunite with her husband in the UK. In addition, the charity knows of 20 cases of unaccompanied children and five families who are eligible to be transferred to the UK but will be refused unless the situation changes. Cases identified in northern France and Paris include 16 unaccompanied children from Afghanistan who are seeking to join family in the UK. One is a child hoping to join his brother, who originally fled the Taliban. In another case an Ethopian husband with two children is hoping to be reunited with his wife. Safe Passage is now urging the UK government to take immediate action to resolve the issue and to cooperate with France and the EU to help reunite families. A Home Office spokesperson said: “These claims are completely inaccurate. We are committed to continuing to process all family reunion cases, under the Dublin regulation, that entered the system before the end of the transition period. All EU member states can continue to make requests to the UK on the basis of family reunion and we will continue to assess and process these requests. “We have to help more people directly from the affected regions and that is exactly what we are planning with our new firm and fair asylum system, which will welcome people through safe and legal routes.”"
2020-10-18T19:41:09Z,Body thought to be asylum seeker found on beach near Calais,"The body of a man thought to be an asylum seeker who may have been attempting to reach the Kent coast has been discovered on a beach just outside Calais, according to French authorities. A dead man, aged between 20 and 40, was reportedly wearing an orange life jacket when he was found on the shores of Sangatte, in northern France, on Sunday morning. Pascal Marconville, a Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor, said the man had “no identity documents on him”, as he ruled out any third-party involvement. It is feared he drowned trying to make the 21-mile crossing of the strait of Dover. Marconville told the regional French paper Voix Du Nord: “The position of the body and the absence of trampling around suggest that his body was thrown back by the sea.” In August, a young Sudanese refugee, later identified as Abdulfatah Hamdallah, was found dead on the same beach after trying to cross the Channel with another boy in an inflatable dinghy with shovels for oars. Campaigners claimed the unsanitary conditions in Calais and alleged abuse by French police officials force many refugees to embark on the dangerous journey in search of a better life. “It’s desperately sad to hear that another refugee has lost his life trying to cross the English Channel. We can only imagine the pain his friends and family must be feeling now and our hearts go out to them. The refugees in Calais form close-knit, supportive communities and this death will hit them all hard,” Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said. “Refugees take this risk because they are frightened, fleeing appalling horrors in some of the most dangerous places on Earth. They do it because of the grim and unsanitary conditions in Calais, where they are constantly harassed and abused by the authorities. They do it because there is no safe and legal way to have their UK asylum claim heard.” More than 6,100 migrants have arrived in the UK on small boats so far this year, with last month the record for migrant Channel crossings. Campaigners and opposition politicians have criticised the government for lacking compassion in dealing with the small-boat crossings and not making it easier for people to legitimately seek asylum in the UK."
2020-11-25T16:27:44Z,Police investigated over alleged violence at Paris migrant camp,"Two police officers are being investigated for alleged violent behaviour during an operation to break up a protest migrant camp in Paris. The public prosecutor’s office announced it had ordered inquiries into two specific complaints against officers dispatched to remove a group of mainly Afghan migrants from Place de la République in the centre of Paris on Monday evening. One investigation concerns an officer filmed apparently deliberately tripping up a man who was running away from the police, causing him to fall badly. The second concerns a police officer filmed holding a journalist on the ground while appearing to threaten him with a truncheon. Rémy Buisine, a reporter with the news website Brut, claimed he was attacked by the same officer “three times” during the evening. Claire Hédon, the independent defender of rights for France, announced she would be looking into the police actions. Several hundred migrants had set up tents in Place de la République after a call by humanitarian organisations; most had been already thrown out of an ad hoc camp on the northern edge of Paris last week and had nowhere to go. The French authorities sent in a squadron of mobile gendarmes as well as officers from the anti-crime brigade and several companies from a “security and intervention unit” to break up the camp. Despite appeals from a number of local councillors, politicians, lawyers and humanitarian organisers, the police set about pulling up tents, tipping their occupants on to the ground, and attempting to disperse the crowds with teargas. Photographs and video images of the operation spread on social media, prompting the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, to say that some of the scenes were “shocking” and unacceptable, and to order an inquiry. However, on Wednesday, Darmanin reiterated his support for the police. “These people were mostly without papers and illegally installed on Place de la République. This clearing [of the camp] was completely legitimate,” he told France 2. “There were unacceptable actions from some police officers … these have to be looked into … those who messed up will be punished.” The prosecutor’s office has asked the police force’s internal disciplinary body to look into the two accusations of “violence by a person with public authority”. The police commissioner, Matthieu Valet, who also represents the union Syndicat Indépendant des Commissaires de Police, told Marianne magazine: “The images are disastrous, but this behaviour doesn’t represent the police.” The row over the operation came as French MPs approved a new law that would prevent media publishing or broadcasting images identifying on-duty police with “deliberate” intent to harm. Article 24 of the Global Security Law was amended to state it would not threaten the “right to inform”. But critics have said it remains a threat to press freedom. Valet accused the humanitarian organisations of “using human misery to obtain shocking pictures”, and said police officers were “subjected to violence every day”. On Tuesday evening, several thousand people gathered in Place de la République to protest against “police violence”. Another demonstration has been called for Saturday. In a separate affair Hédon has called for “disciplinary action” against four police officers accused of seriously injuring Théo Luhaka, a youth worker, when they arrested him in 2017. Hédon said this action should be separate from any legal move. The public prosecutor has called for legal proceedings against three of the four officers for violence against Luhaka, who claims an officer sodomised him with a truncheon during the arrest, leaving him with injuries requiring lifelong medical care."
2020-12-16T18:17:17Z,Home Office criticised over plan to house asylum seekers at Yarl's Wood,"A former immigration removal centre is being expanded to house up to 200 men as they await decisions on asylum claims, it has emerged, triggering accusations of a fresh “hostile environment” policy from the government. The construction of prefab-style accommodation at the privately run Yarl’s Wood centre in Bedfordshire follow a series of damning reports on conditions at two former army barracks sites in Kent and Pembrokeshire being used to hold up to 600 asylum-seeking men. While Yarl’s Wood is not currently being used as an immigration removal centre, the move to construct more accommodation will raise fears of a blurring of the lines between housing for migrants lawfully pursuing an asylum claim and detention of those marked for removal. The government is considering a number of sites for housing asylum seekers across the country, including up to 500 in temporary buildings on Ministry of Defence land next to the small Hampshire village of Barton Stacey. The immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, confirmed in the House of Commons that the accommodation was being built at Yarl’s Wood in answer to a question from the Labour MP for Bedford and Kempston, Mohammad Yasin. Yasin branded the accommodation a “hostile environment” and said he understood it would be ready for its first intake on 24 December. He said: “I’m very concerned that the Home Office is using completely inappropriate accommodation to house asylum seekers who may be suffering severe trauma in environments that appear punitive and hostile. “These camps are being set up at lightning speed in remote areas with zero consultation with stakeholders such as local authorities and the asylum sector. “I am concerned about the conditions asylum seekers will be held in and their access to legal and health services in such a remote location. Though I’m told the residents are free to come and go as they please, this is far from the case.” As a removal centre, Yarl’s Wood was dogged by controversies including hunger strikes, critical inspection reports and allegations of sexual abuse. The Home Office confirmed earlier in the year it was being used to house recent migrant arrivals. The number of small boat arrivals across the Channel has surged to record levels this year, with more than 8,000 migrants and refugees travelling across the Dover Strait, compared with fewer than 2,000 in 2019. However, total asylum applications are down year on year as the Covid-19 pandemic has cut off other methods of travel and limited migration flows. In response, Philp said: “It is not a hostile environment, the accommodation meets the requires standards.” He added: “We are having to provide additional units because the number of people being supported has gone up enormously as a result of coronavirus.” He said the number of cessation notices – the revocation of asylum support – had also dropped, putting pressure on the asylum system, but that these would soon increase again."
2020-10-20T17:49:39Z,Airbus to operate drones searching for migrants crossing the Mediterranean,"Airbus and two Israeli arms companies will be paid €100m (£91m) to operate unmanned drones to spot refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean sea to Europe, according to EU contracts. Drone operations over the Mediterranean will start next year, after testing carried out on the Greek island of Crete. Airbus, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate, will work with state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to operate the medium-altitude long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) – known as drones – for “maritime aerial surveillance services”. As well as the Airbus/IAI contract for €50m, the EU has awarded Elbit Systems, a private Israeli weapons manufacturer, a separate contract worth €50m for identical services. The EU has spent increasing amounts of money on policing its borders after the number of refugees and migrants trying to enter Europe rose in 2015, putting putting pressure on the governments of member states. The political backlash prompted a major increase in spending on measures to police Europe’s southern borders. The budget of the agency responsible, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – also known as Frontex – increased from just €6m in 2005 to €142m in 2015, before surging to €460m this year. The Observer reported last year that Warsaw-based Frontex was preparing to use drones. The revelation prompted criticism that the unmanned aerial vehicles could allow the EU to avoid its legal responsibility to save the lives of people in distress at sea. The drones will be based in either Greece, Italy or Malta. The companies will provide the equipment as well as human operators to control the drones via radio and satellite links. IAI claims its Heron drone is capable of flying for over 24 hours, and can range up to 1,000 miles from its base at altitudes of more than 35,000 feet. It has been used extensively by the Israeli and German armed forces. Airbus said the model is not capable of carrying weapons, and will be painted white with Frontex labelling. Elbit Systems claims its Hermes drones can fly for up to 36 hours at up to 30,000 feet. Last month, Elbit announced that Hermes drones had been tested with the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency off the west coast of Wales for search and rescue operations. Airbus and IAI said they hoped the contract would open the door for the use of drones in other civilian contexts. Moshe Levy, IAI’s general manager of the military aircraft group, said: “Flying in Europe’s civilian airspace is important progress for IAI and a solid proof for the RPAS’s ability to fly in civilian routes. I believe this contract will open the door to more civilian markets.”"
2020-08-28T07:39:16Z,Australia's English language program for migrants set for overhaul amid concerns over its effectiveness,"The federal government’s English program for adult migrants and refugees is set for some major changes amid concerns participants were not leaving with a “functional level” of English. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge announced a host of changes to the billion-dollar Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), including lifting a cap on class hours, and removing the five year time limit on eligibility. This means recent migrants will be able to access English classes for free until they have “functional English”, which the government defines as having the language skills to participate in society. “Without English language skills, migrants are less likely to get a job, less likely to integrate, and less likely to participate in our democracy,” Tudge said. The program, delivered by service providers around the country, currently provides migrants with 510 hours of language tuition for free. But participants are only completing 300 of those hours, according to Tudge, with 21% leaving without “the basic language skills to enable participation in society”. “This is not to blame anyone whose English language proficiency is poor, but clearly full participation in the community is difficult when there are language barriers,” he said. Catherine Scarth, chief executive officer at AMES Australia, welcomed the changes, saying there was a lot of work to do to ensure the changes benefit people looking to learn English. “Five hundred and ten hours isn’t adequate for some people to move from no English at all, to something that’s functional,” Scarth said. “A refugee for instance, coming from a situation with very limited schooling, who might not be literate in their own language, and who might be older, coming to learn English in 510 hours is almost impossible.” The program, as it stands today, provides a structure for service providers to deliver the classes. The structure allows for some flexibility for participants’ situations, with some elements focused on vocational contexts. Scarth said that the government was consulting service providers on the changes, and that it may take years before the changes are enacted. “Whilst I think it is a standout program, one that Australia has provided since post-war migration, it is timely that the minister has taken these actions.” The acting minister said estimates showed close to a million people across Australia lack English language proficiency, impacting potential employment and community cohesion. The changes come as the government faces the challenges to social cohesion from the coronavirus pandemic, with Tudge saying the pandemic had revealed the challenges in communicating with multicultural communities through traditional means. “Whilst we have produced over 4,600 materials translated into 63 languages to accommodate this, the challenge in engaging with all Australians remains,” he said. Tudge also indicated that changes will be made to citizenship tests to include new questions “on Australian values”, but did not elaborate on what those changes would be. “The stronger focus on Australian values in citizenship testing will be an important part of helping protect our social cohesion into the future,” Tudge said. More than 200,000 people became Australian citizens in the 2019-20 financial year – a record. Scarth believes it is high time services provided to new Australians adapted to their needs. “There’s a lot of work to do, to make sure that the changes will benefit people learning English, and there’s a lot that we need to do to make sure that we are providing the flexibility for students to learn and be engaged.”"
2020-12-14T11:14:14Z,Migrant worker at Malaysian medical glove manufacturer dies of Covid-19,"A worker at the biggest global producer of medical rubber gloves has died after contracting Covid-19, in the first known Covid-related death of an employee at the Malaysian company since the virus began to spread through its factories and dormitories. Top Glove’s profits have surged during the pandemic, but the company has faced repeated criticism over its treatment of migrant workers, including claims that it has failed to protect them from the coronavirus. More than 5,400 people have been infected, many of them Top Glove workers, due to outbreaks at the company’s factories, where workers have warned there is little social distancing. On Saturday, a 29-year-old worker, originally from Nepal, died after being diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia with lung fibrosis. He had worked at Top Glove’s manufacturing facility in Klang, 25 miles (40km) west of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, for more than two years. It is not known whether he contracted the virus at work. The company, which makes a quarter of the world’s medical latex gloves, has faced multiple allegations of exploitation from migrant workers. Prior to the pandemic, in 2018, the Guardian revealed allegations that workers at the factories were subject to forced labour and overtime, debt bondage, withheld wages and passport confiscation. As sales of protective equipment soared over the past year, workers said they have toiled for long hours to meet demand. In April, employees told the Guardian they were not being provided with adequate protection, and that they were working 12-hour shifts, six days a week, with some earning as little as £7 a day. Workers, who are mostly from Nepal and Bangladesh, also reported that they were sleeping in 24-person dorms, taking crowded buses to work and that social distancing in factories was not maintained. Top Glove has not yet responded to a request for comment, but has previously rejected claims that workers have been mistreated. Last month the Malaysian government introduced strict movement controls and ordered the staggered closure of Top Glove factories so that workers could be screened and quarantined. The labour department has since said it would file charges against Top Glove over its worker accommodation, which it said was overcrowded and poorly ventilated. US Customs and Border Protection placed an import ban on two of Top Glove’s subsidiaries in July, following allegations of forced labour, but the company has benefitted from huge demand elsewhere. It reported a net profit of $470m for the financial year ending August – up from $90m the previous year. In September, the Guardian found that, despite allegations of worker abuses, medical gloves made by the company had been recently supplied to at least one NHS hospital. Top Glove said in a statement at the time that “employee safety, health and wellbeing have always been of utmost importance” and listed a number of steps it had taken to protect workers during the coronavirus. Andy Hall, a workers’ rights campaigner, said international buyers and government regulators had “turned a blind eye” to concerns to “ensure faster and cheaper delivery of much needed PPE during the pandemic”. The outbreak in Top Glove facilities is another reminder of the vulnerability of migrant workers during the pandemic. Earlier this year, Singapore faced a major outbreak in cramped workers’ dormitories, where people slept on bunk beds with as many as 20 to a room."
2020-09-15T18:07:25Z,The Guardian view on EU migration policy: past time it had one | Editorial,"Despite the searing heat and the absence of a viable alternative, it was reported this week that some former occupants of the burnt-out Moria refugee camp on Lesbos were refusing to move to temporary tented accommodation elsewhere on the island. They fear that if they do so, they will just be forgotten about all over again. Who can blame them? For years the rest of Europe has known of the squalor, overcrowding and desperation at Moria and other detention camps on the Greek islands. The European Union has thrown some money in the direction of Athens and, to a shameful extent, left the Greek government to get on with it. At the end of last year, Greece was hosting around 200,000 migrants, the vast majority of whom had crossed the Aegean Sea from Turkey. Yet during the past five years, a mere 15,000 arrivals have been relocated to other EU countries. As the numbers have grown, the initial generosity of spirit shown by islanders has evaporated. Mainland politicians have become justifiably embittered by the disproportionate burden that Greece, along with Italy and Malta, is being asked to carry. Resentment has bred cynicism. It was clearly hoped, though never publicly stated, that the appalling living conditions endured by migrants, and the interminable wait for their applications to be processed, might discourage others from making the same journey. As arrivals continued this summer, Greece’s conservative government was accused by human rights organisations of illegally and secretly expelling more than 1,000 asylum seekers. A Guardian investigation found similar tactics being used off the Maltese coast. The Moria blaze, and the migrant protests that followed it, must mark the end of this scandalous escalation of hostilities against the vulnerable, and the rest of Europe must recognise its complicity in it. Britain, predictably and shamefully, has sat on its hands since the fire and done nothing. Angela Merkel on Tuesday pledged that Germany would take 1,500 migrants from the Lesbos camp. But more important in the long term is the commitment by Mrs Merkel and the European commission to take a direct role in building and running a dignified reception site for migrants on the island. Most crucially, other member states must be persuaded to take seriously article 80 of the EU treaty, which demands a “fair sharing of responsibility” on migration issues. Next week, the European commission will unveil its long-delayed plan to establish a common asylum and migration policy. Once again, countries will be asked to accept a more equitable distribution of migrants across the union. The European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, has expressed hope that the spirit of the coronavirus recovery fund, which pooled EU debt to help hard-hit nations, can be replicated. But given the implacable opposition of eastern European countries such as Hungary and Poland to a quota system of any kind, it is hard to see how a scheme could work without a mandatory component. Since the peak of 2015, the number of irregular migrants seeking to enter the EU has plummeted. Ms Johansson put it well when she said that Europe does not have a migration crisis right now, but “some migrants are in crisis”. It is past time for something to be done about their predicament."
2020-11-13T16:00:34Z,"Violent extremism linked to failure of migrants to integrate, EU says","The rise of violent extremism in Europe has been linked to the failure of migrants to integrate, in a hard-debated joint declaration by EU governments on the recent terror attacks. The statement by EU home affairs ministers was described by Horst Seehofer, Germany’s interior minister, as a “great sign of solidarity” when delivered on Friday but it had been heavily watered down from a controversial initial draft. After a week of disagreements over the contents of the proposed declaration pushed by France, Austria and Germany, references to Islam were removed along with demands for newcomers to learn the languages of their new home and “earn a living for oneself”. The EU capitals nevertheless highlighted the need to improve social cohesion in Europe as part of its reaction to a spate of terrorist murders in Paris, Dresden, Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Nice and Vienna. “Integration is a two-way street,” the declaration said. “This means that migrants are expected to make an active effort to become integrated, while help in this regard is important.” The statement issued on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in Paris, in the Bataclan theatre and outside the Stade de France offered few new policy initiatives. Talk of sanctions against those who fail to integrate was removed and replaced with a softer warning to NGOs found to be breaking the law. “Organisations that do not act in accordance with relevant legislation and support content that is contrary to fundamental rights and freedoms should not be supported by public funding, neither on national nor on European level,” the statement said. “Also, the undesirable foreign influencing of national civil and religious organisations through non-transparent financing should be limited.” Earlier in the week, Charles Michel, the European council president and a former prime minister of Belgium, had called for the establishment of a European training institute to “train” imams. The statement instead merely said the bloc should “promote that religious education and training – preferably within the EU – is in line with European fundamental rights and values”. The initial draft of the declaration had raised concerns within the governments of the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg about the linking of counter-terrorism with migration and the clear focus on “Islamism”. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, had made the point during a joint press conference with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the chancellors of Germany and Austria, Angela Merkel and Sebastian Kurz, on Wednesday. The declaration was subsequently broadened to reflect concerns about the rise of the far-right, as well as Islamist terrorism."
2020-11-12T19:13:08Z,More than 110 migrants die in Mediterranean in three days,"Four shipwrecks in the space of three days have claimed the lives of more than 110 people in the Mediterranean, including at least 70 people whose bodies have washed up on the beach of al-Khums, in western Libya. According to the UN migration agency (IOM), that boat was reported to be carrying more than 120 people, including women and children. Forty-seven survivors had been brought to shore by the coastguard and fishermen, while the bodies of at least 74 people were floating near the water’s edge on Thursday. A few hours after the bodies were reported, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) helped three women who were the only survivors of another shipwreck, which killed 20 people off the coast of Sorman, in Libya. “Rescued by local fishermen, they were in shock and terrified,” MSF wrote on Twitter. “They saw loved ones disappear beneath the waves, dying in front of their eyes.” Taking advantage of good mid-autumn weather, people smugglers have sent hundreds of migrants to sea in the last week, according to charities. The majority of the journeys have ended in tragedy. On Wednesday, six people died after the dinghy in which they were travelling with more than 100 migrants capsized off Libya’s coast. A six-month-old boy was among the victims. The boy, who had survived the shipwreck, died onboard a rescue boat. Named Joseph and originally from Guinea, he was saved by rescuers from the Spanish non-governmental organisation Open Arms late on Wednesday morning after the dinghy reportedly began to deflate. At least five other asylum seekers died as a result of that incident. “This is a massacre at Europe’s borders,” said a spokesperson for Alarm Phone, a hotline for migrant boats in distress. “What else can we say? We have called for radical changes for years and still the dying continues. It is devastating.’’ Open Arms wrote on Twitter: “Despite the enormous commitment of our medical team, a six-month-old baby has just died. We requested an urgent evacuation for him and other people in serious conditions, but he didn’t make it. How much pain and sorrow!” The dinghy had allegedly left Sabratha, Libya, but began to deflate after a few hours. After a patrol aircraft from the European agency Frontex raised the alarm, the Open Arms ship promptly intervened. “When our rescuers arrived, they found themselves in front of a dramatic scene,” Riccardo Gatti, the president of Open Arms Italy, said. “The boat had practically imploded and hundreds of people found themselves in the water, in the open sea – some were children.” Judging Joseph’s condition to be serious, the rescuers asked the Maltese and Italian authorities to evacuate him for medical treatment. However, when the Italian coastguard arrived, Joseph had already died. “We did all we could to rescue those onboard,” said the medical team of the NGO Italian Emergency, operating onboard the Open Arms. “All this took place just a few kilometres away from an indifferent Europe. Instead of preparing a structured search and rescue system, they instead continue to bury their heads in the sand, pretending not to see the cemetery that the Mediterranean Sea has become.” On Tuesday, another child, whose age is unknown, was among 13 people who died in a separate shipwreck off Libya’s coast. Eleven survivors were taken back to Libya. ‘‘Change is necessary now, more than ever, to guarantee effective rescue at sea and prevent new tragedies,’’ said Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesperson for IOM. In 2020 alone, “over 10,300 migrants have been intercepted at sea and sent back to dangerous Libya”, Di Giacomo said. According to IOM figures, since the beginning of October, at least 30 migrants have died at sea while trying to reach Italy. Since the beginning of 2020, about 575 people have died in the central Mediterranean, but the real number is estimated to be considerably higher, according to IOM. Open Arms is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean. Many other rescue boats are blocked in Italian ports because officials refuse to authorise their departure. “Is the European Union watching?” MSF wrote on Twitter. “Step the search and rescue capacity up, or let us save lives.”"
2020-11-01T19:00:38Z,The Guardian view on Tories and migration: stop the posing | Editorial,"“We don’t see migration as a problem at all: we see people dying at sea as a problem and the existence of the mafias as a problem.” Such was the view expressed last week by Hana Jalloul, secretary of state for migration in Spain. Days earlier, more than 140 people had died off the coast of Senegal, after their ship caught fire and capsized, in the deadliest shipwreck recorded this year. Ms Jalloul spoke of efforts to support the regional government of the Canary Islands, which is struggling to cope with the number of arrivals, and stressed her determination to combat organised crime. She also pointed to migrants’ crucial role in Spanish life, including as care workers during the pandemic. British politicians could profit from studying her example in the aftermath of the drowning of a family of four Kurdish Iranians in the Channel. (A fifth member of the same family, aged 15 months, is missing and presumed dead.) Reports of the deaths of Rasul Iran Nezhad, Shiva Mohammad Panahi and their children drew forth platitudes from the home secretary, Priti Patel, about “thoughts and prayers”. But nothing said by her or Boris Johnson did anything to dispel the impression that their attitude to people trying to reach the UK to seek asylum is chiefly antagonistic. While Ms Patel repeated her opposition to “callous criminals exploiting vulnerable people”, there was no serious attempt to sympathise with the migrants’ desperation – or acknowledge that their reliance on smugglers is a matter not of accident but of political choice. On the contrary, recent weeks have seen Ms Patel adopt extraordinarily hostile language towards lawyers representing migrants, as well as towards smugglers. A week ago, senior judges were among several hundred signatories to a letter complaining that her denunciation of “lefty lawyers” had put people at physical risk. The letter followed reports of a man charged with preparing an act of terrorism after attacking an immigration law firm’s office. It isn’t too late for ministers to change course. The Labour peer Alf Dubs’ amendment to their immigration bill would allow unaccompanied children to be reunited with family in the UK after the transition period ends on 31 December. The UK’s refugee resettlement scheme must also be restarted as soon as the new lockdown ends. It was supposed to provide a safe way in for up to 5,000 of those fleeing persecution, but was suspended due to the pandemic. It is right that those who profit from smuggling people across borders must be tackled. But it is cynical to portray the problem as one created by people smugglers while denying the need for viable options. Collapsing fish populations and the climate crisis are among reasons for increased migration from Senegal and the Sahel region of Africa. The war in Syria and ongoing violence in Iraq continue to force people to flee the Middle East. The victims of these disasters must not be blamed. Responsible politicians would address the causes as well as symptoms. They would also keep a sense of proportion, and enjoin the public to do the same. The number of asylum applications in the UK (35,566 in 2019) is a small fraction of that in France and Germany; Turkey is home to around 4 million refugees. But again and again, the UK government chooses hostile posturing over rational policy based on international cooperation, respect for the law and human rights. Could the deaths of three children lead Ms Patel to give it a rest and listen to European politicians such as Ms Jalloul, or even Lord Dubs? Don’t hold your breath."
2020-10-13T16:35:30Z,Migrant traps could breach maritime treaty | Letter,"It would be interesting to know the substance of the presumed consultations by Dan O’Mahoney, the Home Office’s clandestine Channel threat commander, concerning his piratical proposal to lay the marine equivalent of snares and mantraps in the form of nets designed to foul outboard engines’ propellers (Home Office may use nets to stop migrant boats crossing Channel, 11 October). Presumably he’s taken advice from the International Maritime Organization, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the International Federation of Shipmasters’ Associations, the International Transport Workers’ Federation, Nautilus International, the RNLI, the Royal Yachting Association and Trinity House, to mention just a few of the organisations familiar with the practices of safety of life at sea. I’d be very surprised if there wasn’t a consensus among them that any practice designed to impact on safe navigation would be a flagrant breach of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.

2020-12-17T07:11:20Z,Refugees and asylum seekers moved from Mantra hotel in Melbourne,"Refugees and asylum seekers who had been detained at a Melbourne hotel in Preston for more than a year have been moved to another hotel. About 60 men were transported by bus from the Mantra in Melbourne’s north to the Park Hotel in Carlton about midday amid a heavy police presence. Protesters had gathered outside the Mantra since Monday after the men were told they would be transferred to another location. Several people were arrested after the detainees were driven away from the site. The Park Hotel was formerly known as the Carlton Rydges Hotel on Swanston Street which was previously used as a Covid-19 quarantine hotel for returned travellers. About 30 protesters followed the refugees to the Swanston Street hotel before they were cleared by dozens of police officers. One protester was arrested amid minor scuffles with the police. A refugee, Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, told Guardian Australia about midday the men were yet to receive any further information about their new place of detention. He was hopeful conditions would be better at the new site. But he said later on Twitter that the living conditions at the new hotel were worse than the Mantra. The men have been held at the hotel since being flown to Australia from Manus Island under the now-repealed medevac laws last year. Earlier, witnesses at the Mantra in Preston, said a large number of police had gathered, including mounted officers, as the belongings of some detainees were loaded onto a bus. Alison Battisson, a lawyer who represents some of those who were detained at the Mantra, sharply criticised the move on Thursday. “It’s sad and disappointing that the government continues to ignore the law which requires the release of these gentlemen, not the transfer in militaristic conditions to an undisclosed place of detention,” she said. The men had been hopeful they would be released into the community after five asylum seekers who came to Australia through the medevac legislation were last week granted visas. Those hopes were dashed on Monday when the detainees were told they would be moved. The human rights campaigner and former Socceroos captain Craig Foster said on Thursday the decision to move the men rather than release them meant “uncertainty” and “ongoing trauma”. “This is us, Australia,” he tweeted. “When are we going to stop the ridiculous facade and let these refugees, these humans, go?” A Victoria police spokesperson said: “Police will be in the Preston area to provide security overlay and public order assistance in an operation led by the Australian border force.” A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson said: “Detainees from the Mantra Bell City in Melbourne have now been transferred to a new Alternative Place of Detention (APOD).” “As with all immigration detention sites, robust Covid-19 measures are in place. “Transitory people are encouraged to finalise their medical treatment in Australia so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG, or for those who are not refugees, return to their home country. “In line with Australian government policy, no one under regional processing arrangements will be settled in Australia.”"
2020-11-10T11:22:45Z,Inquiry launched into EU commission's protection of migrants at Croatia border,"An official inquiry has been launched into the European commission’s alleged failure to protect the rights of migrants and refugees said to have been robbed and abused by police at Croatia’s borders. The EU ombudsman is investigating the potential complicity of the EU’s executive branch in the maladministration of funds that should have been spent on supervising the behaviour of border officers working at the scene of some of the violence. There have been multiple allegations of aggressive pushbacks of migrants and refugees by Croatian police on the country’s border with Bosnia, including an incident in which a migrant was shot. Croatia has repeatedly denied allegations of violence by its border patrol and in October said it would launch an investigation with the goal of removing any doubt about police conduct. In June, the Guardian revealed that the commission had withheld from MEPs details of the Croatian government’s failure to spend EU money committed to the supervision the police officers on the border. One European commission official privately warned that disclosure of the underspend “will for sure be seen as a ‘scandal’”. The revelation highlighted the Croatian government’s human rights record and the apparent willingness of the EU’s executive branch to cover for Zagreb’s failure. Croatia is seeking to enter the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone – a move that requires compliance with European human rights standards. The ombudsman’s inquiry has been launched in response to a complaint by Amnesty International whose European institutions director Eve Geddie said: “Over the years, Amnesty and other organisations have documented numerous violations, including beatings and torture of migrants and asylum-seekers by Croatian police, whose salaries may have been paid for by EU funds. “Today’s announcement of an inquiry by the EU ombudsman into how the commission allowed the funds to continue to be used without ensuring compliance with human rights is a significant first step towards addressing these flagrant abuses and providing accountability. “By continuing to fund border operations and giving a green light for Croatia’s accession to the Schengen area, the commission abdicated its responsibilities to monitor how EU assistance is used and sent a dangerous signal that blatant human rights violations can continue with no questions asked.” The establishment of supervisory mechanisms to ensure the humane treatment of migrants at the border had been a condition of a €6.8m (£6.1m) cash injection announced in December 2018 to strengthen Croatia’s borders with non-EU countries. The mechanism was publicised by the European commission as a way to “ensure that all measures applied at the EU external borders are proportionate and are in full compliance with fundamental rights and EU asylum laws”. Croatian ministers claimed last year that the funds had been handed over to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Croatian Law Centre to establish the supervisory mechanism. But both organisations subsequently denied receiving the money. In January this year, the commission was asked by Clare Daly, an Irish MEP in the Independents 4 Change party, to account for the discrepancy. A commission official responded that the UNHCR and Croatian Law Centre had established the monitoring mechanism but from “their own funds” to ensure independence from the government. He added: “Hopefully [this] clarifies this matter once and for all”. But both organisations denied being involved in any monitoring project, clarifying that they had only been engaged in an earlier initiative involving the examination of police files. Beyond the apparent inaccuracy of the response to Daly, internal emails suggest the full facts of the “underspending” – as its known to the commission – were also withheld from MEPs. The European commission failed to inform Daly that the Croatian government had decided to ringfence only €102,000 of the €300,000 provided for the monitoring mechanism and that ultimately only €84,672 was actually spent: €17,469.87 was given to the interior ministry and €59,637.91 went to NGOs. A roundtable conference accounted for €1,703.16. “While we know that there has been underspending on the €300,000 … we thought that around €240,000 were nevertheless spent in the context of the monitoring mechanism,” an EU official wrote while discussing how to deal with the MEP’s questions. “Having spent only €102,000, will for sure be seen as a ‘scandal’.” In response to questions by this newspaper at the time, a spokesman for the commission said they had not provided the full information to MEPs as they had an “incomplete” account."
2020-12-10T12:39:34Z,Councils vow to defy UK rule on deporting migrant rough sleepers,"A growing number of councils, charities and other organisations have pledged to boycott new Home Office rules to criminalise and deport migrant rough sleepers. The Home Office changed the UK immigration rules on 1 December, although it has not yet published guidance about how to apply them. Local authorities, MPs, anti-trafficking organisations and homeless organisations including Crisis and St Mungo’s are warning that the rules, which could withhold leave to remain from migrants found to be rough sleeping or revoke it from those who have it, will punish and criminalise some of the most vulnerable. The majority of the UK’s migrant rough sleepers are in London, with about half of those rough sleeping in the capital thought to be migrants. The Greater London Authority is refusing to cooperate with the Home Office and has stated: “The GLA and its commissioned services will not collaborate with such draconian measures.” Haringey council has said it will not collaborate with the Home Office on the new policy, and Islington council has said the same, warning that this kind of cooperation with the Home Office will compromise relationships of trust with vulnerable rough sleepers. Southwark council has also voiced concerns. Public Interest Law Centre is bringing a legal challenge against the rules. It warns that the policy will create a “chilling effect” on migrant rough sleepers’ willingness to approach services for support and so could increase rough sleeping. It says the new rules are so general that migrants who are office workers found sleeping at their desk late at night or travellers sleeping at an airport before catching an early morning flight could find themselves caught up inthem. The centre previously brought a successful legal challenge against a government policy to deport EU rough sleepers in December 2017. The Labour MP Apsana Begum described the policy change as “despicable” and called for it to be scrapped. She said: “It effectively criminalises rough sleepers who were not born in the UK and adds to the draconian rules already facing those who are seeking asylum or permission to remain.” Benjamin Morgan, who runs a rights project for homeless migrants at the Public Interest Law Centre, said: “We’re heartened that opposition is mounting to these changes to the immigration rules, which effectively criminalise rough sleeping among non-UK nationals. We believe these changes are unlawful.” The chief executive of St Mungo’s, Steve Douglas, said: “It is disappointing that this proposed change in approach has not been discussed with the homelessness sector, where there is real concern that it will increase distrust of the Home Office’s intentions and could drive people with a legitimate right to remain away from essential services.” One 38-year-old migrant rough sleeper from east Africa, who has been street homeless for three years, said he feared being rounded up and detained as a result of the new rules. “I’m not allowed to travel, to work or to claim benefits. What are we expected to do? The government is making decisions for us. My life is no longer my own.” A government spokesperson said: “For the small minority of migrant rough sleepers who continue to refuse government and local authority support and repeatedly engage in persistent antisocial behaviour, the new immigration reforms mean they could lose their right to be in the UK. “This would be a last-resort measure, and initially individuals would be asked to leave voluntarily with government support. In the event that they refuse, we may take the step to remove them.”"
2020-08-16T06:30:04Z,Inventing a 'migrant invasion' is part of a toxic rhetorical ploy  | Kenan Malik,"It’s a title of which Captain Mainwaring would have been proud: “Clandestine Channel Threat Commander”. The man responsible for saving Britain from the threat of a migrant invasion. If you invent an invasion, you clearly need also to invent a fantasy job title to repel it. There is nothing new in undocumented migrants crossing the Channel. Last year, about 2,000 people did so, without it causing national panic. This year, the figures have jumped to about 4,000 so far, in large part because the pandemic has meant fewer lorries travelling to and from France. Many claim that their objection is not to the migrants themselves but to the “unfairness” of their “queue-jumping”. There is, though, barely a queue to jump. As Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister and author of Welcome to Britain: Fixing Our Broken Immigration System, put it: “There is currently no lawful way to reach the UK on refugee or humanitarian grounds.” It is, he suggested, “logical to argue ‘no to refugees!’ but not ‘join the queue, refugees!’”. Others argue that undocumented migrants are a challenge to British sovereignty. If a few thousand people without proper papers pose an unbearable assault on national sovereignty, it suggests that the problem lies in our understanding of sovereignty, not with the migrants. In any case, even with this year’s rise, the numbers crossing the Channel are tiny compared with the total number of undocumented migrants in Britain, which is probably between 600,000 and 1.2 million. Few have smuggled themselves in, but the status of many has changed thanks to the byzantine character of British immigration law. A recent National Audit Office report observed that the Home Office has no idea what the real figure is (the guesstimates are from independent organisations), nor shows any inclination to find out. The government, in other words, is not particularly bothered by the issue of unauthorised migrants, nor sees it as a serious threat to sovereignty. It just wants to be seen to be doing something about it. The difficulty in thinking through issues about immigration is that it has become symbolic of wider social concerns. On the one side, “uncontrolled” immigration has become emblematic of a world in turmoil, over which we have little control. The images of people crammed into flimsy boats crossing the Channel inevitably feed into a deeper set of anxieties. On the other side, those supportive of migrants often dismiss such anxieties or fears as racist, bigoted or ignorant, a view that has been turbocharged since the Brexit vote. A YouGov poll shows Britain divided over attitudes to cross-Channel migrants, 49% having no or little sympathy and 44% having a “great deal” or a “fair amount”. Among Leavers, fewer than a quarter had sympathy, compared with two-thirds of Remainers. Immigration, like many other issues, has been folded into the culture war. Last week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, reportedly told Tory MPs that she would refashion asylum rules in a way that would make “the left… have a meltdown”. When policy is driven as much by the tribal demands of the culture war as by the needs of migrants or of Britons, then it is itself in meltdown. Patel also claimed that the asylum system is broken because it allows “leftie Labour-supporting lawyers… [to send] us legal letters every day to try to stop us removing people from this country”. People such as Paulette Wilson, one of the Windrush generation, whose deportation was stayed only by the last-minute intervention of lawyers. After Wilson’s death last month, Patel paid tribute to her as someone who had “dedicated her last years to highlight the terrible injustices faced by the #Windrush generation”. In fact, had Patel had her way, the pesky lawyers would not have been able to prevent Wilson spending her last years exiled in Jamaica. Rightwing politicians and commentators often denounce “identity politics” as divisive while pursuing divisive, tribal policies themselves. Too many on the left, though, fail to recognise that pursuing the culture war is divisive, undermining the kinds of social coalitions necessary to bring about social change. Writing in the context of racism and police brutality in the US, the historians Adam Rothman and Barbara J Fields observed the need “to convince white Americans that what is good for black people is also good for them”. Much the same is true in the migration debate in Britain. So long as we pit the interests of “queue-jumping” migrants against those of the “racist” working class, we will be able to defend the interests of neither. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
2020-12-18T12:00:08Z,What did Santa bring us? Two Syrian refugees,"We were halfway through the annual game of pass-the-orange-under-the-chin when I realised that Christmas was going to be OK. No, not just OK, better. My Dundonian mother is pretty competitive when it comes to our traditional Christmas games – no one flips a kipper further or faster. Yet there she was, standing between Mohammed and Ayman and taking significantly longer than usual to retrieve the orange from beneath the chin of one of our Syrian guests before passing it securely to the next. “Are you all right there, Ma?” “I’m fine, thank you. You worry about your own team.” My team managed to transport the orange up and down our line of 12 people without the use of hands and won. My mother didn’t seem that bothered. The gathering of clans for our family Christmas is never a small affair. Health and travel arrangements allowing, we usually number 20-plus Haningtons and Scotts, plus in-laws. In 2017 our numbers were swollen still further, thanks to the addition of Mohammed and Ayman and a couple of their friends. I had been anxious about Christmas. We are not a particularly religious family, but certain things are non-negotiable. We always have to watch the four Christmas classics: Scrooged; It’s a Wonderful Life; The Grinch; and Home Alone 2. We all write a letter to Father Christmas, regardless of whether or not we believe in him. And we all go to midnight mass and sing our lungs out, regardless of … see previous. I worried about whether our guests, both of whom are Muslim, would fit in. I worried about whether they would want to. We had been hosting refugees like Mohammed and Ayman for just shy of a year. We decided to do it because it was something we could do. We live in a big house in a part of London with a park and woodlands, pubs and a decent high street. In short, we are very lucky, and once it became clear that both our children were heading to Glasgow for study and work, it seemed like time to share some of that good luck with people who had enjoyed very little. My wife took the lead, contacting Refugees at Home, a charity that essentially provides a matchmaking service, connecting refugees who need temporary accommodation with families or individuals who are willing to host them. The minimum requirement is that you can offer a room in your house and a shelf in the fridge where your guest can store their food. In practice, of course, you end up sharing much more than that. The proof of that came in many forms that Christmas, including a pudding-shaped starter made entirely of rice-stuffed vine leaves. Usually, everyone takes responsibility for bringing some of the food for our annual get-together. Snacks, starters, multiple main courses, cheeses, booze, puddings and indigestion tablets – everyone brings something. This year, Mohammed and Ayman suggested we do it differently. If we all donated a few quid, they would ask their friend Mo Rahimeh, the man behind a pop-up restaurant called Mo’s Eggs, to help them give the whole occasion a Syrian flavour. Mo can make an egg taste better than any egg has a right to taste, but with Ayman and Mohammed’s help he went further. Freshly baked flatbread with homemade hummus and a smoky baba ganoush. Syrian rice with roast chicken, eggs cooked in half a dozen different ways including the “jungle eggs” that he had created when he was in the camp outside Calais. Plus, of course, the stuffed vine-leaf creation, which looked more like an artwork than an entrée. Bread was broken and stories were told. The young Syrians talked openly to interested family members about the ordeals they had gone through in order to reach the UK. I had spoken to them, and to other refugees we had met, about their journeys across Africa and Europe as part of the research for a book I was writing and had come to realise that, if anything, we underestimate the horror. In between the stories, everyone took turns on Spotify, and the result was an interesting mash-up of Motown, Fairouz, Slade, Sabah Fakhri and Bob Dylan’s Christmas album. The day and night-long celebration culminated with some more games, guitars and harmonica and jokes, some of which were easier to translate than others. Someone read an extract from Dickens’ Christmas Carol, someone else read some Dylan Thomas. Finally, Ayman stood and recited The Damascene Poem by Nizar Qabbani. He spoke in Arabic and then in English. “I am a Damascene If you dissect me into halves You will have but grapes and apples Falling in your path.” It was a hard act to follow and, wisely, no one tried. Better to sit and acknowledge the many gifts these young guys from Damascus had brought us.

2020-12-07T07:00:32Z,'Game-changer': £1m pledged to help refugees resettle in UK,"A US-based foundation has pledged £1m to help encourage communities across the UK to resettle hundreds more refugee families. The money from The Shapiro Foundation will be used to support the community sponsorship scheme, which enables grassroots groups to offer a home to refugees who are in greatest need, including survivors of violence and torture, and people requiring urgent medical treatment. Since its launch in 2016, community sponsorship groups have resettled 449 refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. One of the triumphs of community sponsorship has been its success in offering families sanctuary in parts of the UK not previously regarded as obvious places for refugees to resettle such as remote rural areas. The Covid crisis has caused UK resettlement schemes to stall but the hope is that the Shapiro Foundation funds will help give the grassroots movement new impetus. The Rev Canon Karen Rooms, the chair of trustees of Citizens UK, whose Sponsor Refugees arm helps communities set up local schemes, described the Shapiro fund as a “game-changer”. She said: “It will enable us, and other charities, to take the number of local community sponsorship groups we support to another level, safe in the knowledge that there is financial support available should a serious problem arise.” The fund was launched on Sunday night by Ed Shapiro, managing trustee of The Shapiro Foundation, at an event organised by Citizens UK called the Refugees Still Welcome Assembly. The gathering of 500 community leaders from across the UK celebrated the partnership between civil society, national government and local councils that resettled 20,000 refugees since 2015. In response to the Syrian crisis, the UK government launched the vulnerable persons relocation scheme for Syrian nationals, aiming to bring in 20,000 refugees by 2020. By October, more than 19,750 people had been brought in. At the time of the launch of the government scheme, groups such as Citizens UK campaigned for local groups to play a bigger role in resettling refugees and the community sponsorship was created. Citizens UK has called on the UK government to build on the vulnerable persons scheme by resettling a further 25,000 refugees by 2025. The new UK community sponsorship backstop fund could enable 200 new local groups to resettle approximately 1,000 additional refugees in the UK. Ed Shapiro said: “My family has been directly involved in sponsoring Syrian refugees in our own community, Boston, for the past four years and can testify to the difference it makes – not just transforming the lives of a Syrian family, but transforming the community too. “We have been inspired by the humanity of hundreds of people in neighbourhoods across Britain who have already sponsored a refugee family, and now we want to see hundreds more take up the community sponsorship challenge in the years to come. We are also hopeful that the UK will serve as a model for the global expansion of community sponsorship, including the US in 2021.” The backstop fund will reduce the financial exposure of lead sponsor charities in the event that a local community sponsorship group being unable to fulfil its resettlement plan for the refugee family they have welcomed. This will allow lead sponsors such as Citizens UK support a further 200 community sponsorship applications with substantial resources available as a last resort if a local group runs into difficulties."
2020-12-10T19:27:22Z,UK to deny asylum to refugees passing through 'safe' third country,"Ministers have quietly changed immigration rules to prevent people fleeing war or persecution from claiming asylum in the UK if they have passed through a “safe” third country, prompting accusations of a breach of international law. From 1 January, claims of asylum from a person who has travelled through or has a connection to a safe third country, including people coming from EU member states, will be treated as inadmissible. The changes will also prevent asylum seekers from being able to make a claim in the territorial waters of the UK. The UK government will be able to remove refused asylum seekers not only to the third countries through which they have travelled, but to any safe third country that may agree to receive them, an explanatory memo states. A 10-page statement outlining the changes to the rules was published online without a press or public announcement. However, the changes highlight a significant hurdle for the UK government: claims will only be treated as inadmissible if the asylum applicant is accepted for readmission by the third country through which they have travelled or another safe state agrees to take them. Immigration law experts have said this could render the new policy “pointless” and would most likely delay asylum applications and leave refugees in limbo in the UK. Colin Yeo, a leading immigration barrister with expertise in asylum law, wrote on Twitter: “The policy is pointless because the govt has negotiated no such return agreements, so all it does is delay decisions on all claims, which is cruel to genuine refugees, and delay removal of non genuine cases.” The Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said the changes were “yet another breach of international law”. He said: “The UK has a proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need, but now the Conservative government is turning its back on refugees. This latest nasty policy from [the home secretary] Priti Patel goes against our commitments under the refugee convention and against everything the UK stands for. It’s yet another breach of international law by this irresponsible tory government.” Beth Gardiner-Smith, the chief executive of Safe Passage International, a charity that help refugees access safe and legal routes to asylum, said: “The government’s changes to the immigration rules are a direct assault on the fundamental human right to asylum. These chilling changes on International Human Rights Day do a disservice to the UK’s proud record of providing safety to those fleeing persecution and violence.” The number of small boat arrivals across the Channel has surged to record levels this year, with more than 8,000 migrants and refugees travelling across the Dover Strait, compared with less than 2,000 in 2019. However, total asylum applications are down year on year as the Covid-19 pandemic has cut off other methods of travel and limited migration flows. Patel has been accused of responding haphazardly with kneejerk proposals ranging from sending asylum seekers thousands of miles away to islands in the South Atlantic, to using giant water cannons to repel boats. The prime minister has reportedly become frustrated with Patel’s handling of the situation. The UK is a party to the UN’s 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and to its 1967 protocol, a piece of international law designed to protect refugees. The Home Office provided a statement through the immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp. He said: “We are determined to fix the broken asylum system to make it firm on those who come here through illegally facilitated routes and fair on those who play by the rules. There is no reason to leave a safe country like France to make a dangerous crossing. These measures send a clear message and are just one of the steps the government is taking to tackle the unacceptable rise in small boat crossings.”"
2020-10-28T12:53:07Z,EU accused of abandoning migrants to the sea with shift to drone surveillance,"The EU has been accused of condemning migrants to death by critics of its recent €100m (£90m) deals for drone surveillance over the Mediterranean Sea. Campaigners and MEPs have accused the EU’s border agency Frontex of investing in technology to monitor migrants from afar and skirt its responsibilities towards people in distress. Frontex is already under fire after an investigation last week accused it of complicity in often dangerous pushbacks aimed at preventing asylum seekers crossing the Aegean Sea. The agency has denied knowledge of, or involvement in, pushbacks. On Tuesday it launched an internal inquiry, pushed for by EU commissioner Ylva Johansson after reports in the Guardian, but said it had yet to find any evidence of violations. Wim Zwijnenburg, who works on disarmament for the Dutch peace organisation Pax, said EU policymakers had developed a “technology fetish” about watching its borders. “Are they putting the same amount of money into responding?” he said. “Are we going to now have more cameras in the sky to watch people drown in the Mediterranean? “We have all these eyes in the sky, but we don’t have hands on the sea.” Earlier this month Frontex awarded contracts to Airbus and Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems for military-grade drones to monitor “every sea craft involved in any form of irregular or illegal activities at sea”. The EU has said air surveillance helps save lives. But in June a group of migrant rescue NGOs released a report claiming Europe’s air operations had led to tens of thousands of people being taken into custody by the Libyan coastguard, while the EU ended its own sea patrols. “European actors are trying to withdraw their presence in the sea and, we would argue, to not abide by their duties,” said Kiri Santer, from Alarm Phone, one of the NGOs behind the report. “They continue to be present but from the air, so they can be aware of different migrant boats leaving from the Libyan shores and feed that information to the Libyan coastguard,” she said. The new drone operations, expected to launch next year, will allow Frontex to view almost real-time surveillance from bases between Greece, Italy and Malta. Oliver Nuffer, sales head for Airbus’s defence wing, said Frontex was its first nonmilitary client. The firm will be operating the Israeli Heron 1 aircraft, equipped with infrared cameras and maritime radars. “In spring, potentially the refugees are crossing again the Mediterranean Sea and Frontex would like to have a closer look at this kind of situation. But in general it is maritime surveillance,” he said. Airbus hoped the contract would lead to more civilian partnerships. Although the technology has been developed for the military, the unarmed drones provide daylong flights that would change how Frontex is able to monitor the sea, said Nuffer. Elbit will also operate drones. It has previously used the Hermes 900 in tests for the EU. Both types of drones have been deployed in combat situations, mostly in Gaza, but will be unarmed. German MEP Özlem Demirel, who has repeatedly questioned the EU commission since the tender was issued a year ago, said it was “scandalous” to be equipping Europe’s border forces with the technology. “The EU’s external border is increasingly militarised, because surveillance drones are primarily military technology,” she said. Demirel also criticised the EU’s partnership with the Libyan coastguard, which it has funded and trained, despite criticism of its connection to militias and accusations of involvement in trafficking. Frontex’s budget increased to €460m this year, up from €333m last year and €142m in 2015, as Europe focuses more on policing its borders. It issued tenders last year for mobile surveillance systems with infrared cameras and radars that could be mounted on pickup vehicles and vans to detect cross-border movement."
2020-11-26T07:30:51Z,Qatar firms’ failure to pay leaves migrant workers destitute – report,"Companies in Qatar have failed to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars” in salaries and other benefits to low-wage workers since the coronavirus outbreak, according to new research by the human rights group Equidem. In its report, Equidem describes how thousands of workers have been dismissed without notice, put on reduced wages or unpaid leave, denied outstanding salary and end of service payments, or forced to pay for their own flights home. The report’s findings appear to amount to “wage theft” on an unprecedented scale, leaving “worker after worker” destitute, short of food and unable to send money home during the pandemic, in one of the richest countries in the world. “I came here to work for my family, not to be a beggar living on my own,” said a cleaner from Bangladesh, who said he had not received his salary for four months. In separate research, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre found that unpaid or delayed wages were cited by workers in 87% of cases of alleged labour abuse affecting almost 12,000 workers since 2016. Around 2 million migrant workers – mostly from south Asia – work in Qatar, many on construction projects related to the 2022 World Cup. Equidem praises some measures put in place by the Qatar government during the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the government made it mandatory for companies to continue to pay workers in quarantine or government-imposed isolation, and set up a £625m loan scheme to help companies do so, but the report warns of “widespread failure to comply” with this and other regulations. The government later permitted companies that had stopped operating due to Covid restrictions to put workers on unpaid leave or terminate their contracts as long as they complied with requirements of the labour law, including giving a notice period and paying outstanding benefits. The report highlights a number of companies that exploited or ignored this directive. Up to 2,000 workers employed by one construction company were laid off on the spot, workers claim. Most did not receive their outstanding salary or end of service settlement, a payment equivalent to three weeks’ salary for each full year of work. “Many migrant workers are in an extremely vulnerable position with no real ability to assert their rights or seek remedy for violations,” says the report. Mustafa Qadri, the director of Equidem, said the lack of a lawful right to organise or join a trade union has been particularly damaging. “It has prevented workers from having a seat at the table with government and employers to negotiate an equitable share of funds,” he said. The report describes similar findings in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as policies in response to the pandemic which amount to racial discrimination. In both countries, the authorities required private companies to continue to provide wages and benefits to nationals, but allowed them to reduce wages or stop paying non-nationals. In a statement, the Qatar government said its response to the pandemic, “has been driven by the highest international standards of public health policy and the protection of human rights”. The government has provided free testing and treatment and said, “employers failing to pay their staff on time or withholding end of service payments have faced disciplinary action, including heavy fines and bans that prevent them from operating”."
2021-01-01T07:15:03Z,Tributes paid to Ethiopian refugee farmer who championed integration in Italy,"Tributes have been paid to a 42-year-old Ethiopian refugee and farmer who became a symbol of integration in Italy, her adopted home. Agitu Ideo Gudeta was attacked and killed, allegedly by a former employee, on her farm in Trentino on Wednesday. Gudeta had left Addis Ababa in 2010 after angering the authorities by taking part in protests against “land grabbing”. Once in Italy, she tenaciously followed and realised her ambition to move to the mountains and start her own farm. Taking advantage of permits that give farmers access to abandoned public land in depopulated areas, she reclaimed 11 hectares (27 acres) around an old barn in the Mòcheni valley, where she founded her La Capra Felice (The Happy Goat) enterprise. Gudeta started with a herd of 15 goats, quickly rising to 180 in a few years, producing organic milk and cheese using environmentally friendly methods and hiring migrants and refugees. “I created my space and made myself known, there was no resistance to me,” she told Reuters news agency that year. “Agitu brought to Italy the dream she was unable to realise in Ethiopia, in part because of land grabbing,” Gabriella Ghermandi, singer, performer, novelist and friend of Gudeta, told the Guardian. “Her farm was successful because she applied what she had learned from her grandparents in the countryside. “In Italy, many people have described her enterprise as a model of integration. But Agitu’s dream was to create an environmentally sustainable farm that was more than just a business; for her it also symbolised struggle against class divisions and the conviction that living in harmony with nature was possible. And above all she carried out her work with love. She had given a name to each one of her goats.” In a climate where hostility toward migrants was increasing, led by far-right political leaders, her success story was reported by numerous media outlets as an example of how integration can benefit communities. “The most rewarding satisfaction is when people tell me how much they love my cheeses because they’re good and taste different,” she said in an interview with Internazionale in 2017. “It compensates for all the hard work and the prejudices I’ve had to overcome as a woman and an immigrant.” Two years ago she received death threats and was the target of racist attacks, which she reported to police, recounting them on her social media posts. But police said a man who has confessed to the rape and murder of the farmer was an ex-employee who, they said, allegedly acted for “economic reasons”. The UN refugee agency said it was “pained” by Gudeta’s death, and that her entrepreneurial spirit “demonstrated how refugees can contribute to the societies that host them”. “Despite her tragic end, the UNHCR hopes that Agitu Ideo Gudeta will be remembered and celebrated as a model of success and integration and inspire refugees that struggle to rebuild their lives,” the agency said. “We spoke on the phone last week’’, said Ghermandi. “We spent two hours speaking about Ethiopia.

2020-09-28T06:00:05Z,"Create safe, legal routes for refugee families to reunite in UK, stars urge PM","Some of Britain’s biggest cultural stars, including Olivia Colman, Michaela Coel and Stephen Fry, are calling on the government to establish safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to reach the UK. More than 70 high-profile actors, musicians, comedians, artists and sports players have sent a letter, seen by the Guardian, to the prime minister demanding a change to the UK’s restrictive refugee family reunion laws. Current rules only allow adult refugees to apply for their spouses or children under 18 to join them; children recognised as refugees in the UK can not apply for their parents or siblings aged over 18 to accompany them. Patrick Stewart, Chiwetel Ejiofor, the band Coldplay, Jessie Ware and Gary Lineker are also among the 70-plus celebrities to back the Families Together coalition, which includes among others Amnesty International UK, British Red Cross, Refugee Council and the UN Refugee Agency, in calling for a relaxation of this rule. The coalition has launched a new petition on the issue. Lineker told the Guardian: “There are children in the UK right now who have fled war and persecution and have no hope of seeing their parents or siblings again. We should be offering them support and compassion. A simple change to the rules could be transformational.” Helen Mirren, Joanna Lumley, Adrian Lester, Kate Moss, Riz Ahmed and Nish Kumar are among the other signatories to the letter. It reads: “For some children in the UK, being kept apart from the parents they so desperately need is an everyday reality – pandemic or not. “These children are vulnerable. They have been recognised as refugees by our government, having fled war or persecution – dangers and horrors most of us will never be able to imagine. “But the UK’s current refugee family reunion rules say that these vulnerable child refugees cannot be reunited with their family members.” The action comes at a time of increased tension over the UK’s asylum policy. Nearly 7,000 migrants have arrived in the UK in small boats across the Channel so far this year, more than three times the number of arrivals in the whole of 2019. Humanitarian groups and migration experts have been calling for safe and legal routes to be established to reduce the number of people risking their lives at sea to reach the UK. The government could consider strengthening existing family reunion rules, provide places for child refugees under the so-called Dubs scheme, or develop humanitarian visas that would give people advance permission to enter the UK to claim asylum. But the government is persisting with a hardline approach to the arrivals in an attempt to make the route across the Channel “unviable”. Over the summer, RAF aircraft were launched over the Dover Strait to assist Border Force, which Labour said was an attempt to “militarise a response to a humanitarian crisis”. Merhawi Hagos, 18, a refugee from Eritrea, said: “I was separated from my mother when I was 14 years old. I had an extremely difficult asylum journey to come to the UK and thankfully I was granted refugee status two years ago. “But I found the experience of living without a family to be unbearable and a situation I would not wish upon anyone. I struggle to lead a normal life: cannot plan, cannot focus on my studies or work. I feel lonely, and depressed and do not sleep well. “My family are in a refugee camp in Ethiopia. The camp is not secure and safe. I’m imploring the UK government to change the family reunion rules so that young refugees like myself can be together with their families in the UK.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Government provides a safe and legal route to bring families together through its refugee family reunion policy. Last year 7,482 family reunion visas were issued to partners and children of those previously granted asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK, 37% more than the previous year. “By allowing children to sponsor their parents, we would risk giving unscrupulous criminal gangs an incentive to split families and send children on dangerous journeys to the UK alone.”"
2020-10-28T18:09:15Z,Canadians increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees – study,"Despite a global pandemic that has destroyed economies and fanned nationalism around the world, Canadians say they are increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees. A new study from the polling firm Environics Institute found that attitudes among Canadians have become increasingly positive, even as millions remain out of work and the country faces grim economic projections. “These views are not a blip. They’re not chance. They seem to be deeply rooted and widely spread,” said Andrew Parkin, executive director at Environics. Since 1976, the Focus Canada survey, administered by Environics, has periodically sampled Canadians to gauge their views on the topic. The latest results, released in early October, show for the first time ever that Canadians are more likely than not to reject the idea that immigrants are not adopting Canadian values. At the same time, a large majority of Canadians continue to see immigrants as critical to the Canadian economy and don’t feel they take jobs away from other Canadians. Close to one-third of Canadians say that too many refugee claimants are not “real” refugees – sharply down from 79% in 1987. Researchers were curious to see if recent world events had dramatically shifted opinion, said Parkin. “At first, we thought maybe Donald Trump would knock these positive trends. Maybe Canadians would catch the vibe of what’s going on in the States and start pulling back. That didn’t happen,” he said. The emergence in 2019 of the anti-immigration People’s Party of Canada also failed to shift opinions. Even the pandemic, which has so far millions of jobs and left Canadians in precarious financial situations, has not turned residents negative towards newcomers. “If these views are not going to get knocked back by politics in the United States or a major health or an economic crisis, they’re probably not going to get knocked back,” he said. The shifting attitudes are not found just in heavily populated and diverse cities like Toronto. Pollsters recorded increasing openness among older residents aligned with conservative political parties and in regions that have faced economic devastation. Parkin pointed to Atlantic Canada, often compared to the US rust belt or northern England – rural areas where industry has left, the population is poorer and residents are older. “In other countries, this all correlates with less openness to immigration. But in Atlantic Canada, they’ve realized that the more immigrants they have, the more businesses that are going to get started there.” Part of this is probably the geographical realities of immigration to Canada. “For years, we’ve essentially had the luxury of being able to choose our immigrants because of where we’re located,” said Parkin, noting that Canada has largely favoured skilled immigrants. At the same time, immigrants and visible minorities often face greater challenges navigating daily life in the country. Members of Canada’s Asian community have reported a significant increase in harassment following the arrival of the coronavirus – experiences corroborated by data from Statistics Canada. And in recent months, leaders across the country have admitted that systemic racism places a heavy – often violent – burden on visible minorities. While the survey results suggest an openness to newcomers, Parkin admits the underlying causes are difficult to determine. Political unrest and xenophobia in America might be a key factor. Instead of Trump’s xenophobic views spilling over the border, Parkin suspects they have had the opposite effect in Canada. “It actually seems to have reinforced our sense of distinctiveness.” The unifying message of the pandemic – that everyone is in the situation together – might have also contributed to this shift, along with the belief that immigrants help the economy. “Increasingly, people see this not as an issue, but a question of identity,” he said. “And Canadians often see themselves as welcoming to people from all over the world.”"
2020-10-01T19:49:35Z,Thousands of migrants cross into Guatemala with slim hopes of reaching US,"Thousands of Honduran migrants hoping to reach the United States have entered Guatemala, testing the newly reopened frontier that had been shut by the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities had planned to register the migrants as they crossed and offer assistance to those willing to turn back, but early on Thursday, the group pushed past armed guards without registering. By midday more than 3,000 migrants had crossed illegally, said Guatemalan officials. The caravan is the biggest since the coronavirus pandemic hit Central America in March, shutting off travel as well as triggering a rise in unemployment and poverty. Before the crossing happened, Edwin Omar Molino, a 17-year-old from Cortés, said he wanted to leave Honduras because he couldn’t find work. “Even when you want to find a job, there aren’t any. That’s why we leave our country,” Molino said. “There’s the pandemic, and it scares me,” he added. But he said he wouldn’t be able to help his family get ahead without taking the risk. Central American migrants began traveling in large groups in recent years, seeking safety in numbers and in some cases avoiding the cost of smugglers. Calls for a new migrant caravan to leave on 1 October had circulated for weeks on social media. The odds of a large migrant caravan reaching the US border, already low, have grown increasingly slim over the past year. Under pressure from the United States, Mexico deployed its national guard and more immigration agents to break up attempted caravans last year. Actually crossing into the US legally is virtually impossible now with the pandemic, and entering illegally is as difficult as ever. The departure of the new group was reminiscent of a migrant caravan that formed two years ago shortly before US midterm elections. It became a hot issue in the campaign, fueling anti-immigrant rhetoric. But while the caravans draw attention, they account for a small fraction of the daily migration flow by small groups that pass unnoticed through Central America and Mexico. The migrants who arrived at the Guatemala border on Thursday had set out walking the previous night from San Pedro Sula, and many wore masks. They appeared to be mostly young men, though there were the occasional small children being pushed in strollers. Mexico’s immigration agency said in a statement that it would enforce “safe, orderly and legal” migration and not do anything to promote the formation of a caravan. The US embassy in Honduras said on Twitter on Wednesday that migration to the US was more difficult than ever right now – and more dangerous because of the coronavirus. But the factors driving migrants to leave Central America have not eased during the pandemic. As economies have suffered, there are ever fewer jobs to be had, and the struggle for families to put food on the table has only worsened. The UN’s International Labor Organization said on Wednesday that at least 34m jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the pandemic. The ILO lists Latin America and the Caribbean as the worst-hit region in the world in terms of lost working hours, with a drop of 20.9% in the first three quarters of the year. The flow of migrants north from Central America had slowed dramatically during the pandemic as countries throughout the region closed their borders."
2020-08-30T16:03:17Z,Migrant boat bursts into flames off southern Italian coast,"A boat carrying dozens of refugees has burst into flames off the coast of southern Italy as its passengers were being transferred to Italian naval vessels to take them to port. Three people are confirmed dead and three are missing at sea. Six people are in hospital with serious burns injuries, including two Italian officials who were taking the people off the boat. The vessel was approached by an Italian naval ship that was in the process of taking migrants onboard and, according to preliminary reports, suddenly caught fire, most likely because of a fuel leakage, then exploded. The number of victims is still uncertain. Bathers at a beach near Crotone watched dark smoke pour out of the vessel on the sunny Sunday afternoon. Red Cross commissioner Francesco Pascuzzo said: “Four miles from the coast, something caught fire and the boat exploded, causing serious damage. It’s a tragic situation. “Between five and seven migrants are feared missing. Four migrants are in hospital with serious burn injuries, and two rescue workers have suffered injuries. Twelve migrants were transported to a welcome centre.” A reconnaissance plane is searching for survivors at sea. Meanwhile, a boat with 450 migrants onboard was rescued by the Italian coastguard off the island of Lampedusa as it risked capsizing in strong winds. In the last 24 hours, a further 500 migrants have arrived at Lampedusa on small boats, causing a backlash among a portion of the local population. “We’re on our knees,” said Salvatore Martello, mayor of Lampedusa. “The situation is unbearable. Either the government has to take immediate decisions, or the entire island will go on strike.” On Saturday, the UN refugee agency urged European nations to let in hundreds of people rescued from the Mediterranean by humanitarian boats, including one vessel financed by the British street artist Banksy. The UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said more than 200 rescued refugees needed to get off the nonprofit search-and-rescue ship Louise Michel immediately, saying it was far beyond its safe capacity. The plea from UNHCR and IOM also mentioned hundreds of migrants on two other charity ships in urgent need of safe harbour. On Saturday, the Italian coastguard answered a distress call from the Louise Michel, and took charge of 49 of the people who were most in need of help, it said. By late Saturday night, all passengers on the Louise Michel had been transferred to the SeaWatch4, which was left with about 350 people onboard. It was looking for a safe seaport to disembark the passengers. So far in 2020, more than 500 refugees are known to have died in the Mediterranean, and the real number is estimated to be considerably higher."
2020-11-15T08:00:29Z,Migrant children’s welfare is being sidelined in UK’s ‘brutal push to deport’,"Home Office officials have expressed concern that the welfare of children and families who have crossed the Channel to the UK is being “compromised” by an intent to prosecute individuals for immigration offences, internal emails and documents reveal. At least one senior safeguarding official has resigned over what they described as an example of the hostile environment still being used to target vulnerable new arrivals. One email from a safeguarding expert, whose brief was to inform the Home Office on the welfare needs of families due to be forcibly deported, questioned the use of restraint and “physical intervention” on children. Correspondence sent to the home secretary, Priti Patel, also reveals how an official stepped down because they did not want to “compromise the safety and wellbeing of children and families to facilitate the proliferation of an enforcement agenda”. The former safeguarding expert told the Observer that a change in the Home Office’s approach to families and children they were preparing to deport was reflected in the language of some officials. Requesting anonymity, they said: “The Home Office began undermining our welfare advice, and we started seeing quite crude assumptions made about the credibility of individuals such as asylum seekers trying to scrounge off the state or being called illegals. “I had to bite my lip. It was basic, crude and quite brutal. Children were being put to one side to focus on immigration issues.” Another email seen by the Observer also questioned if some families who crossed the Channel in small boats were being “immediately turned around and sent back to France under an obscure article”. Earlier this year, reports alleged the Home Office had launched an initiative to return migrants swiftly to France before their asylum claims were properly considered. Details of cases of concern are outlined in other emails including a family where the children were seemingly separated from parents who were subsequently restrained on the way to a deportation flight. Another highlighted case involves an Iranian teenager who was caring for her young brother and whom the Home Office twice attempted to deport before an intervention by safeguarding officials ensured they were eventually allowed to remain in the UK. Dan Sohege, director of human rights advocacy group Stand for All and a refugee law specialist, said: “It’s a very disturbing direction of travel the Home Office is going in. They are looking at exclusionary measures rather than supporting those, particularly children, who absolutely need support.” The disclosures follow attacks by Priti Patel on lawyers who she claims frustrate attempts to deport failed asylum seekers. Safeguarding officials, according to the emails, were also concerned that similar arguments have been raised in relation to deporting families with references to “high numbers of cases where further submissions and judicial reviews present barriers to removal”. However, the officials say they are legitimate legal challenges made under asylum law, and that one reference to “high numbers” was actually only 17 judicial review applications in a year. Other concerns relate to claims of information on sensitive cases being withheld from a body called the Independent Family Returns Panel (IFRP), which provides advice on the welfare plans for the forced deportation of families with children. Among the information allegedly held back from the IFRP were details on potential trafficking victims, while one message claims that the Home Office blocked a trip to Italy for the panel to evaluate the condition of reception facilities before leaving the EU. “We remain concerned about the reported situation for returnees [in Italy],” said one email. Other areas of disquiet include the holding of child refugees who have crossed the Channel in the “inappropriate accommodation” of a Kent holding facility with some detained for more than 18 hours when they arrive. Last month, it emerged one 15-year-old boy was held for over 66 hours. The Home Office has been contacted for comment."
2020-12-15T06:29:04Z,Refugees detained in Melbourne hotel 'devastated' as they await move to another site,"Refugees and asylum seekers detained at a Melbourne hotel for more than a year are said to be “devastated” and “confused” as they await their relocation to another as-yet undisclosed site. About 60 men, who are detained at the Mantra hotel in Preston in Melbourne’s north, were told by the Australian border force on Monday they would soon be moved because the contract with the hotel was expiring. They received no further details. The announcement dashed hopes that the men might be released into the community, after five asylum seekers were granted visas last week. The five, like the men at the Mantra hotel, were brought to Australia from Manus Island under the now-defunct medevac legislation. As part of the Lives in Limbo series, Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday that the vast majority of the 192 refugees and asylum seekers who were evacuated to Australia for medical treatment are still being detained. Alison Battisson, a lawyer who represents four of the men at the Mantra, said it was still unclear when the men would be moved, though she expected the relocation to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday. In the meantime, advocates have formed a picket line outside the hotel, where they are expected to stay until the men are moved. Battisson said her clients were “devastated” and “very disappointed” by the Border Force announcement on Monday, especially given some of their friends had been released last week. Noeline Harendran, of Sydney West Legal, which also represents some people detained at the Mantra, said her clients were “anxious and really confused”. “They haven’t been able to have fresh air, sunlight, since the beginning of the year,” she said. “They can’t go for walks outside, things that people have taken for granted, they haven’t been able to do.” The five people released last week, who were represented by Sydney West Legal, were granted visas days before the federal government was required to make submissions in their cases to the federal court. Harendran said she was still hopeful the men at the Mantra would also be released into the community. One refugee there, Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, said Border Force officials had provided few details on Monday. “They didn’t talk about [a] visa, they said there’s no visa or any other information,” he said. “I said, ‘Where is the location?’ And they said they didn’t know. I said, ‘Is it Christmas Island?’ And they said no.” On Monday the Department of Home Affairs said the men would be relocated to another site in Melbourne. It added that no one who had been under the regional processing regime would be settled in Australia. Azimitabar said he and his fellow detainees were thankful to dozens of protesters who had rallied outside the hotel until 4am on Tuesday. “They give us hope, always,” he said. “We are all sad, we are all depressed, upset. But when we see people protesting for us, we are hopeful. It helps us not to give up.” Omar Hassan, from the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism, said some of the detainees had been communicating with the protesters from their windows on Monday night. “We were doing call-and-response chants … they were doing the classic symbol of resistance [crossing their arms above their heads],” Hassan said. “They keep shouting, ‘Thank you, thank you.’” Dozens of protesters including refugee advocates and trade unionistswere again gathering at the site on Tuesday evening. Another of the detainees, Ismail Hussein, 29, from Somalia, told Guardian Australia on Monday the conditions were “more difficult than what we experienced in Manus Island”. “Maybe one hour of gym – that’s the only time that I am not in my room,” he said. “The rest of the day, I’m lying on my bed or sitting on the chair.” The Department of Home Affairs was contacted for further comment."
2020-11-09T17:37:54Z,EU draft declaration sets out stricter rules on migrant integration,"Migrants to Europe must learn the language of their new home countries and encourage their children to integrate in the light of the recent Islamist terror attacks, EU governments plan to say in a declaration drafted by France, Austria and Germany. The contentious draft statement, due to be made by EU home affairs ministers on Friday, is being championed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was accused by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of religious persecution after his recent warning of the dangers of Islamist separatism. It will also say Brussels should fund religious education within Muslim communities, and NGOs publishing “content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving” state support under the terms of the resolution. There is some unease among fellow EU governments about the framing of the current draft, however. Sweden, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, among others, have traditionally pushed back against those who have viewed migration and religion through the prism of security. “Singling out a religion or group is never the answer to violent extremism by individuals,” said one senior EU diplomat. “We should do well to remember that embracing fundamental values isn’t just a responsibility of migrants or the Muslim community but for all us. We should be careful not to bring down our accomplishments by other people’s sins.” Should the statement be pulled before Friday, EU diplomats believe Macron will seek to push it again at a meeting of the bloc’s 27 heads of state and government in two weeks time. In a letter to the Financial Times in which Macron complained about an article criticising his approach – now withdrawn from the newspaper’s website – the president wrote that he would “not allow anybody to claim that France, or its government, is fostering racism against Muslims”. The current draft ministerial declaration says that the recent terrorist atrocities in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, Nice and Vienna have revealed the “extent of the threat we face from Islamist terrorism”. Alongside a series of technical counter-terrorism proposals, including the creation of backdoor access to encrypted communications used in chat apps, the statement proposes a tougher line on the need for migrants to integrate. “Successful integration of immigrants with a sense of belonging and equality is of central importance for the social cohesion of our modern pluralist, and open societies,” the draft says. “Integration is a two-way street: providing support but expecting more in return (fordern und fördern) is a core principle in this. This means that migrants are expected to make an active effort to become integrated while they are offered help with integration through government integration measures. “Along with recognition of European values, what successful integration means above all is learning the language of one’s new country, earning a living for oneself and for one’s family, and supporting the integration of one’s children … “It needs to be possible to sanction sustained refusal to integrate more strongly than has been the case to date. Organisations that support content hostile to integration will be excluded from receiving public funding.” The declaration further suggests that the European commission should fund religious education and training among imams. “We want to strengthen European Muslims as our partners in the fight against Islamist extremism for they too are its victims,” it says. “We want to support them in their efforts to organise their religion independently of foreign interference. In our view it is necessary to develop a shared language at European level which distinguishes between Islam and Islamism in the sense of religiously motivate extremism.” Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium who is now president of the European Council, tweeted: “To fight the Ideology of Hatred, we need to setup as soon as possible a European Institute to train imams in Europe. “Online messages glorifying terrorism must be quickly removed. There must be no impunity for terrorists and those praising them on internet.”"
2020-10-18T22:30:01Z,Australia's refugee intake falls 30% below target as pandemic takes toll,"The home affairs department has reported a significant reduction in the number of visas being granted – including refugee visas, which have been reduced by almost a third – in large part due to the pandemic. Despite the drop in visa numbers, the department still raised $2.2bn in revenue through applications. Of the 13,171 humanitarian places the department reported as delivered, 11,521 were given to refugees outside of Australia who had been assessed as needing protection. The government has set a target of 18,750 places, meaning home affairs failed to meet its metric, delivering almost 30% less places than the year before. Three-quarters of the humanitarian offshore visas were delivered to those in Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Middle East, while “vulnerable” people (women, children, LGBTIQ people) made up 21%. Just under 45% of those granted humanitarian visas have been settled in regions outside of Sydney, Melbourne and greater Brisbane, as part of the government’s plan to settle refugees and migrants away from Australia’s major centres. “The humanitarian program was not fully delivered in 2019–20 due to the temporary suspension of granting of all offshore humanitarian visas in March 2020 as a result of Covid-19 travel restrictions,” the department said in its latest annual report. “This followed the announcement by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and the International Organization for Migration of a suspension of resettlement travel on 16 March 2020 due to Covid-19.” It wasn’t just humanitarian visas which were down. Overall, the department recorded an almost 25% decrease in visa lodgements after Australia closed its international borders. Visa cancellations due to the public health orders were not included as part of the home affairs remit. “The administration of Australia’s migration program was significantly impacted by Covid-19 and associated travel restrictions,” the department reported. “The department delivered 140,366 permanent placements, down from 160,323 in 2018–19. Although the number of temporary and permanent visa applications reduced by 2.3 million in comparison to 2018–19, the department continued to contribute to Australia’s economic prosperity through granting 6.5 million temporary visas, compared to 8.8 million granted in 2018–19. “The department maintained its focus on the integrity of the migration program with 325,637 temporary and permanent (non-humanitarian) visas refused, a decrease of 13.7% on 2018–19.” How visas are granted in Australia has come under renewed scrutiny after former New South Wales MP Daryl Maguire was linked to a “cash for visa” scheme which has formed part of the investigations by Icac, the NSW corruption watchdog. Home affairs is one of the first departments to be questioned in budget estimates this week. The visa scheme will be one of the issues canvassed by non-government senators during the hearing on Monday, with clarification wanted over the state and federal ties. Australians stranded overseas will also form part of the hearing. Close to 30,000 have registered to come home. Last week the federal government announced another 5,000 or so Australians could be catered for between now and March with the inclusion of the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs centre in the quarantine program, but critics point out that won’t do much to increase the numbers of Australians being brought home or stem the flow of those being added to the list. Meanwhile, home affairs also reported almost 2,200 calls were made to its national security hotline in relation to foreign interference concerns. Departmental officials pointed to an increased awareness due to the government’s new focus on the issue, with universities one of the key stakeholders asking for clarification. “Call rates are likely to increase further throughout 2020–21 as awareness of the program continues to expand,” a spokesperson said."
2020-08-15T13:15:43Z,"Give refugees crossing Channel a chance, say Windrush survivors","Survivors of the Windrush scandal have attacked the home secretary, saying her approach to the Channel migrant crossings is creating “the same set of conditions” that led to the government victimising the children of Commonwealth immigrants. A letter to Priti Patel from 100 prominent refugee and human rights campaigners, including members of the Windrush generation, warns that the “pattern of ignoring expert advice, failing to engage with civil society and branding migrants as criminal” replicates Home Office failings that caused the 2018 Windrush scandal. They also believe Patel’s hard-nosed strategy contravenes a central recommendation from the Windrush Lessons Learned Review that urges the Home Office to implement policies based on evidence and transparent decision-making. Among the signatories is Michael Braithwaite, who arrived from Barbados as a child in 1961 and lost his job as a special needs teaching assistant two years ago for not having an up-to-date identity document. The 68-year-old said: “The Home Office doesn’t care. They need to give people a chance. They’re making a life-threatening journey – babies, mums and kids.” More than 4,000 people have successfully crossed the Channel in boats this year, which Patel said was “appalling”, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called “very bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal”. The letter, dated 14 August and whose signatories include the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, Oxfam, Liberty, Refugee Action and the Runnymede Trust, also condemns Home Office officials and Patel for attempting to discredit lawyers who represent asylum seekers. Patel told Tory MPs last week that the asylum system was being “exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers” who were stopping the government removing people. The letter also points out that Patel’s attitude to asylum seekers is typified by last week’s response of a senior Home Office source to criticism from the ice-cream makers Ben and Jerry’s. After the firm urged her to show more “humanity” and reminded her that “people cannot be illegal”, the source accused it of selling “overpriced junk food”. James Cleverly, a Foreign Office minister, then tweeted: “Can I have a large scoop of statistically inaccurate virtue signalling with my grossly overpriced ice-cream, please?” Government and ministerial statements have also repeatedly labelled the crossings illegal, which the letter reminds Patel is inaccurate. Also signed by Bail for Immigration Detainees, Praxis, Safe Passage, Detention Action and Help Refugees, the letter, states: “To brand this as ‘illegal’ or ‘criminal’ activity is irresponsible and wrong, and is precisely the same rhetoric that led to the wrongful detention and deportation of the Windrush generation. “The government must stop using such language and misstating the law.” It highlighted the fact that the foreign affairs select committee – when Patel was a member – and the Windrush inquiry by Wendy Williams pointed out the dangers of wrongly using the language of criminality. It also states: “It is precisely the refusal to listen to evidence and advice, the refusal to recognise the humanity of those affected, and the same attitude which treats outside expertise and knowledge as opposition, which has led to chaos and dysfunction in the Home Office.” The UN’s refugee agency last night voiced dismay over the UK government’s posturing on an issue that most experts say involves only small numbers in asylum terms. Laura Padoan, of the UNHCR, said senior government figures needed to avoid “escalating tensions with inflammatory rhetoric and responses that are not proportionate to the scale of what’s happening”. The UN’s migration agency, the IOM, also cautioned that the government’s populist language hardened attitudes and could “feed into xenophobic narratives”. Although more than 4,000 people have crossed the Channel in at least 300 boats so far this year the UK received 35,566 asylum applications last year, while France received 123,900 and Germany 142,500."
2020-10-02T12:50:25Z,Matteo Salvini goes on trial over migrant kidnapping charges,"Italy’s far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini goes on trial on Saturday on kidnapping charges over an incident in 2019 when 116 migrants were prevented from disembarking a coastguard ship in the Mediterranean. Prosecutors in the Sicilian city of Catania accuse the League party leader of abusing his powers to block people from disembarking from the Gregoretti coastguard boat under his “closed ports” policy. The 47-year-old called on his supporters to descend on the courtroom in Catania to protest against what he has described as a plot against him. “I will plead guilty to defending Italy and the Italians,” Salvini told the press last week. Fellow far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, has promised to attend the rally, while the ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who has faced several trials himself, will send a delegation from his Forza Italia party. Salvini’s fortunes have waned since he withdrew the League from its fractious governing alliance with the Five Star Movement (M5S) in August 2019 in an attempt to capitalise upon his high poll ratings and seize the prime ministership. His rallies are disrupted by protesters and people often challenge him in the streets. As well as having his judgment questioned by people in his own party, he is embroiled in a series of legal wrangles, the majority connected to his tenure as a hardline interior minister. One of Salvini’s first moves when he took office in June 2018 was to declare Italian ports closed to ships engaged in rescuing people fleeing Libya by boat. There were subsequently 25 standoffs between rescue vessels and Italian authorities, some of which became the focus of criminal investigations. The case coming before the court on Saturday relates to a group of migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean in two separate operations on 25 June last year after five days at sea. There were 15 unaccompanied children among them. They were transferred to the Gregoretti on 26 July, then held on the overcrowded patrol vessel under a fierce summer sun – despite a scabies outbreak and a suspected case of tuberculosis. The unaccompanied children were allowed off on 29 July following pressure from Catania’s youth court. The remaining migrants disembarked 31 July after Salvini said a deal had been brokered with EU countries to take them. A few months later, the Catania prosecutor’s office placed Salvini under investigation and in February this year the Italian senate formally authorised criminal proceedings. His defence team insists the decision to hold the people on the ship was not Salvini’s alone, but reached collectively within the government. It will be up to a preliminary hearing judge to decide whether the case is strong enough to proceed with the trial. Observers say Salvini erred politically when he withdrew the League from government in August last year. He did not anticipate that the antiestablishment 5SM and centre-left Democratic party would put aside their deep enmity and go into coalition themselves, leaving the League on the opposition benches. “Once Salvini reached the peak of his rise, believing himself invincible, he lost his lucidity and made one mistake after another,” said Matteo Pucciarelli, a journalist at La Repubblica and author of a book about Salvini. “After kicking himself out of the government, he is now slowly losing the leadership of the right to Meloni.” Salvini’s attempts to keep his anti-migrant rhetoric front and centre in Italian politics this year, by linking the coronavirus pandemic to migrant arrivals, have failed to cut through. “The strategy to exploit migrants, citing they were threatening Italy by bringing Covid-19 with them, simply did not work,” said Pucciarelli. “Migrants were no longer at the top of the minds of Italians who have had more serious issues to think about during the pandemic.” Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Mercatorum University in Rome, said Salvini’s rhetoric around invading migrants infected with Covid-19 was not credible to Italians. “In addition, the management of the pandemic in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the coronavirus – and governed by the League - has been very controversial and characterised by numerous political errors,” Panarari said. “The fact that this region was governed by Salvini’s party has had a negative impact on its popularity.” Despite the setbacks, Salvini still has a strong support base and is expected to be able to rally thousands to his cause in Catania on Saturday. Asked recently whether he would prevent the disembarkation if he could go back in time, he replied: ‘‘It is not that I would do it again – I am going to do it again.”"
2020-10-03T15:39:17Z,Italy's PM called to testify at Salvini migrant kidnap trial,"Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been summoned to testify in the trial of the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini, who is accused of kidnapping 131 migrants after he prevented them from disembarking from a coastguard ship in 2019. During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini repeatedly denied access to ports to ships carrying rescued migrants. The policy resulted in numerous standoffs, leaving migrants stuck at sea for weeks before European countries could identify a port that was willing to accept them, or courts intervened. On 25 July 2019, the coastguard ship Gregoretti was heading to Italy with more than 130 migrants on board, but once they arrived off the coast of Lampedusa, Salvini denied them permission to dock. The migrants and coastguard officers remained on the ship for six days. After sanitary conditions on the vessel became worrying, the migrants were authorised to disembark on the evening of 31 July. Sicilian prosecutors placed Salvini under investigation a few months later, and the Italian senate formally authorised criminal proceedings against the leader of the League in February. “I will plead guilty to defending Italy and the Italians,” Salvini told the press last week. The first preliminary hearing began on Saturday in a courtroom in Catania, and there was no shortage of controversies. Catania’s prosecutors, known for launching several investigations against rescue boats operated by aid groups and who in this trial should be arguing against Salvini, asked the judge to drop the charges. They said the decision to prevent the migrants from disembarking was political and was intended to “redistribute the passengers to other European countries”. Judge Nunzio Sarpietro, however, has decided he wants clarification, so he has summoned Conte, the foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, and the former infrastructure and transport minister, Danilo Toninelli. All were part of the government at that time with Salvini, before he withdrew from the coalition. Salvini’s defence team insists that the decision to hold the people on the ship was not Salvini’s alone, but reached collectively from within the government. It will be up to a preliminary hearing judge to decide whether the case is strong enough for the trial to proceed. The first step is to understand whether Salvini acted alone, or if he was the simple executor of an agreed decision supported by the government at the time. Sarpietro has also requested the acquisition of other evidence relating to numerous cases in which Salvini prohibited the landing of migrants. Conte was called to testify at the next hearing on 20 November. “It was my first time in court as a potential culprit and defendant,” Salvini told the press after the trial. ‘‘Now, I keep going, with my head held high, certain that I have always acted in the defence of the homeland and for the safety of Italians.”"
2020-12-07T15:00:41Z,No Hard Feelings review – life lessons and love stories in a refugee shelter,"The winner of the Berlin film festival’s Teddy award for best queer-themed film begins as shuffling character study, then broadens out to resemble Jules et Jim or The Dreamers yanked brusquely into an urgent multicultural present. Its focal point is Parvis (Benjamin Radjaipour), a gay twentysomething German of Iranian descent obliged to assume greater responsibility after community service carries him into a refugee shelter; there he gravitates towards Amon (Eidin Jalali) and Banafshe (Banafshe Hourmazdi), Iranian siblings facing imminent deportation. Any trace of piousness in the setup is dispelled by an early, frenzied burst of man-on-man face-sitting: from the off, it’s a film caught between worlds, juggling Parvis’s casual hook-ups with his growing bond to contemporaries living more precariously. Presented in Academy ratio, with Andrea Arnold-like dreamy interludes, Faraz Shariat’s debut is quietly shrewd about checking its characters’ privilege. Dubbed an ausländer (foreigner) and living at home with uncomprehending parents, Parvis may think he has it bad, but he also has the paperwork allowing him to stay out at night. His soured fling with an older Caucasian contrasts with a scene in which Banafshe fends off an overreaching caseworker; the condescension and exploitation in play doesn’t appear wildly different. Gradually, that square frame becomes a window on to the European project itself. Sometimes those within it integrate, sometimes they struggle – though Shariat ensures their efforts yield a range of experiences, often as heady as they are chastening. So naturally does the film fall in step with its young leads – the director is only 26 himself – that it can feel callow in places. There’s a lot of aimless hanging out in the first half, and Shariat can’t resist the abiding visual cliche of Teddy award contenders: the overhead shot of photogenic players sprawled on their backs, heads resting in or near one another’s laps. Yet those players are strong, flicking eloquently and revealingly between German and Farsi, and the care taken to hear out Parvis’s parents – not hardline conservatives, but gentle souls (played by the director’s own family) whose hard work has afforded their offspring the opportunity to slope around – speaks to promising reserves of directorial curiosity and generosity. • No Hard Feelings is available on digital platforms from 7 December."
2020-08-20T18:33:16Z,The Guardian view on migrant deaths: hard hearts are cause for alarm | Editorial,"If anyone needed a reminder of what is at stake for the thousands of migrants and refugees trying to cross the Channel this summer, the circumstances surrounding the death of a young Sudanese man whose body was found on a beach near Calais have supplied it. The refugee, Abdulfatah Hamdallah, was found on Wednesday after trying to reach England in a dinghy with shovels for oars. Since people traffickers do not appear to have been involved, the tragedy has also revealed the mendacious inadequacy of the version of events being peddled by ministers. Their desperation to blame anyone but themselves for the present situation has resulted in an overemphasis on the role of smugglers and alleged failings by the French. Reports of the deaths of at least 45 people, including five children, off the coast of Libya, would be what the UN refugee agency has called the deadliest shipwreck in that stretch of water this year. The discovery of 10 dead people on another boat near the Canary Islands is a further reminder of the terrible hazards faced by those who flee their homes and countries in search of a better life for themselves and, increasingly, for their children. The range of the victims’ nationalities makes abundantly clear the problem’s global scale. While survivors in Libya were primarily said to come from Senegal, Mali, Chad and Ghana, recent arrivals in Kent have included people fleeing Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt and Syria. Obviously, there is no single solution to the multiple crises affecting countries around the world, one of the consequences of which is that millions of people are desperate to leave them. Just as obviously, the strategy most likely to lead to good outcomes is for countries to work together. This means long-term commitments to help poor countries to raise living standards and reduce conflict, as well as a joined-up approach to migration and the rights of refugees. For the UK government, one urgent priority must be to establish safe, legal means for asylum seekers to lodge claims. For the prime minister to denounce the current spate of Channel crossings as “dangerous and criminal”, while offering no alternative, is wrong in every way. A recent poll finding that 49% of British adults had little or no sympathy for Channel migrants offered an alarming glimpse of the extent to which hearts have hardened. Too much emphasis should never be placed on one survey, but the myths about migration are ingrained. Partly this is the result of deliberately inflammatory politics pursued over many years with a view to attracting voters thought to be hostile to immigration. To her shame, Priti Patel’s recent efforts in this vein won praise from Nigel Farage. But it also seems tangled up in many people’s confused image of the UK as simultaneously a put-upon small island and a global power. It is to their great discredit that ministers seem trapped in their own version of this, as they overreact to the increase in arrivals in Kent while making unrealistic demands of the EU, which has just rejected their proposal to extend current asylum arrangements beyond the transition period. Given that Germany last year registered 142,450 applications, almost three times the UK’s total of 44,250, it is little wonder that our neighbours have lost patience. Far more disturbing is the possibility that, in the nationalistic fug of Brexit, the UK government has lost sight of its international obligations and the basic standards of human decency they represent."
2020-10-30T06:01:04Z,UN urges UK to restart resettlement of refugees after family drowns in Channel,"The UK government needs to urgently restart its resettlement scheme after two young children and their parents died while trying to cross the Channel, the UN refugee agency’s UK representative has said. Iranian Kurds Rasul Iran Nezhad and his wife, Shiva Mohammad Panahi, both 35, and two of their children, Anita, nine, and Armin, six, drowned on Tuesday as they tried to reach Britain by boat. The fate of the family’s third child, 15-month-old Artin, is unknown. Their deaths have led to renewed calls for the UK government to abandon its hardline approach to asylum seekers and expand or create safe and legal routes for migrants fleeing torture and death to travel to the UK and claim for protection. One such route would be the UK’s global resettlement scheme, which facilitates the transfer of recognised refugees from an asylum country to the UK with the aim of permanent settlement. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) assesses and grants refugee status. The scheme, which is supposed to resettle about 5,000 refugees a year, has been suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic. UNHCR’s UK representative, Rossella Pagliuchi-Lor, said: “UNHCR hopes that resettlement to the UK will restart very soon, once reception capacity is confirmed and any remaining logistical issues related to Covid are overcome by the authorities. The pandemic has presented new, acute hardships and uncertainties for refugees. “The tragic events in the Channel this week demonstrate again the need for concerted international efforts to address the complex root causes of displacement. Reopening and expanding legal pathways for more refugees to come to the UK in safety is one tangible way that this country can help.” Pagliuchi-Lor’s intervention comes as UNHCR launches a series highlighting the benefits of the UK’s community sponsorship programme. The programme, which has been running since 2016, enables community groups to become directly involved in supporting refugee families resettled in the UK through the currently suspended resettlement programme. “Community sponsorship is transformative,” said Pagliuchi-Lor. “It provides refugee families with a support network to help them adapt, learn and become independent more quickly. “But it also has a real effect on local volunteers, binding them together in a common cause and allowing them, in a small way, to be part of the global solution to forced displacement.” UNHCR travelled the UK last year chronicling the lives of five refugee families and their community supporters in Wales, Devon, Liverpool, Greater Manchester and London, and has pulled together images and videos for a series illustrating the scheme. More than 7,400 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, according to analysis by PA Media, nearly four times as many as in 2019. A record 416 arrived on a single day on 2 September. Seven migrants have died trying to cross the Channel this year, three more than last year. UNHCR joins groups such as Safe Passage, Amnesty and Choose Love/Help Refugees in calling for safe alternatives to the government’s current focus on physically obstructing the crossings. Other options, such as cross-border family reunion arrangements, are the best way to reduce the number of attempted crossings, the groups have said, although the UK government rejected amendments to its immigration bill as recently as last week that would have ensured that rights under British law to family reunion continued after the Brexit transition period. The Home Office has been approached for comment."
2020-10-23T05:00:01Z,Kent inspectors find wet and cold migrants held in cramped containers,"Hundreds of wet and cold migrants were forced to spend hours in cramped containers on a “rubble-strewn building site” after arriving in the UK on small boats, a report has revealed. In a rare insight into how newly arrived asylum seekers are treated by authorities, prison inspectors visited Tug Haven in Dover, where migrants are first taken from the beach or sea, and found a shortage of dry clothing and other basic supplies. Images show migrants queueing at Tug Haven surrounded by rubble and temporary fencing. Windowless shipping containers were used to hold the arrivals. More than 7,400 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, according to analysis by PA Media, nearly four times as many as in 2019, with a record 416 arriving on a single day on 2 September. All migrants are taken to Tug Haven for “processing” before heading to other short-term facilities. On the day of the inspection, 200 people arrived. The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said the numbers were no excuse for the conditions at Tug Haven and other sites, and criticised the Home Office for failing to plan “for what must have been a predictable increase” in arrivals from across the Channel. “Just because numbers are unprecedented, that does not mean they are unpredictable, or cannot be planned for,” he said. “While the number of arrivals had been far higher in 2020 than in previous years, the reception arrangements at Tug Haven were not fit for even small numbers. This was readily acknowledged by local Home Office staff, who were themselves working in challenging conditions.” Newly arrived detainees were triaged at Tug Haven for urgent medical conditions and symptoms of Covid-19, the report said. A designated van was available where migrants would be seated if they displayed any symptoms of the virus. Despite the poor conditions, the detainees – mainly from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Eritrea – who were interviewed by inspectors were almost all positive about the way individual staff at Tug Haven treated them. In September, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons visited short-term immigration detention holding facilities at Tug Haven, the Kent Intake Unit in Dover, Frontier House in Folkestone, Lunar House in Croydon and Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre in Bedford, which had been re-designated as a short-term holding facility. Inspectors said the Kent Intake Unit and Frontier House were not suitable for “very lengthy detentions” but some detainees were held for more than two days in rooms with no sleeping facilities, showers or access to the open air. Social distancing was not possible, and there were some basic omissions, inspectors said, such as not providing handwashing facilities or sanitiser in the women’s toilets. On average, children were held at the Kent Intake Unit for 17 hours, which was longer than the average for adults. In one case, a 15-year-old boy was held for over 66 hours. Other findings by the inspectors included: inspectors identified weaknesses in child safeguarding procedures and in one case a child was mistakenly taken to a detention centre for adults; children were held for too long and often overnight, partly because Kent county council’s social services department no longer has the capacity to care for unaccompanied minors; one family group, held in Frontier House for 45 hours, included a baby and other children, aged five, seven, nine and 10; detainees arriving at Tug Haven routinely had their mobile phones confiscated, while detainees in Yarl’s Wood are banned from using social media; Tinsley House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick, is now receiving small boat arrivals. Bridget Chapman, a caseworker and spokesperson for Kent Refugee Action Network, said the report contained “a litany of serious problems”. “As a charity working with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Kent, it is our duty to speak up on their behalf, and we would like a reassurance that this terrible and dangerous mistake will not be repeated. “Asylum-seeking people are arriving here seeking sanctuary. Instead of taking care of them, the government is placing them in what amounts to inhuman and degrading conditions. This shames us all and has to be rectified with immediate effect.” Minnie Rahman, public affairs and campaigns manager at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: “The Home Office could and should take simple, practical steps to treat newly arrived asylum seekers with humanity: house them, support them and process their claims properly. Instead, politicians are neglecting people’s basic needs while at the same time using them as fodder for their PR cannon, releasing laughable proposals to send people thousands of miles away or put wave machines in the Channel just so they can ‘look tough’ on immigration.”"
2020-07-03T05:30:13Z,Refugee victims of Tajoura bombing still lie in unmarked graves one year on,"One year on from the migrant detention centre bombing in Tajoura, eastern Tripoli, dozens of refugees and migrants who died have never been formally identified. At least 53 people were killed and 130 injured on the night of 2 July 2019, according to the UN, after an airstrike by a foreign aircraft supporting eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar’s forces hit a hall where migrants and refugees were locked up. Many of the victims had previously tried to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, but were caught and returned by the Libyan coastguard, which is supported by the European Union. Dozens of the dead were buried in graves marked only with a serial number; according to aid workers, no attempts were made to contact their relatives. Though several were carrying identification, the only victim whose full name became public appears to be an Ethiopian woman who was named by local media as Najaax Cabdi Sugaale. “When it comes to migrants it’s close to impossible here because most don’t have relatives in the country, they don’t have identification,” said an aid worker, on condition of anonymity. “So it becomes close to impossible to do any forensic response here. That was the case when this tragic incident happened last year. The authorities were not able to respond by the book, as most of the resources were not available [to them].” “To my knowledge, nobody took charge of this,” said another source. Survivors still in Libya planned to light candles, but were unable to properly mark the one-year anniversary on Thursday due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some sent messages to the Guardian asking for help. “We suffered a lot,” said one South Sudanese man. “We want to be out of this country in [a] safe place. We are not demanding specific countries or continents, but out of Libya.” A report by the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) – whose spokespeople did not respond to a request for an interview – described the aftermath of the bombing. “Upon entering the crime scene, we noticed the presence of human body parts, blood and debris spread in a chaotic way in the targeted location.” The report listed the death toll as 37. At the time, fighters and militias associated with the GNA were fighting forces associated with Haftar and his self-styled Libyan National Army. Survivors say the number of people who died was much higher, with at least 10 witnesses telling the Guardian they believe the death toll was above 100. “It’s sad to think that lives were lost that day and a lot of those people, a lot of those faces, are going to remain anonymous,” said Safa Msehli, a spokesperson with the International Organization for Migration. “We worked very closely with the Libyan Red Crescent and our staff, who were on location after the tragedy happened, were describing a horrific scene of body parts, faces disfigured … There’s no official registry of who is detained there [in Libya]. It leads to the wider issue of arbitrary arrests in Libya. There’s no clear process and no clarity on who is conducting these arrests and for what reason.” Msehli said at least 40 survivors, including those injured, returned to the countries they originally came from after the bombing. Tarik Argaz, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), said 58 survivors have since been moved to other countries: either Italy or to transit centres in Niger and Rwanda. Another 88 were due to be evacuated, he said, but that “was put on hold until the resumption of air traffic”. Dozens more paid smugglers to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. At least two drowned, according to others who made the journey. One Sudanese man, now in France, said his asylum claim has already been rejected. “We thank God for our salvation from the hell of Libya and curse him for our fall in the hell of Europe,” he said."
2020-10-21T14:50:58Z,Appeal court quashes UK policy of removing migrants with little warning,"The court of appeal has quashed a Home Office policy of removing migrants from the UK without access to justice. In a unanimous decision, three judges found the policy, which allowed the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK sometimes with only hours notice and in many cases without access to lawyers, to be unlawful. More than 40,000 removals were affected by the policy, resulting in vulnerable people being put at risk. Some were recognised as having been removed unlawfully, were brought back to the UK and granted leave to remain. Wednesday’s ruling will be a blow for the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has vowed to take a tough line on removing migrants from the UK. It also comes at a time when she has been reported to be considering making some definitions of human rights law for judges rather than leaving judges to decide these legal points for themselves. The judgment from the lord chief justice Lord Burnett, Lord Justice Hickinbottom and Lord Justice Coulson emphasises the importance of the right of access to justice under common law: “The right to access the court is an absolute and inviolable right … the right to access to the court is not a relative right to be balanced against other rights and interests.” The Home Office policy that has been quashed includes “removal windows”, whereby someone is given as little as 72 hours notice that they might be removed from the UK at some point during the subsequent three months, without any warning. The appeal court challenge was brought by the charity Medical Justice, the Public Law Project and Duncan Lewis solicitors. A Medical Justice spokesperson said: “One of our society’s most precious treasures is access to justice. Chillingly, away from the public gaze, this policy denied that fundamental right on a massive scale causing serious harm to extremely vulnerable people and risking life. It was effectively a shortcut to removal. Quashing the policy brings us back towards equal access to justice for all.” Rakesh Singh, a solicitor at the Public Law Project, said: “This is a case about access to justice, one of the fundamental values of the British constitution. The ‘removal windows’ policy shut people out of the legal process. It meant that when mistakes were made, people could not access the court to put things right, and led the Home Office to remove people with a right to be here – including a number who were caught up in the Windrush situation. “Removing people in this way caused terrible injustices and placed many individuals and families in danger and into hardship, unnecessarily and unjustly.” Raja Uruthiravinayagan of Duncan Lewis solicitors said: ‘The importance of this judgment cannot be overstated. Access to justice is a fundamental principle of rule of law. Without it, individuals will not be able to challenge unlawful decisions and hold decision-makers accountable. It protects our fundamental rights and freedoms. The delivery of justice should be impartial and non-discriminatory, regardless of who is seeking it, if it is to protect and strengthen our democracy.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our immigration and asylum system is fundamentally broken and we are determined to introduce a new system that is fair, firm and will expedite the removal of those who have no legitimate claim for protection.” Home Office sources said the court found that the removal windows interfered with an individual’s access to legal advice. It did not find that removal windows were unlawful. • This article was amended on 28 October 2020. An earlier version said that the policy could allow the forcible removal of a migrant from the UK within hours; this has been clarified to say the removal could be with only hours notice."
